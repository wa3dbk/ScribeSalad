00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.050
When I introduced you to the
unit step function, I said,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.440
you know, this type of function,
it's more exotic and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.240
a little unusual relative to
what you've seen in just a

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.900
traditional Calculus course,
what you've seen in maybe your

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.930
Algebra courses.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.990
But the reason why this was
introduced is because a lot of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.590
physical systems kind
of behave this way.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.700
That all of a sudden nothing
happens for a long period of

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.530
time and then bam!

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.630
Something happens.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.450
And you go like that.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.440
And it doesn't happen exactly
like this, but it can be

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.330
approximated by the unit
step function.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.390
Similarly, sometimes you have
nothing happening for a long

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.590
period of time.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.870
Nothing happens for
a long period of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.350
time, and then whack!

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.760
Something hits you really hard
and then goes away, and then

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.300
nothing happens for a very
long period of time.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.920
And you'll learn this in the
future, you can kind of view

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.200
this is an impulse.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.680
And we'll talk about
unit impulse

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.600
functions and all of that.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.760
So wouldn't it be neat if we had
some type of function that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.130
could model this type
of behavior?

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.360
And in our ideal function,
what would happen is that

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.910
nothing happens until we get
to some point and then bam!

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.150
It would get infinitely strong,
but maybe it has a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.630
finite area.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.970
And then it would go back to
zero and then go like that.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.660
So it'd be infinitely high right
at 0 right there, and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.630
then it continues there.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.530
And let's say that the area
under this, it becomes very--

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.880
to call this a function is
actually kind of pushing it,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.650
and this is beyond the math of
this video, but we'll call it

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.990
a function in this video.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.300
But you say, well, what good
is this function for?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.610
How can you even
manipulate it?

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.800
And I'm going to make one more
definition of this function.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.070
Let's say we call this function
represented by the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.090
delta, and that's what we do
represent this function by.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.420
It's called the Dirac
delta function.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.510
And we'll just informally say,
look, when it's in infinity,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.480
it pops up to infinity
when x equal to 0.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.525
And it's zero everywhere else
when x is not equal to 0.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.040
And you say, how do
I deal with that?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840
How do I take the integral
of that?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.220
And to help you with that, I'm
going to make a definition.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.620
I'm going to tell you what
the integral of this is.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.690
This is part of the definition
of the function.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.470
I'm going to tell you that if I
were to take the integral of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.510
this function from minus
infinity to infinity, so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.750
essentially over the entire real
number line, if I take

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.010
the integral of this function,
I'm defining it

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490
to be equal to 1.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.590
I'm defining this.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.600
Now, you might say, Sal, you
didn't prove it to me.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.670
No, I'm defining it.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.960
I'm telling you that this delta
of x is a function such

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.640
that its integral is 1.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.170
So it has this infinitely
narrow base that goes

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.810
infinitely high, and the area
under this-- I'm telling you--

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.090
is of area 1.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.380
And you're like, hey, Sal,
that's a crazy function.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.490
I want a little bit better
understanding of how someone

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.110
can construct a function
like this.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.520
So let's see if we can satisfy
that a little bit more.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.880
But then once that's satisfied,
then we're going to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.540
start taking the Laplace
transform of this, and then

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.240
we'll start manipulating
it and whatnot.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.240
Let's see, let me complete
this delta right here.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.420
Let's say that I constructed
another function.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.110
Let's call it d sub tau And this
is all just to satisfy

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.640
this craving for maybe a better
intuition for how this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.270
Dirac delta function
can be constructed.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.930
And let's say my d sub tau of--
well, let me put it as a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.690
function of t because everything
we're doing in the

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.280
Laplace transform world,
everything's been

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.600
a function of t.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.000
So let's say that it equals 1
over 2 tau, and you'll see why

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.290
I'm picking these numbers
the way I am.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.805
1 over 2 tau when t is
less then tau and

00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:51.260
greater than minus tau.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.640
And let's say it's 0
everywhere else.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.890
So this type of equation,
this is more reasonable.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.130
This will actually look like
a combination of unit step

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.120
functions, and we can actually
define it as a combination of

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.460
unit step functions.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.220
So if I draw, that's
my x-axis.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.680
And then if I put my
y-axis right here.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.930
That's my y-axis.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.710
Sorry, this is a t-axis.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.990
I have to get out
of that habit.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.980
This is the t-axis, and, I mean,
we could call it the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.430
y-axis or the f of t-axis, or
whatever we want to call it.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.160
That's the dependent variable.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.910
So what's going to
happen here?

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.820
It's going to be zero everywhere
until we get to

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.870
minus t, and then at minus
t, we're going to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.290
jump up to some level.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.820
Just let me put that
point here.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.825
So this is minus tau, and
this is plus tau.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.700
So it's going to be zero
everywhere, and then at minus

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.040
tau, we jump to this level, and
then we stay constant at

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.670
that level until we
get to plus tau.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.430
And that level, I'm saying
is 1 over 2 tau.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.080
So this point right here on the
dependent axis, this is 1

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.080
over 2 tau.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.630
So why did I construct this
function this way?

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.710
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.410
What happens if I take
the integral?

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.640
Let me write a nicer
integral sign.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.790
If I took the integral from
minus infinity to infinity of

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.700
d sub tau of t dt, what is this
going to be equal to?

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.100
Well, if the integral is just
the area under this curve,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.700
this is a pretty

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.900
straightforward thing to calculate.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.440
You just look at this, and you
say, well, first of all, it's

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.480
zero everywhere else.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.380
It's zero everywhere else, and
it's only the area right here.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.730
I mean, I could rewrite this
integral as the integral from

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.560
minus tau to tau-- and we don't
care if infinity and

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.870
minus infinity or positive
infinity, because there's no

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.280
area under any of those
points-- of 1

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.230
over 2 tau d tau.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.900
Sorry, 1 over 2 tau dt.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.460
So we could write it this
way too, right?

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.910
Because we can just take the
boundaries from here to here,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.130
because we get nothing whether t
goes to positive infinity or

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.130
minus infinity.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.380
And then over that boundary, the
function is a constant, 1

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.840
over 2 tau, so we could just
take this integral.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.310
And either way we evaluate it.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.990
We don't even have to know
calculus to know what this

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.680
integral's going
to evaluate to.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:41.340
This is just the area under
this, which is just the base.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:42.130
What's the base?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.275
The base is 2 tau.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.550
You have one tau here and
then another tau there.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.240
So it's equal to 2 tau
times your height.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.460
And your height, I just
said, is 1 over 2 tau.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.880
So your area for this function,
or for this

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.560
integral, is going to be 1.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.680
You could evaluate this.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.160
You could get this is going to
be equal to-- you take the

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.630
antiderivative of 1 over 2 tau,
you get-- I'll do this

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.230
just to satiate your curiosity--
t over 2 tau, and

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.750
you have to evaluate this
from minus tau to tau.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.310
And when you would put tau in
there, you get tau over 2 tau,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.550
and then minus minus tau over
2 tau, and then you get tau

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:33.850
plus tau over 2 tau, that's
2 tau over 2 tau,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.110
which is equal to 1.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.120
Maybe I'm beating
a dead horse.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.490
I think you're satisfied that
the area under this is going

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.300
to be 1, regardless
of what tau was.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.650
I kept this abstract.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.510
Now, if I take smaller and
smaller values of tau, what's

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:49.450
going to happen?

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:56.730
If my new tau is going to be
here, let's say my new tau is

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.357
going to be there, I'm just
going to pick up my new tau

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:03.320
there, then my 1 over
2 tau, the tau is

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.560
now a smaller number.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.250
So when it's in the denominator,
my 1 over 2 tau

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:12.210
is going to be something
like this, right?

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.670
I mean, I'm just saying, if I
pick smaller and smaller taus.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.380
So then if I pick an even
smaller tau than that, then my

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.900
height is going to be
have to be higher.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.750
My 1 over 2 tau is going
to have to even

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.010
be higher than that.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.860
And so I think you see where
I'm going with this.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.080
What happens as the limit
as tau approaches zero?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:41.169
So what is the limit as tau
approaches zero of my little d

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.380
sub tau function?

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.070
What's the limit of this?

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.370
Well, these things are going
to go infinitely close to

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.530
zero, but this is the limit.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.460
They're never going to
be quite at zero.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.050
And your height here is going to
go infinitely high, but the

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.400
whole time, I said no matter
what my tau is, because it was

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.340
defined very arbitrarily,
was my area is

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.130
always going to be 1.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:08.860
So you're going to end up with
your Dirac delta function.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.590
Let me write it now.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:10.430
I was going to write
an x again.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.630
Your Dirac delta function is a
function of t, and because of

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:22.130
this, if you ask what's the
limit as tau approaches zero

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.220
of the integral from minus
infinity to infinity of d sub

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.900
tau of t dt, well, this should
still be 1, right?

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.230
Because this thing right here,
this evaluates to 1.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.630
So as you take the limit as tau
approaches zero-- and I'm

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.940
being very generous with
my definitions

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.020
of limits and whatnot.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.330
I'm not being very rigorous.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.665
But I think you can kind of
understand the intuition of

00:09:43.665 --> 00:09:44.470
where I'm going.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.630
This is going to
be equal to 1.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.050
And so by the same intuitive
argument, you could say that

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:55.690
the limit from minus infinity to
infinity of our Dirac delta

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:01.600
function of t dt is also
going to be 1.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.000
And likewise, the Dirac delta
function-- I mean, this thing

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.370
pops up to infinity at
t is equal to 0.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.830
This thing, if I were to draw my
x-axis like that, and then

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.980
right at t equals 0, my
Dirac delta function

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.180
pops up like that.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.970
And you normally draw
it like that.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.730
And you normally draw it so
it goes up to 1 to kind

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.670
of depict its area.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.630
But you actually put an arrow
there, and so this is your

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.270
Dirac delta function.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.820
But what happens if you
want to shift it?

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.860
How would I represent my--
let's say I want

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:38.660
to do t minus 3?

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.700
What would the graph
of this be?

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.450
Well, this would just be
shifting it to the right by 3.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.100
For example, when t equals 3,
this will become the Dirac

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.160
delta of 0.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.630
So this graph will just
look like this.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.550
This will be my x-axis.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:58.610
And let's say that this
is my y-axis.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.330
Let me just make that 1.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.810
And let me just draw some points
here, so it's 1, 2, 3

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.360
That's t is equal to 3.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.390
Did I say that was the x-axis?

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.930
That's my t-axis.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:09.935
This is t equal to 3.

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.760
And what I'm going to do here is
the Dirac delta function is

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.125
going to be zero everywhere.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.870
But then right at 3, it
goes infinitely high.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.240
And obviously, we don't have
enough paper to draw an

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.230
infinitely high spike
right there.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.440
So what we do is we
draw an arrow.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.660
We draw an arrow there.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.890
And the arrow, we usually draw
the magnitude of the area

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.480
under that spike.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.110
So we do it like this.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.280
And let me be clear.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.600
This is not saying that the
function just goes to 1 and

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.720
then spikes back down.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.080
This tells me that the
area under the

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.400
function is equal to 1.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.810
This spike would have to be
infinitely high to have any

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:50.250
area, considering it has an
infinitely small base, so the

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.470
area under this impulse function
or under this Dirac

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.250
delta function.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.940
Now, this one right here is t
minus 3, but your area under

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.740
this is still going to be 1.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.415
And that's why I made
the arrow go to 1.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.050
Let's say I wanted to graph--
let me do it in another color.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:14.750
Let's say I wanted to graph
2 times the Dirac

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.520
delta of t minus 2.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.480
How would I graph this?

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.830
Well, I would go to t minus 2.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.010
When t is equal to 2, you get
the Dirac delta of zero, so

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.490
that's where you would
have your spike.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.550
And we're multiplying it by 2,
so you would do a spike twice

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.820
as high like this.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.250
Now, both of these go to
infinity, but this goes twice

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.460
as high to infinity.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.890
And I know this is all being
a little ridiculous now.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.940
But the idea here is that the
area under this curve should

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.590
be twice the area under
this curve.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.320
And that's why we make the arrow
go to 2 to say that the

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.020
area under this arrow is 2.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.200
The spike would have to
go infinitely high.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.060
So this is all a little
abstract, but this is a useful

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.770
way to model things that are
kind of very jarring.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.785
Obviously, nothing actually
behaves like this, but there

00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:06.160
are a lot of phenomena in
physics or the real world that

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.820
have this spiky behavior.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.460
Instead of trying to say,
oh, what does that spike

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.180
exactly look like?

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.360
We say, hey, that's a Dirac
delta function.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.420
And we'll dictate its impulse
by something like this.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.010
And just to give you a little
bit of motivation behind this,

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.200
and I was going to go here in
the last video, but then I

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.360
kind of decided not to.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.870
But I'm just going to show it,
because I've been doing a lot

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.370
of differential equations and
I've been giving you no

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.066
motivation for how this applies
in the real world.

00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:35.720
But you can imagine, if I have
just a wall, and then I have a

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.740
spring attached to some mass
right there, and let's say

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.550
that this is a natural state
of the spring, so that the

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.790
spring would want to be here,
so it's been stretched a

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.340
distance y from its kind of
natural where it wants to go.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:59.160
And let's say I have some
external force right here.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.330
Let's say I have some external
force right here on the

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.600
spring, and, of course, let's
say it's ice on ice.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.510
There's no friction
in all of this.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.940
And I just want to show you
that I can represent the

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.860
behavior of this system with
the differential equation.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.680
And actually things like the
unit step functions, the Dirac

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.520
delta function, actually start
to become useful in this type

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.660
of environment.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:24.610
So we know that F is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.240
That's basic physics
right there.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.940
Now, what are all
of the forces on

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.510
this mass right here?

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.490
Well, you have this
force right here.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.620
And I'll say this is a positive
rightward direction,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.780
so it's that force, and then
you have a minus force from

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.650
the spring.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.100
The force from the spring
is Hooke's Law.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.910
It's proportional to how far
it's been stretched from its

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.620
kind of natural point, so its
force in that direction is

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.880
going to be ky, or you could
call it minus ky, because it's

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.850
going in the opposite direction
of what we've

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:01.250
already said is a positive
direction.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.970
So the net forces on this is F
minus ky, and that's equal to

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:13.470
the mass of our object times
its acceleration.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:14.520
Now, what's its acceleration?

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:20.510
If its position is y, so if y
is equal to position, if we

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.070
take the derivative of y with
respect to t, y prime, which

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.570
we could also say dy dt, this
is going to be its velocity.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.210
And then if we take the
derivative of that, y prime

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:36.200
prime, which is equal to d
squared y with respect to dt

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.940
squared, this is equal
to acceleration.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:48.340
So instead of writing a, we
could right y prime prime.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.110
And so, if we just put this
on the other side of the

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.010
equation, what do we get?

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.270
We get the force-- this force,
not just this force; this was

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.540
just F equals ma-- but this
force is equal to the mass of

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.610
our object, times the
acceleration of the object

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.400
plus whatever the spring
constant is for the spring

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.140
plus k times our position,
times y.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.580
So if you had no outside force,
if this was zero you'd

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.370
have a homogeneous differential
equation.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.150
And in that case, the spring
would just start

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.560
moving on its own.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.590
But now this F, all of a
sudden, it's kind of a

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.610
non-homogeneous term, it's what
the outside force you're

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.900
applying to this mass.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.780
So if this outside force was
some type of Dirac delta

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.310
function-- so let's say it's t
minus 2 is equal to our mass

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:50.190
times y prime prime plus our
spring constant times y, this

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.180
is saying that at time is equal
to 2 seconds, we're just

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.770
going to jar this thing
to the right.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.960
And it's going to have an-- and
I'll talk more about it--

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.360
it's going to have
an impulse of 2.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.280
It's force times time is going
to be-- or its impulse is

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.910
going to have 1.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.560
And I don't want to get too much
into the physics here,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.630
but its impulse or its change in
momentum, is going to be of

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.430
magnitude 1, depending on
what our units are.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.890
But anyway, I just wanted to
take a slight diversion,

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.329
because you might think Sal is
introducing me to these weird,

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.349
exotic functions.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.569
What are they ever going
to be good for?

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:27.369
But this is good for the idea
that sometimes you just jar

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.750
this thing by some magnitude
and then let go.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.790
And you do it kind of infinitely
fast, but you do it

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.540
enough to change the momentum of
this in a well-defined way.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.140
Anyway, in the next video, we'll
continue with the Dirac

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:41.870
delta function.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.830
We'll figure out its Laplace
transform and see what it does

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.650
to the Laplace transforms
of other functions.
