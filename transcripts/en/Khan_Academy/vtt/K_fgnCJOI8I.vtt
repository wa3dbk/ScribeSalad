00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.540
What I want to do in this video
is establish a reasonably

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.540
powerful condition in which we
can establish that at vector

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.350
field, or that a line integral
of a vector field is

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.670
path independent.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.420
And when I say that, I mean
that let's say I were to take

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.780
this line integral along the
path c of f dot d r, and let's

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.310
say my path looks like this.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.020
That's my x and y axis, and
let's say my path looks

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
something like this: I start
there and I go over

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.510
there to point c.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.050
My end point, the
curve here is c.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.210
And so I would evaluate this
line integral, this victor

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.640
field along this path.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.420
This would be a path
independent vector field, or we

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.890
call that a conservative vector
field, if this thing is equal

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.370
to the same integral over a
different path that has

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.240
the same end point.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.250
So let's call this c1, so
this is c1, and this is c2.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.680
This vector field is
conservative if I start

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.530
at the same point but I
take a different path.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.050
Let's say I go something like
that: if I take a different

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.600
path-- and this is my c2 --I
still get the same value.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.190
What this is telling me is that
all it cares about to evaluate

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.980
these integrals is my starting
point and my ending point.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.750
It doesn't care what
I do in between.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.410
It doesn't care how I get
from my starting point

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.140
to my end point.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.610
These two integrals have the
same start point and same end

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.320
point, so irregardless of
their actual path, they're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.350
going to be the same.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.530
That's what it means for f to
be a conservative field, or

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.670
what it means for this integral
to be path independent.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.080
So before I prove or I show you
the conditions, let's build

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.560
up our tool kit a little bit.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.750
And so you may or may not
have already seen the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.590
multivariable chain rule.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.850
And I'm not going to prove
it in this video, but I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.390
think it'll be pretty
intuitive for you.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.000
So maybe it doesn't need to
have a proof, or I'll prove it

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.560
eventually, but I really just
want to give you the intuition.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.610
And all that says is that if I
have some function-- let's say

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
I have f of x and y, but x and
y are then functions of, let's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.220
say a third variable, t, so f
of x of t and y of t --that the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.720
derivative of f with respect
to t is multivariable.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.000
I have two variables
here in x and y.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.810
This is going to be equal
to the partial of f

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.350
with respect to x.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.130
How fast does f change as x
changes times the derivative of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.120
x with respect to t-- This is a
single variable function right

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.780
here, so you to take a
regular derivative.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.140
So times how fast x changes
with respect to t.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.680
This is a standard derivative,
this is a partial derivative,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.290
because at that level we're
dealing with two variables.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.280
And we're not done. --plus how
fast f changes with respect to

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.960
y times the derivative
y with respected t.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.110
So d y d t.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.490
And I'm not going to prove
it, but I think it makes

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.730
pretty good intuition.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.950
This is saying, as I move
a little bit d t, how

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.290
much of a d f do I get?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.200
Or how fast this f change
with respect to t?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.400
It says, well there's two ways
that f can change: it can

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.670
change with respect to x and it
can change with respect to y.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.170
So why don't I add those two
things together as they're both

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.020
changing with respect to t?

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.940
That's all it's saying, and if
you kind of imagined that you

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.090
could cancel out this partial x
with this d x, and this partial

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.550
y with this d y, you could kind
of imagine the partial of f

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.200
with respect to t on the x side
of things, and then plus the

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.650
partial of f with respect
to t in the y dimension.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.930
And then that'll give you
the total change of f

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.150
with respected to t.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.560
Kind of a hand-wavy argument
there, but at least to me this

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.900
is a pretty intuitive formula.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.420
So that's our tool kit right
there; the multivariable

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.450
chain rule.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.040
We're going to put that
aside for a second.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.090
Now let's say I have some
vector field f-- and it's

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.100
different than this f, so I'll
do it in a different color;

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.660
magenta --I have some
vector field f that is a

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.920
function of x and y.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.380
And let's say that it happens
to be the gradient of

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.705
some scalar field.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.440
I'll call that capital F.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.060
And this is gradient which
means that capital F is also

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.230
function of x and y-- so I
don't want to write it on a new

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.890
line, I could also write up
here; capital F is also a

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.470
function of x and y --and the
gradient, and all that means is

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.150
that the vector field f of xy--
lower-case f of xy, is equal to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.710
the partial derivative of
upper-case F with respect to x

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.250
times the i-unit vector plus
the partial of upper-case F

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.690
with respect to y times
the j-unit vector.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.170
This is the definition of
the gradient right here.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.480
And if you imagine that
upper-case F is some type of

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:48.530
surface-- so this is uppercase
F of xy --the gradient F of xy

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.390
is going to be a vector field
that tells you the direction of

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.440
steepest descent at any point.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.740
So it'll be defined
the xy plane.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.060
So on the xy plane it'll tell
you-- so let me draw; that's

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.820
the vertical axis, maybe that's
the x axis, that's the y axis

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.150
--so the gradient of it, if you
take any point on the xy plane,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.240
it'll tell you the direction
you need to travel to go

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.610
into the deepest descent.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.320
And for this gradient
field it's going to be

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.700
something like this.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.730
And maybe over here it starts
going in that direction because

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.800
you would descend towards
this little minimum

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.260
point right here.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.770
Anyway, I don't want
to get too involved.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.960
And the whole point of this
isn't to really get the

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.050
intuition behind gradients;
there are other videos on this.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.960
The point of this is to get
other a test to see whether

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.290
something is path independent;
whether a vector field is path

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.050
independent, whether
it's conservative.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.010
And it turns out that if this
exists-- and I'm going to prove

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:57.350
it now --if f is the gradient
of some scalar field,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.630
then f is conservative.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.900
Or you could say it doesn't
matter what path we follow when

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.670
we take a line integral over f,
it just matters about our

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.950
starting point and
our ending point.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.030
Now let me see if I can
prove that to you.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.820
So let's start with the
assumption that f can be

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.560
written this way, as the
gradient, that lower-case f can

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.120
be written as the gradient
of some upper-case F.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:36.490
So in that case our integral--
well, let's define

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.510
our path first.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.310
So our position vector
function-- we always need one

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.250
of those to do a line integral
or a vector line integral --r

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:52.890
of t is going to be equal to x
of t times i plus y of t times

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.770
j 4t going between a and b.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.730
You've seen this multiple
times; this is a definition

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:04.950
of pretty much any path
in two dimensions.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:13.270
And then we're going to say f
of xy is going to be equal to

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.760
this: it's going to be the
partial derivative of uppercase

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.740
F with respect to x-- so we're
assuming that this exists, that

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.790
this is true --times i plus
the partial of upper-case F

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.210
with respect to y times j.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:42.470
Now, given this what is
lower-case f dot dr going

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.080
to equal over this
path right here?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.660
This path is defined by this
position function right there.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.970
Well, it's going to be equal
to, we need to figure out

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.280
what dr is, and we've done
that in multiple videos.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.480
I'll do that on the
right over here.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.740
dr, we've seen it
multiple times.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.980
Actually, I'll solve
it out again.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:11.590
dr over dt by definition was
equal to dx over dt times i

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.960
plus-- I don't know why it
got all fat like that

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.070
--dy over dt times j.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.630
That's what dr over dt is.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.320
So if we want to figure out
what dr is, the differential of

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.720
dr, if we want to play with
differentials in this way,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.490
multiply both sides times dt.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.520
And actually I'm going to
treat dt, I'll multiply

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.670
it; I'll distribute it.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:44.030
It's dx over dt times dti
plus dy over dt times dtj.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.460
So if we're taking the dot
product of f with dr, what

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.060
are we going to get?

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.960
So this is going to be the
integral over the curve from--

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.840
I'll write the c right there;
we could write in terms of the

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.790
end points as t once we feel
good that we have everything in

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.560
terms of t --but it's going to
be equal to this dot that,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.510
which is equal to-- I'll try to
stay color consistent --the

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:23.450
partial of upper-case F with
respect to x times that, times

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.520
dx over d t-- I'm going to
write this st in a different

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:35.850
color --times dt plus the
partial of upper-case F with

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:41.020
respect to y times--
we're multiplying the

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.950
j components, right?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.170
When you take the dot product,
multiply the i components, and

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.680
then add that to what you get
from the product of the j

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.400
components --so this j
component's partial of

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.830
upper-case F with respect to y,
and then we have times-- switch

00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:03.680
to a yellow --dy over dt times
that dt right over there.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.790
And then we can
factor out the dt.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.300
Or actually, so I don't have to
even write it again, right now

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.800
I wrote it without, well
let me write it again.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.035
So this is equal
to the integral.

00:11:16.035 --> 00:11:18.420
And let's say we have it in
terms of t; we've written

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.760
everything in terms of t, so t
goes from a to b, and so this

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.150
is going to be equal to-- I'll
write it in blue --the partial

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:33.610
of upper case F with respect to
x times dx over dt plus-- I'm

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.980
distributing this dt out --plus
the partial of uppercase

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.910
F with respect to y.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:42.200
dy over dt.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.530
all of that times dt.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.190
This is equivalent to that.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.950
Now you might realize
why I talked about the

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.640
multivariable chain rule.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.480
What is this right here?

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.100
What is that right there?

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.050
You can do some
pattern matching.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:04.180
That is the same thing as the
derivative of upper-case

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.950
F with respect to t.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.980
Look at this; let me let me
copy and paste that just

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.940
so you appreciate it.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.370
So this is our definition, or
this is our-- I won't say

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.920
definition; one can
actually prove it.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.040
You don't have to start from
there ---but this is our

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.220
multivariable chain
rule right here.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.890
The driven of any function with
respect t is the partial of

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.400
that function with respect to x
times dx over dt plus the

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.830
partial of that function
with respect to dy over dt.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.710
I have the partial of
upper-case F with respect to

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.650
x times dx over dt plus the
partial upper-case F

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.130
with respect to y.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.340
This and this are identical
if you just replace this

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.420
lower-case f with
an upper-case F.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.470
So this in blue right here,
this whole expression is equal

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:57.500
to the integral from t is equal
to a to t is equal to b of-- in

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:07.250
blue here --the derivative
of f with respect to dt.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.030
And how do you evaluate--
let me just the dt in green

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.980
--how do you evaluate
something like this?

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.790
I just want to make a point:
this is just this from the

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:16.540
multivariable chain rule.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.610
And how do you evaluate a
definite integral like this?

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:21.430
Well, you take the
antiderivative of the

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.120
inside with respect to dt.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.730
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:32.030
You take the antiderivative of
the inside, that's just f.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.192
So this is equal to f of t.

00:13:36.192 --> 00:13:38.410
And let me be clear.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.690
We wrote before that
f is a function.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:47.330
So our upper-case F is a
function of x and y, which

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.390
could also be written, since
each of these are functions

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:54.310
of t, could be written as
f of x of t of y of t.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.920
I'm just rewriting it
in different ways.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.430
And this could be just
written as f or t.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.550
These are all equivalent,
depending on whether you want

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.490
to include the x's or the
y's only, or the t's

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.310
only, or them both.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.370
Because both of the x's and
y's are functions of t.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.650
So this is the derivative
of f with respect to t.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.880
If this was just in terms of
t, this is the derivative

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.390
of that with respect to t.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.880
We take its antiderivative,
we're left just with f, and we

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.540
have to evaluate it from t is
equal to a to t is equal to b.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.730
And so this is equal to-- and
this is the home stretch

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:35.910
--this is equal to f
of b minus f of a.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.170
And if you want to think about
it in these terms, this

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.260
is the same thing.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:46.560
This is equal to f of x of b
over y of b-- let me make sure

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.970
I got all the parentheses
--minus f of x of

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.330
a over y of a.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:53.660
These are equivalent.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.320
You give me any point on the
xy plane, an x and a y, and

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.070
it tells me where I am.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.220
This is my capital F,
it gives me a height.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.800
Just like that.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:09.652
This associates a value with
every point on the xy plane.

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:13.370
But this whole exercise,
remember this is the

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.280
same thing as that.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.010
This is our whole thing that we
were trying to prove: that is

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:25.300
equal to f dot dr. f dot dr,
our vector field, which is the

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.890
gradient of the capital F--
remember F was equal to the

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.000
gradient of F, we assume that
it's the gradient of some

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.800
function capital F, if that is
the case, then we just did a

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.180
little bit of calculus or
algebra, whatever you want to

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.150
call it, and we found that we
can evaluate this integral by

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.170
evaluating capital F at t is
equal to b, and then

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.570
subtracting from that capital
F at t is equal to a.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.860
But what that tells you is that
this integral, the value of

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:58.980
this integral, is only
dependent at our starting

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:06.090
point, t is equal to a, this is
the point x of a, y of a, and

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:13.810
the ending point, t is equal to
b, which is x of b, y of b.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.020
That integral is only dependent
on these two values.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.300
How do I know that?

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.340
Because to solve it-- because
I'm saying that this thing

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.880
exists --I just had to evaluate
that thing at those two

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.890
points; I didn't care about
the curve in between.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:34.450
So this shows that if F is
equal to the gradient-- this

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.340
is often called a potential
function of capital F, although

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.590
they're usually the negative
each other, but it's the same

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:44.220
idea --if the vector field f is
the gradient of some scale or

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:56.490
field upper-case F, then we can
say that f is conservative or

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.980
that the line integral of f
dot dr is path independent.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.420
It doesn't matter what path we
go on as long as our starting

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.420
and ending point are the same.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.580
Hopefully found that useful.

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.680
And we'll some
examples with that.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.990
And actually in the next video
I'll prove another interesting

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.480
outcome based on this one.
