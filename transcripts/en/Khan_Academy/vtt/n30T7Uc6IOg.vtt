00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.430
We are on problem number
10 on page 489.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.400
Stacy noted that she is both the
12th tallest and the 12th

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.510
shortest student in her class.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.580
So let me write 12th down.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.050
She's the 12th tallest and
shortest. If everyone in the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.490
class is a different height,
how many students are

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.700
there in the class?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.310
And these are the type of
questions that I just like to

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.470
make sure that I'm
not miscounting.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.940
So she's the 12th tallest.
So what does that mean?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.110
That means that there are 11
people taller than her.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.460
So let's say from shortest to
tallest. So this is Stacy

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.650
right here.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.150
And so, if she is the
12th tallest-- let

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.890
me put it this way.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.220
If I said that she was the
first tallest, that means

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.420
there's no one taller
than her.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.510
If she's the second tallest,
that means there's one person

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.440
taller than her.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560
If she's the third tallest, that
means there's two people

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.660
taller than her.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.580
And likewise, if she's the 12th
tallest, that means that

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.240
there are 11 people taller.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.930
Similarly, if she's the 12th
shortest, well, that must mean

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.890
that there are 11 shorter
than her.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.250
So this is really just making
sure that you parse the words

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.290
correctly and count properly.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.820
So if there's 11 shorter, 11
taller, and then there's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.900
Stacy, well, that's
22 plus her.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.780
There's 23 students
in the class.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.920
And this is just to make sure
that you don't say, oh, 12

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.030
taller, 12 shorter, and say
25 or something like that.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.650
It's just to confuse you
really, I think.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.780
Problem number 11.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.510
Image.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.650
Clear image.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.680
Invert colors.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.200
Problem number 11.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.450
Switch colors.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.560
The quadratic function g is
given by-- this is just the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.970
general way people write
quadratic functions-- is equal

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.280
to ax squared plus bx plus
c, where a and c

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.530
are negative constants.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.000
Which of the following could
be the graph of g?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.310
So I'm not going to even
look at the choices.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.660
I'll just show you how I would--
if someone didn't even

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.610
give me any choices, and say,
well, if a and c are less than

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280
0, what's this going
to look like?

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.352
So let's draw the x and y.

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:33.320
So let's say that that
is the x-axis.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.730
Actually, I drew this--
let me edit, undo.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.130
OK.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.720
So let me draw the x-axis.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.490
You might realize pretty soon
why I have to redo this.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.740
The y-axis.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790
x, y.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.510
All right.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.060
So we know that a and
c are negative.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.030
So c is the y-intercept,
right?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.770
When x is equal to 0, we're
just left with g of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.710
x is equal to c.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.790
So c is the y-intercept.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.140
So if c is less than 0, we know
that the y-intercept is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.590
going to be below the x-axis.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.780
It's going to be a
negative number.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.360
We know that this is c.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.180
That's where the graph
intersects the y-axis.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.020
We also know it's going to be
symmetric around the y-axis.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.970
Well, actually, we don't know
for sure that it's going to be

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.620
symmetrical around the y-axis.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.630
And I could go into that in
more detail, but I won't.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.880
But that's all we
need to know.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.710
It depends what the bx--
this term-- is.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.290
But let's just ignore
that for now.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.310
And then we know that
a is negative.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.260
So in general, you might want
to prove it to yourself, you

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.560
know the graph of y
equals x squared.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.875
That opens up like this.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.650
And the graph of y is equal
to minus x squared.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.970
It goes down like that.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.590
So a possible graph for this
would look like this.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.300
The important thing is these
are the two things that you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.340
know when they tell you
a and c is negative.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.070
It's going to be a graph that
opens downwards, and it's

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:21.180
going to intersect the y-axis
in the negative area, below

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.520
the x-axis.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.660
A legitimate graph also would
have looked like this.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.890
It could have also
looked like this.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.310
It didn't actually have
to be symmetric.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.500
It depends what this
bx term does.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.450
But if we look at the choices,
the only choice that

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.330
intercepts the y-axis below
the x-axis at a negative

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.940
y-intercept and opens
down is choice A.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.680
There's only three choices
that open down, and only

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.540
choice A intercepts in
the negative area, so

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.150
the answer is A.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.520
It actually looks eerily
like what I drew,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.130
just out of the blue.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.380
Next question.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.930
Problem number 12.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.190
OK, so they drew a square.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.350
And I will draw a square,
because they drew a square.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.960
And they say this is A, this
is B, this is C, D.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.720
And this is P.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.110
This is Q.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.990
And out here is R.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.580
I don't know where this
problem's going, but it looks

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.120
interesting.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.600
Figure not drawn to
scale, of course.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.510
In the figure above, ABCD
is a rectangle, with

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.760
BC is equal to 4.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.940
AB is equal to 6.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.800
P, Q, and R are different points
on a line, not shown,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.850
that is parallel to AD.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.020
So P, Q, and R are apparently
all on the same line that is

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.640
parallel to AD.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.500
Well, I guess that is the
way they drew it.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.060
So let me erase.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.400
Let's just say this is Q.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.610
That R is down here.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.130
This isn't R.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.320
So they're all on
the same line.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.970
And they say the line
isn't shown, but

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.100
it's parallel to AD.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.200
So let me draw that line.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.116
So that line looks something
like this.

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:21.520
Let me draw it straight.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.310
And on that line, you have
P, Q, and R, and it

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.870
is parallel to AD.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.120
Good enough.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:37.220
Points P and Q are symmetric
about line AB.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.690
OK, so that means that P and
Q are equidistant from this

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.450
line, so that means that
this distance is

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.350
equal to this distance.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.300
When they say P and Q are
symmetric around AB, you can

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.720
almost pretend like AB's a
mirror right here, and P and Q

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.940
are the mirror images
of each other.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.380
Good enough.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.240
And then it also says
points Q and R are

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.460
symmetric around line CD.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.650
So we also know that
this distance is

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.440
equal to this distance.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.990
Good enough.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.680
What is the length of PR?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.100
This is fascinating.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.830
So let's say that this length
right here-- let me do it in

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.840
yellow-- this length is x.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.990
Then what is this green
length going to be?

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.800
This green length right here
is going to be 4 minus x.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
How did I know it
was 4 minus x?

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.025
Well, this distance
up here is 4.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.520
So this is x.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.800
This is 4 minus x.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.860
Well, then this distance right
here is also going

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.490
to be 4 minus x.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.070
And if this yellow distance is
x, then we also know that this

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.940
distance is x.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.630
So the distance from P to R is
going to be the sum of all of

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.240
these, right? x plus x plus
4 minus x plus 4 minus x.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.460
And I think you see where
this is going.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:30.920
It's x plus x plus 4 minus
x plus 4 minus x.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.360
These x's all cancel
out, right?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.520
2x minus 2x.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.990
And we're just left with 8.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.929
And that's our answer.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:37.919
B.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.929
And you could've tried it out.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.619
You could have assumed Q was
right in the middle, and it

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.340
would have worked out the same,
but you know for sure

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.360
that the answer is 8.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.990
Next problem.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.590
Image clear.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:51.680
Invert.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.010
I don't know if I'll
have time for this.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.200
The price-- I get nervous when
I'm running out of time.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.540
So I'm going to do this
in the next video.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.300
See you soon.
