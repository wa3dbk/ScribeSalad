00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.350
Let's say I have some subspace
V, that is a subset of Rn.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.690
And let's say that we also
have its orthogonal

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.820
complement, we write
that as V perp.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.410
That'll also be a
subset of Rn.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.520
A couple of videos ago, it might
have even been the last

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.820
video if I remember properly, we
learned that the dimension

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.040
of V, plus the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.850
V, which is also another
subspace, is going

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.220
to be equal to n.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.880
Remember dimension is just the
number of linearly independent

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.470
vectors you need to have
a basis for V.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.320
And the dimension here is the
number of linearly independent

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.960
vectors you need to have a
basis for the orthogonal

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.460
complement of V.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.410
Now given this, let's see if we
can come up with some other

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.340
interesting ways in which these
two subspaces relate to

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.760
each other.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.360
Or how they might relate to
all of the vectors in Rn.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.250
So the first question is, do
these two subspaces have

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.340
anything in common?

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.200
Are there any vectors that are
in common with the two.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.580
And to test whether there is,
let's just assume there is,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.830
and see what the properties of
that vector would have to be.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.470
Let's assume right here that I
have some vector x that is a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.230
member of my subspace V.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.630
Let's also assume that x is
a member of the orthogonal

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.880
complement of V.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.590
Now what does this second
statement mean?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:51.250
Membership in the orthogonal
complement means that x dot v,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.050
for any v that is a member of
our subspace, is going to be

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.590
equal to 0.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770
Let me write it this
way actually.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.660
x dot v is equal to 0
for any v that is a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.860
member of our subspace.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.620
That's what it means to be a
member of V's orthogonal

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.770
complement.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.130
Now we assume that x is
also a member of V.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.320
So that means that we can
stick x here as well.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.270
For any member of V.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.600
x is also a member of V.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.310
So that implies that x
dot x is equal to 0.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.990
Another way to write that is
that the length of x squared

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.970
is equal to 0.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.560
Or the length of x
is equal to 0.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.160
And that's only true
for one vector.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.110
You can even try it out
with the different

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.030
constituents of x.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.750
The only vector that that's
true for is the 0 vector.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.770
So x has to be equal
to the 0 vector.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.320
That's the only vector in Rn
that when you dot it with

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.210
itself you get 0, or whose
the square of its

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.750
length is equal to 0.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.510
And we've shown that many,
many, many videos ago.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.310
What this tells us is at that
the intersection between V and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.490
V complement-- this kind of
upside down U just means

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.840
intersection, it just means
where do these two sets

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.680
overlap-- the only place that
these overlap is with a subset

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.740
of the 0 vector.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.070
So if I were to draw all
of Rn like this.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.020
Let's say that this is Rn.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.820
And let's say I draw
the subspace V.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.300
And let's say I draw the
orthogonal complement to V.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.440
It's all of these vectors
right here.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.870
This is the orthogonal
complement to V right there.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.805
So this is V perp.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.920
These are all of the vectors
that when I dot it with any

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.765
vector here, I'm going
to get equal to 0.

00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:00.050
So this is V perp.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.410
The intersection, their overlap,
the only vector that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:10.030
is a member of both
is the 0 vector.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.640
That's their only
intersection.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.490
So that's fair enough.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.900
The only vector that's a member
of a subspace and its

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.500
orthogonal complement
is the 0 vector.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.220
Nothing too profound there.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.760
Let's see if we can come up with
some other interesting

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.010
relations between the subspace
and its orthogonal complement.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.240
Maybe some arbitrary
vectors in Rn.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.830
So let's just write down--
well we know that the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.910
dimension of our subspace
V is equal to k.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.400
If its equal to k, we know that
its dimension plus its

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.230
orthogonal complement has to be
equal to n, because we're

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.480
dealing in Rn.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.165
And we also know that the
orthogonal complement of V is

00:04:57.165 --> 00:05:00.470
a subset of Rn, I drew
it right here.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.030
The dimension of V
is equal to k.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.610
That's a k right there.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:13.290
And what's the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of V

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.470
going to be?

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.420
Well, when you add them
together-- I wrote that up

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.720
here-- they have to equal n.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.100
So this guy's going to
have to be n minus k.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.380
If you have k here.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.310
This guy's dimension is k, this
guy's dimension right

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.840
here if, it's n minus k, that
when you add these two up, k

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.930
plus n minus k is going
to be equal to n.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.760
So this guy will have a
dimension of n minus k.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.100
Now what does dimension mean?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.300
It means that that's the number
of linearly independent

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.690
vectors you need to
form a basis.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.720
I have k vectors as
a basis for V.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:56.540
I have v1, v2, all
the way to vk.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.940
And this is a basis for V, which
just means they're all

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.210
linearly independent.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.500
And they span V.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.850
Any member of V right here can
be represented as a linear

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.070
combination of these vectors.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.750
Now the dimension of the
orthogonal complement of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.965
V is n minus k.

00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:20.550
So we could have n
minus k vectors.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:31.030
Let's call them w1, w2, all
the way to wn minus k.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.600
We have n minus k of
these characters.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:41.020
And this set is a basis
for the orthogonal

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.260
complement of V.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.250
So any vector in here can be
represented as a linear

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.560
combination of these
guys right here.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.355
And all of these guys are
linearly independent.

00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:53.030
So you don't have any redundant
vectors there.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.110
Now let's explore.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.640
And I'll tell you where
I'm trying to go.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.830
I'm trying to see if I combine
these two sets, whether I get

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.860
a basis for all of Rn.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.390
That's what I'm trying
to understand.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:20.100
Let's just say that for some
constants c1 times v1 plus c2

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:30.720
times v2 plus all the way to
ck times vk plus-- for the

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.990
constants on these guys I'll use
d-- plus d1 times w1 plus

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:47.960
d2 times w2, all the way to
plus dn minus k times the

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.010
basis vector wn minus k.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.500
Let's say that I'm curious about
setting this sum equal

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:02.160
to 0, equaling the 0 vector
for some scalers.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.120
The scalers are these
c's and these d's.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.080
And we know that there's at
least one solution set of

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.700
scalers for which
this is true.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.490
We could multiply all of these
constants-- c1, c2, ck, d1,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.260
d2, all the way to dn minus k.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.030
They could all be 0.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:20.790
Or there might be more
than one solution.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.690
In fact, if the only solution is
that all of these constants

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:29.240
have to be equal to 0, then we
know that all of these vectors

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.030
are linearly independent with
respect to each other.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.990
And if they're all linearly
independent with respect to

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.919
each other, then we know that
they can be a basis for Rn.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.830
But we don't know that yet.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.460
We don't know that the only
solution to this is all of the

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.000
constants being equal to 0.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.240
So let's see if we can
experiment with

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.270
this a little bit.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.820
If we take this equation, which
I just wrote down, we

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.885
know that one solution is all of
the constants, the c's and

00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:55.110
d's equalling to 0, but
we don't know that

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.460
that's the only one.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.100
Let's just subtract all of the
w vectors from both sides of

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.900
this equation.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:02.880
So what are we going to get?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:09.990
We're going to get c1, v1
plus c2, v2 all the

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.975
way to plus ck, vk.

00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:15.750
And we're going to subtract
this from both

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.020
sides of the equation.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.180
It's going to be equal
to the 0 vector.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.510
Which is really just 0, I don't
even have to write it

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.600
down, but maybe I'll write
it down there just so you

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.040
understand.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.380
I'm just taking this equation,
I'm subtracting these guys

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.140
from both sides.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:40.870
So 0 vector minus d1, w1 plus
d2, w2 plus all the way to dn

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.920
minus k, wn minus k.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.510
All I did is I subtract these
terms right here from both

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.200
sides of this equation.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.900
I don't even have to write
this is 0 here,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.800
that's a bit redundant.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.290
So what I have here is I have
some combination of the basis

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.000
vector of V.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.880
So if I look at this, this is
some linear combination of the

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.650
basis vectors in V.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:17.030
If I call this a vector-- let
me call this some vector x.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:22.960
Let's say x is equal to
c1, v1 plus c2, v2 all

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.650
the way to ck, vk.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.950
We know that it's a linear
combination of our basis

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.630
vectors of V, so x
is a member of V.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.330
By definition, any linear
combination of the basis

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.380
vectors for a subspace
is going to be a

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.500
member of that subspace.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.210
Well, similarly, what do we have
on the right-hand side of

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.560
this equation?

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.960
On the right-hand side of this
equation, I have some linear

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.140
combination of the basis vectors
of V complement You

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.490
could put just put a minus all
along that, but that won't

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:15.550
change the fact that this is
some linear combination of V

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.570
complement's basis vectors.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:29.900
So this vector over here is
going to be a member of-- we

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.960
could also call this x.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.800
So x is equal to this, but its
also going to be equal to

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.110
this, and since it can be
represented as a linear

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:42.650
combination of the orthogonal
complement of V's basis

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.580
vector, or V perp's basis
vector, we know that this also

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.730
has to be a member of V perp.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.260
Let me just review this,
because it can be

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.980
a little bit confusing.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.110
I just set up this equation
right here.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.950
We know that there's at least
one solution-- all of the

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.920
constants equalling 0.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.470
Anyone could do this.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.660
Now I subtracted all of the
yellow terms from both sides,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.310
and I got this equality.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.430
The left=hand side of this
equality is linear

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.970
combinations of the basis
vectors of V.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:14.390
So any linear combinations of
the basis vectors of V is

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.030
going to be a member of V.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.720
That's the definition
of basis vectors.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.770
So if I set x equalling to this
letf-hand side, I can say

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.560
that x is a member of V.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.690
Well, if x is equal to the
left-hand side, it's also

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.540
equal to the right-hand side.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.040
The right-hand side is some
linear combination of V perps,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.160
or the orthogonal complement
of V's basis vectors.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.980
Which tells us that x is also
a member of V perp.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.960
Well, what does that mean?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.710
That means that x must
be equal to 0.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.240
I just showed you at the
beginning of the video, the

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.190
only vector that's a member of
a subspace and its complement

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.030
is the 0 vector.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:13:00.340
So we know that because these
are orthogonal complements, we

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.545
know that x must
be equal to 0.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.870
So just to reiterate, we know
0's has to equal both of these

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.040
sides of the equation.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.920
And these are the same
constants that we

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.560
had to begin with.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.570
But what do we know about
these two sets?

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.120
We know that the 0 vector
has to be equal to this.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.790
That's the only vector in Rn
that's a member both of V and

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.200
of the orthogonal
complement of V.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.380
Now, this is a 0 vector and we
have this linear combination

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.210
of V's being set equaling
to the 0 vector.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.920
What do we know about
these constants?

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.910
What does c1, c2, all the
way to ck have to be?

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.640
We know that v1 through
vk is a basis for V.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.890
That tells us that they span V
and that they are linearly

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.140
independent.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.030
Linear independence by
definition means that the only

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:21.330
solution to this equation right
here is that all of the

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.010
constants have to be 0.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:31.190
So linear independence tells
us that c1, c2, all the way

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.785
through ck must be 0.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.130
All of these guys right
here are 0.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.790
Which is the same as
all of these guys.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.380
All of these guys must be 0.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.310
Now let's look at
the right-hand

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:45.590
side of this equation.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.370
We could put the minus
all the way, but the

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.080
same argument holds.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.480
This linear combination
of V perp's basis

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.330
vectors is equal to 0.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.280
The only solution to this--
because each of these w1's,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:05.510
w2's, and wn minus k's are
linearly independent-- being

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.860
equal to 0 is all of
the constants have

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.280
to be equal to 0.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.130
That falls out of linear
independence.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.610
If this negative is confusing
you a bit, if it makes it look

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.180
different than that, you could
just multiply this negative

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.960
out and say minus d1 would have
to be equal to 0, minus

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.910
d2 would have to be 0,
minus d and minus k

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.170
would have to be 0.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.060
But it's the exact
same argument.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.800
Linear independence, which falls
out of the fact that

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.790
this is a basis set, implies
that the only solution to this

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.660
being equal to 0 is each
of the constants

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.330
being equal to 0.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.700
Well, that means that d1,
d2, all the way to dn

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.590
minus k must be 0.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.290
Let's go back to what
I wrote up here.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.690
This was the original equation
that we were

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.080
experimenting with.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.640
Just manipulating this
equation a bit and

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.885
understanding that the only
intersection between V and V

00:16:03.885 --> 00:16:04.950
perp is a 0 vector.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:09.890
And that you only have linear
independence if the only

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:15.080
solution to these vectors
equalling 0 is all of their

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.600
constants equalling 0.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.210
Then we know that all of these
terms, c1 through ck, d1

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.750
through dn minus k, they all
have to be equal to 0.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.710
That's the only solution to this
larger equation that I

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.950
wrote up here.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.620
Well, the only solution to this
large equation that I

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.960
wrote up here is that all of the
constants are equal to 0.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:42.360
That implies that if I were it
take the set right here of v1,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:49.270
v2, all the way to vk, and I
were to augment that with the

00:16:49.270 --> 00:17:02.360
basis vectors of V perp, which
are w1, w2, all the way to wn

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:07.050
minus k, that this is a linearly
independent set.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.480
And I know that because the only
solution to this equation

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.720
is each of these constants
having to be equal to 0.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.700
That's what linear independence
means.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.900
This implies this.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.760
Linear independence
implies that.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.620
We used the fact that linear
independence implies that all

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:34.100
of these equal 0 to get the fact
that c1 all the way to ck

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.450
was equal to 0.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.080
And then we use it again when
we set this thing also being

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.190
equal to the 0 vector.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.760
We knew that all of the d's
had to be equal to 0.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.930
I don't know if you remember,
the 0 vector came out from the

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.980
fact that that was the
only vector that is a

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.420
member of both sets.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.945
I know I'm being a little bit
repetitive, but I really want

00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:53.270
you to understand that this
proof isn't some type of

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.200
circular proof.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.210
That we just wrote this
equation, we wondered about

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.530
what the solution set is to it,
we rearranged it, we said

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.950
hey both sides of this equation
are members of both V

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:05.900
and V perp.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.085
The only vector that's
a member of

00:18:08.085 --> 00:18:09.210
both is the 0 vector.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.530
So both of these sides
of the equation have

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.710
to be equal to 0.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.170
The only solution to that is all
of these constants being

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.280
equal to 0, because
each of these are

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.960
linearly independent sets.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.450
So therefore all of these
constants have

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.590
to be equal to 0.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.490
And then this augmented set,
where if you combined all of

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.350
the basis vectors, that is
going to be linearly

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.380
independent.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.420
Now many, many, many, many, many
videos ago, we learned

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:53.320
that if we have some subspace
with dimension n, and we have

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:01.380
n linearly independent vectors
that are members of your

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:16.010
subspace, then those n linearly
independent vectors,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:24.660
or the set of your n vectors,
is a basis for the subspace.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:34.900
Now Rn is a subspace
of itself.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.370
Rn is an n dimensional
subspace.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:50.430
We could write the dimension
of Rn is equal to n.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:56.150
Now we have n linearly
independent vectors in Rn.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.010
So that tells us that these
guys right here

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:09.910
are a basis for Rn.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.240
We have n linearly independent
vectors.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.790
We have n minus k that are
coming from V perp.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.040
We have n that are coming
from V from their

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.570
basis for those subspace.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.270
So now we have a total
of n vectors.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.570
They're linearly independent.

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:25.780
They're all members of Rn.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.800
So they are a basis for Rn.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.050
Which tells us that any vector
in Rn can be represented by

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:35.950
linear combinations of these
guys, which is fascinating.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.020
So this is a basis for Rn.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:43.060
So that tells us that we can
take any vector-- let's say a

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.000
is a member of Rn,
some vector.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.030
That means since this is a basis
for Rn that a can be

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.110
represented to some linear
combination of

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.930
all of these guys.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:21:02.160
So it can be represented as C1
times V1 plus C2 times V2 all

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.830
the way to plus Ck
times with Vk.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.860
Let me use a different letter
just to make sure that you

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.550
understand that this is a
different equation that I'm

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:12.680
writing than I wrote earlier
in the video.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.390
So I can write this, and then
I can have some other

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:21.050
constants that say plus e1 times
our V perp basis vector

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:28.360
1 plus e2 times this guy plus
all the way to en minus k

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:32.570
times the n minus k basis
vector for V perp.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:35.860
I can represent any vector
in Rn this way.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.930
Or another way to say it.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.180
What is this?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:48.420
This is some vector that is a
member of our subspace V.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:56.600
And then this is some vector
over here that is a member of

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.380
the orthogonal complement
of V.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.380
This is just a linear
combination of V

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.070
perp's basis vectors.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.330
This is just a linear
combination

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.180
of V's basis vectors.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:12.380
So given that all of these
characters are a basis for Rn

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.520
tells us that any member of Rn
can be represented as a linear

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.900
combination of them.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:23.000
But that means that any member
of Rn can be represented as a

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.800
sum of a member of our subspace
V plus a member of

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.640
your subspace V perp.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.330
This is a member of V, and this
is a member of V perp.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.470
And that's a really, really
interesting idea.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.210
You give me a subspace and then
we can figure out its

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.550
orthogonal complement.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:51.290
Any other vector in Rn can be
represented as a combination,

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:55.720
or sum, of some vector in our
subspace and some vector in

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.110
its orthogonal complement.

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.230
Now the next question you
might be asking, is this

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.430
representation unique?

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.680
So is this unique?

00:23:09.636 --> 00:23:13.325
Well let's test it out by
assuming it's not unique.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:25.960
So that means that I have for
some vector a that is a member

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.650
of Rn, I can represent
it two ways.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:34.530
I can represent it as equalling
some member of my

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:39.250
subspace V, plus some member
of the orthogonal

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:40.110
complement of V.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.580
I can represent it that way.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.250
Or I could represent it as
some other member of my

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:48.290
subspace V plus some other
member of my orthogonal

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.310
complement.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:55.930
So x1, x2 are members
of V perp.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:01.050
And then v1 and v2
are members of V.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.990
If we assume it's not unique,
there's two ways

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.830
that I could do this.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.130
And I'm representing it
as these two vectors.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.730
Now clearly this side of this
equation is equal to that.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.780
These are both representations
of a.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.820
So we can rearrange
this a little bit.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.040
We could say that v1 minus v2--
if I subtract v2 from

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:24.300
both sides, I get v1 minus
v2 is equal to-- that's

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.790
subtracting v2 from both sides,
and if I subtract x1

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:31.065
from both sides-- x2 minus x1.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.650
These are both members
of the subspace V.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.890
And any subspace is closed
under addition and

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.405
subtraction, which is really
a special case of addition.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.840
The vector v1, let me write it
this way, let me call my sum

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.850
vector z, being equal to both of
these guys which are equal

00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:59.810
to each other.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.720
z is the vector V1 minus V2.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.310
Any subspace is closed under
addition, if you take two

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.880
vectors and find their
difference in a subspace, then

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.800
that resulting difference
is also

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.520
going to be in a subspace.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.260
z is going to be a member
of our subspace V.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.360
This vector right here-- which
is also the same thing we just

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.490
said that to be equal our vector
z-- is going to be a

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.800
member of our V perp.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.170
Why?

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:37.800
Because both x1 and x2 are
members of the subspace V's

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.230
orthogonal complement.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.630
And that is a subspace
as well.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.580
So it is closed under addition
and subtraction.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.270
So this is also going to be
a member of your subspace.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.800
So we could also say that z is
a member of V perp or the

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.600
orthogonal complement of V.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.680
Well, we've done this
multiple times.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.140
This was the first thing
we showed in the video.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:02.300
The only vector that's a member
of a subspace and its

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.450
orthogonal complement
is the 0 vector.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.780
So z has to be equal
to the 0 vector.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.760
So this is equal to
the 0 vector.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.810
Well, if both of these are equal
to the 0 vector, we know

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:18.030
that v1 minus v2 is equal to
the 0 vector, which implies

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.120
that v1 must be equal to v2.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.060
And we also know that x2 minus
x1 is equal to the 0 vector.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.900
Or x2 is equal to x1.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.440
So we try to say that, hey,
there's two ways to construct

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.500
some arbitrary vector
a that's in Rn.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.300
And we wrote that down.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.140
But then we found out that no,
v1 must be equal to v2 and x1

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.720
must be equal x2.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.780
So there's only a unique way to
write any member of Rn as a

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.440
sum of a vector that's in our
subspace V and a vector that

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.880
is in the orthogonal
complement of V.
