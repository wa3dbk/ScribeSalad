00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.610
Let's do some examples dealing
with equations of lines in

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.080
standard form.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.980
So, so far we've had two
other forms. We've had

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.470
slope-intercept, which
is of the form, y is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.630
equal to mx plus b.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.920
That's actually this
right here.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.020
This is in slope-intercept
form.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.540
We've seen point-slope form
in the last video.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.190
That's of the form, y minus some
y-value on the line being

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.960
equal to the slope times x
minus some x-value on the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.670
line, when you have
that y-value.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.830
So the point x1, y1
is on the line.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.820
This right here is an example
of point-slope form.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.180
And now we're going to talk
about the standard form.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.790
And the standard form-- let me
write it here-- standard form

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.680
is essentially putting all of
the x and y terms onto the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.170
left-hand side of
the equation.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.570
So you get ax plus
by is equal to c.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.510
I want to really emphasize that
all of these are just

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.190
different ways of writing
the same equation.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.655
If you're given this, you can
out algebraically manipulate

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.510
it to get to that or to that.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.080
If you're given that, you
can get to that or that.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.590
These are all different ways
of writing the exact same

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.110
relationship, the
exact same line.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.170
So let's do a couple of
examples of this.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.380
So here we have a
line right here.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
We have an equation written
in slope-intercept form.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.250
The slope is 3, the y-intercept
is negative 8.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340
Let's put it into
standard form.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.270
So we just have to get
the 3x onto the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.690
other side of the equation.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.465
And the best way I can think of
doing that-- let me rewrite

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:51.560
the equation, y is equal to 3x
minus 8-- let's some subtract

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.180
3x from both sides
of the equation.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.500
So if you subtract 3x from both
sides-- so you subtract

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.380
3x, subtract 3x-- what do the
left- and right-hand sides of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.600
the equation become?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.470
The left-hand side becomes
negative 3x plus y being equal

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.560
to-- the 3x and the negative 3x
cancel out-- being equal to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.150
negative 8.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.050
We're done.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.590
That's standard form
right there.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.610
Standard form, I guess people
like it because it has both

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.680
the coefficients on the
left-hand side.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280
But it's kind of useless in
trying to figure out slope and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.130
y-intercept.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.200
I don't know what the slope and
y-intercept is when I look

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.100
at it in standard form.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.490
My favorite is slope-intercept
form, because it tells you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790
exactly the slope and
an intercept.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.140
Point-slope, easy to get to,
and you can look at it and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.560
figure out the slope.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.870
But y-intercept, you have to
do a little bit of work to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.630
figure it out.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.315
But at least you can just go
immediately from the slope and

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:53.570
a point to it.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.240
But anyway, let's go from this
equation, which is written in

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.360
point-slope form, and get
it to the standard form.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640
So we want to get it to the
standard form, to the same

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.250
type of standard form.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.150
So a good thing to do, let's
just distribute things out. y

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.700
minus 7 is equal to negative 5
times x, negative 5x, plus

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.370
negative 5, times negative
12, which is positive 60.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.760
Now, we want all of the variable
terms on the left,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.190
all of the constant terms
on the right.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.440
So let's add 7 to both sides
of this equation.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.440
So plus 7 to both sides
of this equation.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.800
What does it become?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.100
Well, the minus 7 disappears,
because negative 7 plus 7.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.920
So you're just left with
a y being equal to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.000
negative 5x plus 67.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.370
Now, if we want this x term on
the left-hand side, we could

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.010
add 5x to both sides.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.660
So let's add 5x to both sides
of this equation.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.250
And we will get y plus 5x
is equal to-- these

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880
cancel out-- 67.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.620
Now, this is pretty much
standard form.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.230
If you really want to be a
stickler for it, you can

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.579
rearrange these two.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.685
So it'd be 5x plus
y is equal to 67.

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:23.390
And you are done.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.630
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.950
So this is in neither
point-slope nor in

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.070
slope-intercept form.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.920
It's just in some type
of intermediary

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.470
mixed form right there.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.080
This looks like some type of
point-slope, but this looks

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.060
like something different.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.710
So it's really not
point-slope.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.490
Let's see if we can
algebraically manipulate it to

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.050
the standard form.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.570
So we get 3y plus 5.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.780
Let's distribute out this 4.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.950
So it's equal to 4x minus 36.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.920
Let's do exactly what
we did in the last.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.370
I'm using different notation on
purpose, to expose you to

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.110
different things.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.320
So instead of doing it this way,
I'm going to subtract 5

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.290
from both sides, but I'm going
to do it on the same line.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.440
So I'm going to subtract
5 from both sides.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.330
And so the left-hand side of
this equation becomes 3y,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.220
because these two guys cancel
out, and that is equal to 4x.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.290
And then what is minus
36 minus 5?

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.470
That's minus 41.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.000
And now we want the x terms
of the left-hand side.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.330
So let's subtract 4x from both
sides of this equation.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.920
So negative 4x plus,
and then minus 4x.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.980
What does our equation become?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.330
Well, the left-hand side just
stays negative 4x plus 3y.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.400
And the right-hand, the reason
why we subtracted 4x is so it

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.780
cancels out with that.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.800
You just have a negative 41.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.990
And we're done.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.970
We are in standard form.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.460
Now, let's go the other way.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.220
Let's start with some equations
in standard form and

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.090
figure out their slope
and y-intercept.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.080
And the best way I know to
figure out the slope and

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.460
y-intercept is to put it into
slope-intercept form.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.310
So we want to put these
equations right here into the

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.820
form, y is equal to mx plus b.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.740
So we're essentially
solving for y.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.510
Let's do that.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.420
So the best thing to do here--
so let me rewrite it.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.860
5x minus 2y is equal to 15.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.680
Let's subtract 5x
from both sides.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.530
So minus 5x plus, you
have a minus 5x.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.690
These cancel out.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.310
And so you're left with
negative 2y is

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.580
equal to 15 minus 5x.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.750
And now, let's divide everything
by negative 2.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.960
If you divide everything by
negative 2, what do we get?

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.620
The left-hand side
just becomes a y.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.530
y is equal to-- 15 divided by
negative 2 is negative 7.5.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.310
And then negative 5 divided by
negative 2-- you can imagine

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.540
I'm distributing the negative
1/2 if you will.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.410
I'm dividing both of these
by negative 2.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.955
So negative 5 divided by
negative 2 is positive 2.5x.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.820
And if you really wanted to put
it in the slope-intercept

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.760
form, you could say that y is
equal to-- you could just

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.030
rearrange these--
2.5x minus 7.5.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.430
You want the slope.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.710
It's right here.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.490
That is our slope.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.070
You want the y-intercept.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.690
Actually, let me be careful.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.110
It is right there.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.230
It is negative 7.5.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.520
That is the y-intercept.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.090
And now this would be a form
that's actually pretty

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.650
straightforward to
graph it in.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.120
Let's do this one.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.320
So once again, we just
need to solve for y.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.990
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.100
So you get 6y is equal
to 25 minus 3x.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.560
And then you can divide
both sides by 6.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.870
So you're left with y is equal
to 25 over 6 minus 3 over 6,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.060
or minus 1/2x.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.550
If you really want it in this
from, you just rearrange this.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:22.980
y is equal to negative
1/2x plus 25 over 6.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.610
Where is the slope?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.890
Here is the slope.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.670
Negative 1/2, that
is the slope.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.220
Where is the y-intercept?

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.790
That's the y-intercept.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.030
That is our b.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.830
The point 0, 25 over
6 is on the line.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.240
Let's do one more of these.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.080
So we get 9x minus
9y is equal to 4.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.670
Just for fun, let's just start
off by dividing both sides of

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.960
the equation by 9.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.080
You don't have to
do it that way.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.100
But this is kind of a fun way
to do it, because the

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.460
coefficients here will
immediately become 1.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.250
So if you divide both sides of
the equation by 9, if you

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.970
divide everything by 9, it
becomes-- actually, well,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.960
let's divide everything.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.530
Let's divide everything by
negative 9, even better.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.010
I'm just doing this for fun.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.140
So this first term will
become negative x.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.120
The second term, you have a
negative 9 divided by a

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.620
negative 9, it will
be a plus y.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.760
And then this last term
will just become a

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.800
negative 4 over 9.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.110
Actually, let me write
this out here.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.540
Negative 4 over 9.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.380
I'm giving some space there.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.270
Now, we want the x on the
right-hand side, so let's add

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.836
x to both sides of
this equation.

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.720
These cancel out.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.960
And then the equation becomes
y is equal to x minus 4/9.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.530
Where is the slope?

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.460
The slope is the coefficient
on the x term.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.990
The slope is equal to 1.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.270
Where is the y-intercept?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.956
The y-intercept is
right there.

00:10:02.956 --> 00:10:06.040
It is negative 4/9.
