00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.530
Until about 2006, if you talk
to anyone, especially real

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.150
estate agents, they'd always
tell you that on average,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.660
nationwide, that housing always
goes up in price.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.930
There could be layoffs.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.780
And maybe oil drops off and
people have layoffs in Texas,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.210
so housing prices go
down in Texas.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.250
Or they have layoffs in
Michigan, so housing prices go

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.710
down there.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.040
But nationwide, housing prices
do nothing but go up.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.910
And that, for the most part, has
been true since the Great

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.410
Depression.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.980
Housing prices have been going
up, maybe 1% or so per year.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.660
Actually a little bit less in
real terms. But something

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.810
fundamentally amazing happened
in the beginning

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.890
part of this decade.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.590
I have right here, this is
the Case-Shiller index.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.300
And this is probably the best
estimate of housing

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.130
prices I can find.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.300
This is better than the
median, because the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Case-Shiller actually tries to
compare the price you pay for

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.200
the same house.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.090
And maybe I'll do another
video later on how they

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.210
exactly do that.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.350
But if we look at the
Case-Shiller index.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.040
Let's see, in 2000 -- that's
where they index it to -- a

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.090
house that cost, you know,
$100,000 in 2000.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.250
Or, the index was at
$100,000 in 2000.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.310
By 2004 houses nationwide --
this is the national index

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.290
right here -- nationwide, prices
had increased by 46%.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.620
And by 2006, where they peak,
they had increased by 88%.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.170
They had almost doubled since
the price in 2000.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.450
And so the obvious question
is, why did this happen?

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.520
What drove prices to
increase so fast?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.670
When really, for most of the
history of America, housing

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.830
prices have never increased
this fast. Especially

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.310
considering what was happening
in the broader economy.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.010
What do I mean by that?

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.720
Well for the price
of anything to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.380
increase, what has to happen?

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.110
Well the demand has to increase
faster than the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.530
supply, right?

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.170
So let's look at possible
theories.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.960
What are demand drivers
that could make

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.100
housing prices go higher?

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.290
Let me write that in green.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.950
Demand drivers.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.350
Well maybe the population grew
faster than the housing stock?

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.190
When I say the housing stock, I
just mean that we're saying

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.690
just demand.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.850
So let me just say population.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.200
Housing stock is supply.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.060
So population goes up.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.920
That's a demand driver.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.810
What's another demand driver?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.150
Incomes go up.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.400
Right?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.090
That's another reason.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.000
Maybe if a lot of people just
become a lot richer, they're

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.180
willing to pay for houses.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.160
And what are the
supply drivers?

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.850
Well these are just
new homes built.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.640
So if you buy the classical
supply-demand argument, why

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.170
housing prices increased by 40%
from 2000 to 2004, or why

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.090
they increased by 80% from 2000
to 2006, these dynamics

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.330
should have grown faster
than these dynamics.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.380
So the population -- or maybe
the total income, if you took

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.130
the population and incomes--
grew faster than

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.810
the new homes built.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.430
So let's see if that's true.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.720
So I found this New York
Times article.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.600
And you could do some Google
searches, and I'm sure you can

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.670
find probably better data.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.470
This is just me doing a very
fast search on this stuff.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.740
Let me see if I can get it up.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.510
OK, here it is.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.200
So this is from a New
York Times article.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.610
This is a little graph.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.270
And this is showing the average
of incomes reported on

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.850
all tax returns.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.850
So notice, from 2000 to 2004
the average reported

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.360
actually went down.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.290
It actually went down
from 2000 to 2004.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.140
And this is interesting.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.860
Let me see if I can bring
this in here.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.980
So here they say total reported
income in 2004

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.570
dollars -- so they adjusted for
inflation -- fell 1.4%.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.910
But because the population
grew during that period,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.330
average real incomes declined
more than twice as much,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.650
falling by $1,641
a year, or 3%.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.680
So what are they saying?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.230
They're saying the total income
fell by 1.4%, but the

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.430
population must have grown by
about 1.5%, and so the average

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.900
per capita was 3%.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.100
So let me write that
in summary.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.770
So what do we know?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.080
What happened?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.290
We know from 2000 to 2004 -- and
this is nationwide -- we

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:44.490
know that the population
increased by roughly 1.5%.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.290
So not by much.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.750
I mean this is over a
four-year period.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.200
So per year, it was growing
by less than 1%.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.910
And then if you go to the income
per person, or actually

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.310
this is probably, well, this
is income for tax filing.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.750
But that's a pretty
good proxy.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.140
Income for tax filing,
that declined by 3%.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.320
So the total money available,
that New York Times article

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.840
just showed us, actually
declined.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.610
By, what did they
say, by 1.4%.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.010
So the argument that somehow
there's more money out there,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.010
chasing the same number of
homes, or a slightly larger

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.350
number of homes, doesn't really
carry much weight.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.250
But let's just make sure.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.550
Maybe for some reason, maybe
houses were destroyed.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.210
Or the number of homes built
just didn't keep pace with

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.450
this population increase.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.260
So let's see what data
we can find on that.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.620
Well actually I found
this thing.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.160
This says that -- this was
in 1999 -- they say the

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.550
composition of estimated 115
million housing units in the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.240
United States.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.170
So we can say, roughly, that
in 2000 that there were 115

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.433
million housing units.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.620
So let's see.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.300
Over this time period,
roughly how many

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.270
housing units were built?

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.230
What percentage did the housing
stock increase by?

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.910
And I found this data here.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.840
And this is annualized new
home builds by year.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.700
And I'm not going to go through
all of the math.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.620
But if you see -- let's see,
if I go back to 2000.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.740
I know this might be hard
for you to see.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.570
But if we pick up pretty much
any month from 2000, 2001.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.850
This is in thousands.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.280
So on an annualized basis,
maybe 1.5 million homes.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.310
This was in 2000.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.950
But it started accelerating,
all the way to 2004.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.900
By 2004, we were building
roughly 2

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.280
million homes a year.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.280
So over that time period, we can
say, on average -- you can

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.150
work the numbers to get an exact
number, but it should

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.410
work out -- we were
building about 1.8

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.800
million homes a year.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.550
And we can assume that homes
destroyed were pretty

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.700
negligible.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.610
I'm not aware of most
neighborhoods where they were

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.500
bulldozing homes.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.080
If anything, they were just
renovating homes.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.650
But these are brand new homes.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.510
So over that four year period --
and I'm just going to focus

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.400
there because that's where we
got data from that New York

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.330
Times article -- how many
homes were built?

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.945
Well, 1.8 times 4,
that's what?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.850
So roughly 7.2 million homes,
new homes, were built over

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:42.910
that time period.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.140
And we started with
a base of a 115

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.710
million, roughly, in 2000.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.460
So over that time period, the
housing stock increased by 6%.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:01.040
So the supply of homes
went up by 6%.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.470
So what's going on here?

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.510
From 2000 to 2004 we built
a ton of houses.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.730
The supply of homes
went up by 6%.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.310
People's incomes actually
went down, because

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.220
we were in a recession.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.150
People were getting laid off,
or they were just willing to

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.780
work for less.

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.600
Income went down.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.320
And the population
barely increased.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.470
And if we look at the total
dollars that were being

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.760
earned, that actually
went down.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.590
So the actual money out there
to pay for houses went down.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.110
And at the same time,
the total number

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.550
of houses went up.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.850
But at the same time, over this
exact same period, the

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.179
prices of houses
went up by 46%.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:38.460
Or, I forgot the number, but it
was 40-something percent.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.360
And it actually continued to
race up until 2006, where it

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.990
went up 80% relative to 2000.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.520
So this is bizarre.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.650
Basic economics would tell
us that if the supply is

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.610
increasing and the demand is
decreasing, prices, if

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.130
anything, should come down.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.520
So what happened?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.800
So I'm going to let you think
about that a little bit.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.910
There you have the supply-demand
thing that would

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.840
tell you prices went down.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.590
But not only did they not go
down, but they raced up faster

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.240
than they've ever done in
history, in the history of the

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.250
United States.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.500
So in the next video I'm going
to tell you, frankly, why I'm

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.290
pretty sure housing
prices did go up.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.710
See you soon.
