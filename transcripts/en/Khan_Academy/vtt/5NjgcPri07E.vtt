00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.930
We're told the triangle ABC
has perimeter P and inradius r

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.590
and then they want us
to find the area of ABC

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.129
in terms of P and r.

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:12.670
So we know that the
perimeter is just

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.900
the sum of the sides
of the triangle,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.430
or how long a fence
would have to be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.380
if you wanted to go
around the triangle.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.030
And let's just remind
ourselves what the inradius is.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.230
If we take the angle
bisectors of each of these

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.620
vertices-- each of these
angles right over here.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.850
So bisect that right over
there and then bisect

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.370
that right over there.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.910
This angle is going to
be equal to that angle.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.530
This angle is going to
be equal to that angle

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.860
and then this angle is going to
be equal to that angle there.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.470
And the point where those angle
bisectors intersect, that right

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.210
over there, is our
incenter and it

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.180
is equidistant from
all of the three sides.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.210
And the distance from those
sides, that's the inradius.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.836
So let me draw the inradius.

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:01.210
So when you find the distance
between a point and a line,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.584
you want to drop
a perpendicular.

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.050
So this length right over
here is the inradius.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.370
This length right over
here is the inradius

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.920
and this length right
over here is the inradius.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.700
And if you want, you could
draw an incircle here

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.330
with the center at the
incenter and with the radius r

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.450
and that circle would
look something like this.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.924
We don't have to necessarily
draw it for this problem.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:25.340
So you could draw a circle
that looks something like that.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.930
And then we'd call
that the incircle.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.850
So let's think about how we can
find the area here, especially

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.886
in terms of this inradius.

00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:34.510
Well, the cool thing
about the inradius

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.110
is it looks like the
altitude-- or this looks

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.280
like the altitude for this
triangle right over here,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.440
triangle A. Let's
label the center.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.090
Let's call it I for incenter.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.360
This r right over here is
the altitude of triangle AIC.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.710
This r is the altitude
of triangle BIC.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.020
And this r, which we didn't
label, that r right over there

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.170
is the altitude of triangle AIB.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.432
And we know-- and
so we could find

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:02.890
the area of each
of those triangles

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.210
in terms of both
r and their bases

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.030
and maybe if we sum up the
area of all the triangles,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.380
we can get something in terms of
our perimeter and our inradius.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.050
So let's just try to do this.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.440
So the area of the entire
triangle, the area of ABC,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.140
is going to be
equal to-- and I'll

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.100
color code this-- is going to
be equal to the area of AIC.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.890
So that's what I'm
shading here in magenta.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.750
It's going to be equal to
the area of AIC plus the area

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.551
of BIC, which is this
triangle right over here.

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.425
Actually let me do that
in a different color.

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.880
I've already used the blue.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.430
So let me do that in orange.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.890
Plus the area of BIC.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.160
So that's this area
right over here.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.960
And then finally plus the area--
I'll do this in a, let's see,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.216
I'll use this pink color--
plus the area of AIB.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.239
That is the area AIB.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.280
Take the sum of the areas
of these two triangles,

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.590
you got the area of
the larger triangle.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.030
Now AIC, the area
of AIC, is going

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.700
to be equal to 1/2
base times height.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.760
So this is going to be 1/2.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840
The base is the length
of AC, 1/2 AC times

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.030
the height-- times this
altitude right over here,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.410
which is just going
to be r-- times r.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.390
That's the area of AIC.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.280
And then the area of BIC is
going to be 1/2 the base,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.540
which is BC, times the
height, which is r.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.260
And then plus the area of
AIB, this one over here,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.620
is going to be 1/2
the base, which

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.580
is the length of this side
AB, times the height, which

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.090
is once again r.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.900
And over here, we can factor out
a 1/2 r from all of these terms

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:16.233
and you get 1/2 r times
AC plus BC plus AB.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.899
And I think you see
where this is going.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.324
Plus-- now that's a different
shade of pink-- plus AB.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.555
Now what is AC plus BC plus AB?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.607
Well that's going to
be the perimeter, P,

00:04:37.607 --> 00:04:39.190
if you just take the
sum of the sides.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.110
So that is the perimeter of P
and it looks like we're done.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:51.680
The area of our triangle ABC
is equal to 1/2 times r times

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.750
the perimeter, which is
kind of a neat result.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.635
1/2 times the inradius times
the perimeter of the triangle.

00:04:59.635 --> 00:05:01.510
Or sometimes you'll see
it written like this.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.680
It's equal to r times P
over s-- sorry, P over 2.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.290
And this term right over here,
the perimeter divided by 2,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.873
is sometimes called
the semiperimeter.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.940
And sometimes it's denoted
by s so sometimes you'll

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.760
see the area is
equal to r times s,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.595
where s is the semiperimeter.

00:05:24.595 --> 00:05:27.001
It's the perimeter divided by 2.

00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.750
I personally like it
this way a little bit

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.055
more because I remember
that P is perimeter.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:33.430
This is useful because obviously
now if someone gives you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.400
an inradius and a perimeter,
you can figure out

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.640
the area of a triangle.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.680
Or if someone gives you
the area of the triangle

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.513
and the perimeter, you
can get the inradius.

00:05:40.513 --> 00:05:42.630
So if they give you
two of these variables,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.140
you can always get the third.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.940
So for example, if this was
a triangle right over here,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.750
this is maybe the most famous
of the right triangles.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.235
If I have a triangle that
has lengths 3, 4, and 5,

00:05:55.235 --> 00:05:56.610
we know this is
a right triangle.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.674
You can verify this from
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:00.090
And if someone
were to say what is

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.420
the inradius of this
triangle right over here?

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.626
Well we can figure out
the area pretty easily.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.000
We know this is
a right triangle.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.800
3 squared plus 4 squared
is equal to 5 squared.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.370
So the area is going to be
equal to 3 times 4 times 1/2.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.040
So 3 times 4 times
1/2 is 6 and then

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.170
the perimeter here
is going to be

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.690
equal to 3 plus 4, which
is 7, plus 5 is 12.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.670
And so we have the area.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:35.720
So let's write this area is
equal to 1/2 times the inradius

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.510
times the perimeter.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.770
So here we have 12 is equal
to 1/2 times the inradius

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.750
times the perimeter.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.750
So we have-- oh
sorry, we have 6.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.720
Let me write this in.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.620
The area is 6.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.200
We have 6 is equal to 1/2
times the inradius times 12.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.170
And so in this situation,
1/2 times 12 is just 6.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.310
We have 6 is equal to 6r.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.560
Divide both sides by 6,
you get r is equal to 1.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.440
So if you were to draw
the inradius for this one,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.120
which is kind of a neat result.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.245
So let me draw some
angle bisectors here.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.570
This 3, 4, 5 right triangle
has an inradius of 1.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.980
So this distance
equals this distance,

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.530
which is equal to
this distance, which

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.290
is equal to 1, which is
kind of a neat result.
