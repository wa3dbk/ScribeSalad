00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.070
In the last couple of videos
we saw that we can describe

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.810
a curves by a position
vector-valued function.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.020
And in very general terms, it
would be the x position as a

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.750
function of time times
the unit vector in the

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.260
horizontal direction.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.010
Plus the y position as a
function of time times

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.040
the unit victor in the
vertical direction.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.120
And this will essentially
describe this-- though, if you

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.160
can imagine a particle and
let's say the parameter

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.620
t represents time.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.030
It'll describe where the
particle is at any given time.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.630
And if we wanted a particular
curve we can say, well, this

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.220
only applies for some curve--
we're dealing, it's r of t.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.130
And it's only applicable
between t being greater

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.710
than a and less than b.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740
And you know, that would
describe some curve

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.060
in two dimensions.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.120
Just me just draw it here.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.920
This is all a review of
really, the last two videos.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.050
So this curve, it might look
something like that where this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840
is where t is equal to a.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.610
That's where t is equal to b.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.260
And so r of a will be this
vector right here that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.440
ends at that point.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.170
And then as t or if you can
imagine the parameter being

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.210
time, it doesn't have to be
time, but that's a convenient

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.300
one to visualize.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.030
Each corresponding as t gets
larger and larger, we're just

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.310
going to different-- we're
specifying different

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.230
points on the path.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.070
We saw that two videos ago.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.470
And in the last video we
thought about, well, what does

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.110
it mean to take the derivative
of a vector-valued function?

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.030
And we came up with this idea
that-- and it wasn't an idea,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.550
we actually showed
it to be true.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.530
We came up with a
definition really.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.980
That the derivative-- I could
call it r prime of t-- and

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.220
it's going to be a vector.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.940
The derivative of a
vector-valued function is once

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.330
again going to be a derivative.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.060
But it was equal to-- the way
we defined it-- x prime of t

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.690
times i plus y prime
of t times j.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.880
Or another way to write that
and I'll just write all

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.160
the different ways just so
you get familiar with--

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.740
dr/dt is equal to dx/dt.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.330
This is just a
standard derivative.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.650
x of t is a scalar function.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.940
So this is a standard
derivative times i

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.610
plus dy/dt times j.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.680
And if we wanted to think about
the differential, one thing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.770
that we can think about-- and
whenever I do the math for

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.840
the differential it's a
little bit hand wavy.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.950
I'm not being very rigorous.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.855
But if you imagine multiplying
both sides of the equation by a

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:37.590
very small dt or this exact dt,
you would get dr is equal to--

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.740
I'll just leave it like this.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.330
dx/dt times dt.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.765
I could make these cancel
out, but I'll just write

00:02:43.765 --> 00:02:45.140
it like this first.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.950
Times the unit vector i
plus dy/dt times dt.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310
Times the unit vector j.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.510
Or we could rewrite this.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.570
And I'm just rewriting it in
all of the different ways

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.040
that one can rewrite it.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:09.070
You could also write this as dr
is equal to x prime of t dt

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.340
times the unit vector i.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.970
So this was x prime of t dt.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.010
This is x prime of t right
there times the unit vector i.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.750
Plus y prime of t.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.400
That's just that right there.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.210
Times dt.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.980
Times the unit vector j.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.000
And just to, I guess, complete
the trifecta, the other way

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.720
that we could write this is
that dr is equal to-- if we

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.980
just allowed these to cancel
out, then we get is equal

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.700
to dx times i plus dy
times dy y times j.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.630
And that actually makes a
lot of intuitive sense.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.860
That if I look at any dr,
so let's say I look at

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.325
the change between this
vector and this vector.

00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:57.300
Let's say the super small
change right there, that is our

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.390
dr, and it's made up of-- it's
our dx, our change in x

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.490
is that right there.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.350
You can imagine it's that right
there times-- but we're

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.740
vectorizing it by multiplying
it by the unit vector in

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.120
the horizontal direction.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.070
Plus dy times the unit vector
in the vertical direction.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.990
So when you multiply this
distance times the unit

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.633
vector, you're essentially
getting this vector.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.840
And when you multiply this
guy-- and actually our change

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.530
in y here is negative--
you're going to get

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.750
this vector right here.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.390
So when you add those together
you'll get your change in

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.370
your actual position vector.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.020
So that was all a little
bit of background.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.160
And this might be somewhat
useful-- a future

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.800
video from now.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.160
Actually, I'm going to leave it
there because really I just

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.910
wanted to introduce this
notation and get you

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.720
familiar with it.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.770
In the next video, what I'm
going to do is give you a

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.780
little bit more intuition
for what exactly does

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.780
this thing mean?

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.560
And how does it change
depending on different

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.540
parameterizations.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.780
And I'll do it with two
different parameterizations

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.110
for the same curve.
