00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.570
In the last video, we saw that
if we have two currents, or

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.880
two wires carrying current, and
the current is going in

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.160
the same direction, that they'll
attract each other.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.090
Now what would happen-- before
we break into the numbers--

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.260
what would happen if the two
currents are going in opposite

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.300
directions?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.980
Would they attract or
repel each other?

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.460
And you can probably guess
that, but let's

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.880
go through the exercise.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.240
Because I realize that last
time I did it, I got

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.880
a little bit messy.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.430
And I'll do it a little bit
cleaner this-- I don't have to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.280
draw as many magnetic
field lines.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.390
So let's say that's wire 1.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.640
That's wire 2.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.010
And I'll just make the currents
go in opposite

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.500
directions.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.750
So this is I1.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.420
And this is I2.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.390
So what would the magnetic
field created by

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.500
current 1 look like?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840
Well, let's do the
wrap around rule.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.090
Put our thumb in the direction
of the current, and then the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.870
magnetic field will
wrap around.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.200
It'll go into the page
here and it'll go

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.720
out of the page here.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.240
If you put your thumb
up like that.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.410
Your right hand, always
use your right hand.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.940
And then you'll get that
type of magnetic field.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.890
And of course, it's going into
the page, into the video

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.580
screen, all the way
out to infinity.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.170
It gets weaker and weaker.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.070
It's inversely proportional to
the radius away from the wire,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.960
so it'll get weaker
and weaker.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.160
But even here, this magnetic
field is going into the page.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.010
Now we know, just as a little
bit of review, the force

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.740
created by current 1 on current
2-- that's just the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.530
convention I'm using, you
wouldn't always put the 1

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.710
first-- is equal to current 2
times some length-- let's call

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.910
that length 2-- along
the wire.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.340
This is going to be a vector
because it's a magnitude of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.000
length and a direction.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.560
And it goes in the same
direction as the current.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.260
So let's say that that is L2.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.450
So we're talking about
from here to here.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.510
That's the current.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.780
Cross product that with
the magnetic field.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.130
I'll switch back to that.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.730
The magnetic field
created by 1.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.500
Now it all seems pretty
complicated, but you can just

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.400
take your right hand rule and
figure out the direction.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.350
So we put our index finger--
I'm doing it right now, you

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.400
can't see it-- you put your
index finger in the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.990
direction of L2.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.280
You can write the 2 down
here, instead of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920
writing a big 2 up there.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.500
Put your index finger in
the direction of L2.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.590
I keep redoing it just to make
sure I'm drawing it right.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.720
Put your middle finger in the
direction of-- so this is L2.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.030
This is this.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.180
Goes in the direction of
the middle finger.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.230
Sorry, the index finger.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.480
Your middle finger is
going to go in the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.390
direction of the field.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.580
So it's going to be pointing
downwards, because the field

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.830
is going into the page, on
this side of this wire.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.100
And then your other hands are
going to do what they will.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.520
And then your thumb is
going to go in the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.470
direction of the net force.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.710
So your thumb is going
to go like that.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:01.425
So there you have it.

00:03:01.425 --> 00:03:02.390
This is the top of your hand.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.560
You have your little veins or
tendons, whatever those are,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.850
that's your nail.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.590
So in this situation, when the
current is going in opposite

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.470
direction, the net force is
actually going to be outward

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.610
on this wire.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.170
The net force is outward.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
And then if you don't believe
me, you might want to try it

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.200
yourself, but the force on
current 1 or on wire 1, or

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.830
some length of wire 1, caused
by the magnetic field due to

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.490
current 2, is also going
to be outwards.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.940
So here, if you want to think
about it little bit, or have a

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.540
little bit of intuition, if
the current's going in the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.670
same direction they will
attract, and if currents are

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.630
going in opposite directions
they will repel each other.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.510
So anyway, let's apply
some numbers.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.700
Let's apply some numbers
to this problem.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.670
Let's do it with the opposite
current direction.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.430
So let's say that current 1--
I'm just going to make up some

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.130
numbers-- is 2 amperes.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:05.170
Current 2 is, I don't
know, 3 amperes.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.980
What else do you need to know?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.900
We need to know how far
apart they are.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.170
So let's say that this distance
right here is, I

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.140
don't know, let's
say it's small.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.640
Let's try to get a respectable
number.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.420
Let's say that they're
1 millimeter apart.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.400
But we want everything in our
standard unit, so that all the

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.100
units work out.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.070
So let's convert it to meters.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.390
So that equals 1 times 10
to the minus 3 meters.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.820
So they're pretty close apart.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.220
Now let's figure out the-- well,
let's do the force on

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.260
wire 1 due to current 2.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.220
Just so that we can see that
this is also repelled.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.090
So let's say that the length in
question, L1, is equal to--

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.170
I don't know, let's make it
a long wire-- 10 meters.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.630
All right.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.830
So how do we do this?

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.710
So first let's figure out the
magnitude of the magnetic

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.410
field created by I2.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.150
I drew this hand too big,
took up too much space.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.260
So the magnetic field created
by current 2, worried about

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.190
the magnitude of it,
that is equal--.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.560
And we saw before, we're
assuming that these

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.040
are-- it's in air.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.190
So we can use the permeability
of a vacuum.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.720
So it's equal to that
constant, the

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.630
permeability of a vacuum.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.150
Times I2.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.580
Just a magnitude.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.080
Now remember we figure out
the direction by wrapping

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.900
our hand around it.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:35.900
We'll do that in a second.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.720
Divided by 2 pi times
the radius.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.980
So 2 pi radius.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.230
So let's see.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.270
So the magnitude of the magnetic
field is equal to--

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.560
well, we'll just keep that
that-- I2, I said is 3

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.620
amperes-- times 3 amperes
divided by 2 pi times 1 times

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.466
10 to the minus 3.

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:10.220
And let's see, that answer
will be in teslas.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.300
All right.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.380
There, we already have the

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.140
permeability of a vacuum there.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.090
So let's write that down.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:29.160
Permeability of a vacuum times 3
divided by 2 second pi times

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.390
1E minus 3.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.490
And I get-- the answer will be
in teslas-- 6E minus 4 teslas.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.560
So the magnitude of the magnetic
field there created

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.240
by current 2 is equal
to 6 times 10

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.430
to the minus 4 teslas.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.170
Now what's the direction
of that magnetic field?

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.640
So here we use our
wrap around rule.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.200
Take your right hand, wrap
it around the wire in the

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.370
direction of the current, and
then you'll get the shape of

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.260
the magnetic field.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.630
So I took my right hand,
my thumb goes in the

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.940
shape of the current.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.420
My hand is going to look E like
this, and my knuckles.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.630
The fingers are going to
come out on that end.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.660
So the magnetic field caused by
current 2 is going to look

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.000
something like that.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.970
So on this side of the wire,
where it intersects with the

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.070
plane, it'll be popping out.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.050
And on this side, it'll
be popping in.

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.850
Fair enough.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.280
So now we can figure out
what the net force on

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.120
this first wire is.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.390
Let me erase some of
this, just so I

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.165
have some free space.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.270
Let's see.

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.410
We already used the 3 amperes,
we already used all of that.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.930
We already used all
of that, in fact.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.080
We just need to know that this
magnetic field, that's popping

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.460
out of the page, we just need
to know its magnitude.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.940
We actually could even get rid
of this whole drawing, because

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.030
now we just know that this has
created a magnetic field.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.160
And now we just worry
about the magnetic

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.110
field and this wire.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.610
But anyway, I'll leave it there,
just so we remember

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.560
what the whole problem was.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.750
So what's the net
force on wire 1?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.080
The net force on wire 1-- so we
could say caused by wire 2

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:16.080
on wire 1, is equal to the
current in wire 1-- so that's

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.270
2 amperes-- times the vector--
well, this is L1.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.130
I'll write L1 right now.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.935
Cross the magnetic field.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:33.909
And really, we just worry
about the magnitude.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.549
Because the direction, we can
figure out what the right--

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.380
well, let's figure out the
direction, first of all.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.320
So L1 is going upwards.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.659
So that's the direction
of our index finger.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:43.520
B is going into the page.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.500
This is B2.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.460
That's the magnetic field
created by this wire.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.740
So it's going into the page.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.570
So if we use the right hand
rule, what happens?

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.465
My index finger is going in the
direction of the current,

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:54.320
in the direction of I1.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.600
My middle finger is pointed
downwards, so you can't see

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.410
it's pointing into the page.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.350
And my other two fingers do
what they need to do.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.570
And so my thumb will
point in the

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.510
direction of the net force.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.130
That's the top of my hand.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.560
So the net force is
in that direction.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.230
So we don't have to worry about
the vectors too much

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.270
anymore, because
we know the end

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.280
direction of the net force.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.270
So what's the magnitude?

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:24.100
So the magnitude of the force
is equal to the current-- 2

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:31.740
amperes-- times the magnitude
of the distance-- times 10

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.140
meters-- times the magnitude
of the magnetic field.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.880
That's 6 times 10 to
the minus 4 teslas.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.530
And then when you take the cross
product, you take the

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.090
sine of the theta between
these two vectors.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.920
But they're perpendicular.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.020
The magnetic field is going
into the page while the

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.310
direction vector of the wire,
the length of the wire, is

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.120
going along the page.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.895
So they are perpendicular.

00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:55.970
So the sine of theta just
comes out to be 1.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.120
So when things are perpendicular
you don't even

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.310
have to worry about
that sine theta.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.060
You can almost just multiply
the terms and then use your

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.860
right hand rule for
the direction.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:09.180
So anyway, this gives us 20
times 6-- 120 times 10

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.560
to the minus 4.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:16.460
That's the same thing as 1.2
times 10 to the minus 2.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.020
So the magnitude of the force
is 1.2 force from

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.640
current 2 on wire 1.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:27.340
The magnitude is 1.2 times 10
to the minus 2 Newtons.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.970
Because we used all
the right units.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.830
And the direction is outward.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.860
And so if we knew the mass of
this, we would-- you know, you

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.000
just divide the force by the
mass, and you would know how

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.860
fast it's accelerating at
that moment outwards.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.380
Of course, as it gets further
and further away, the magnetic

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.630
field is going to get weaker,
so the net force is going to

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.010
get weaker.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.150
So it'll start accelerating at
a slower and slower speed.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.410
Sorry.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.395
At a slower and slower rate.

00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:53.080
But of course, you're
still accelerating.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.580
So you are going to
continue to move

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.330
away faster and faster.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.030
Anyway, all out of time.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.280
See you in the next video.
