00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.890
I'm sure many of y'all have
already heard of the molecule

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.980
DNA, and it stands for
deoxyribonucleic acid.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.610
I wrote it out ahead of time
to spare you the pain of

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.740
watching me spell this
in real time.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860
But it is-- and I think you
already have an idea.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.170
This is the basic unit of
heredity, or it's what codes

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.790
all of our genetic
information.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.770
And what I want to do in this
video-- because I think that's

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.910
kind of common knowledge.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.240
That's popular knowledge that,
oh, everything that makes my

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.640
hair black or my eyes blue or
whatever, that's all somehow

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.330
encoded in our DNA.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.490
But what I want to do in this
video is give you an idea of

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.020
how something like DNA, a
molecule, can actually code

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.500
for what we are.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.390
How does the information, one,
get stored in this type of a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240
molecule, then how does that
actually turn into the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.600
proteins that make up our
enzymes and our organs and our

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
brain cells and everything else
that really make us us?

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.400
So this is a computer graphics
representation of DNA, and I'm

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.860
sure many of y'all have heard
of the double helix.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450
And that's in reference to the
structure that DNA takes.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.860
And you can see here it's
a double helix.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.560
As you can see here, you have
two of these lines, and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.450
they're intertwined
with each other.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.550
You see there, that's one of
them, and then you see another

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.760
one intertwined like that.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.190
And then they're connected by--
you can almost view it as

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.780
like these bridges between the
two helixes, and they twist

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.580
around each other.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.670
I think you get the idea.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.950
So the double helix just
describes the structure, the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.710
shape that DNA takes, and
it leads to all sorts of

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.800
interesting repercussions in
terms of how heredity takes

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.330
place and how natural selection
and variation might

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.340
take place as well.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.860
And actually, in the future, I
do want to actually read with

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.350
you Watson and Crick's paper on
the double helix where they

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.830
essentially talk about
their discovery.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.669
The best thing about that paper,
besides the fact that

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.120
it was probably one of the
biggest discoveries in the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.370
history of mankind, is that the
paper is only a page and a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.950
half long, and it goes to my
general view that if you have

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.440
something good to say,
it shouldn't take you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.510
that long to say it.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.880
But with that said, let's think
a little bit about how

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
this can actually generate the
proteins and whatever else

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.240
that make up all of us.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.290
So right here this is a
zoomed-up version of that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.140
graphic that I just showed you a
little bit earlier, and this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.620
is each of the helixes.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.740
So if this is the magenta side,
if you unwound this

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.530
helix-- right now it shows it
in its wound state, but if I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.010
unwind this helix, one side
would maybe be this magenta

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.350
side of our helix and
then one side is

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.880
this green side, right?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.400
And if you twist it up,
you get back to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.110
this drawing up here.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.650
And then these bridges that you
see in this drawing in the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.870
double helix, those are these
connections right here.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.120
These are the bridges.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.410
Now, what allows us to code
information is that the blocks

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.030
that make up the bridges are
made of different molecules.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.250
And the four different molecules
that are made up in

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.670
DNA are adenine-- and
it's written here

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.390
on this little chart.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.370
I got all of this from
Wikipedia, so if you want more

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.310
information I encourage
you to go there.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.200
Adenine, that's up here.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.240
This is the molecular structure
of adenine.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.270
It's connected to a sugar
right here, ribose.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.900
I won't go into a deoxyribose.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.600
And then you have your
phosphate group.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.840
But these kind of form the
backbone of the DNA: the sugar

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.770
and the phosphate groups.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.420
And I'm not going to go into
the microbiology of it,

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.090
because that's not important
right now to understanding

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.770
just how does this intuitively
code for what we are.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.620
So along the backbone, which
is identical, and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.240
we'll talk about it.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.550
They run in different
directions.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.960
It's called antiparallel,
so they label the ends.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.500
And I'm not going to go into
detail there, but the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.540
important thing are
these bases here.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:26.180
So you have adenine, and adenine
pairs with thymine,

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.635
and you see that up here.

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:31.470
If you have an adenine molecule
here, an adenine base

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.550
here, it'll pair with
thymine, and this is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.590
called the base pair.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.500
Adenine and thymine pair
with each other.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.470
If you have thymine, it's going
to pair with adenine.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.790
And then you have guanine and
it pairs with cytosine.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.480
And the names of these, you
should know these names, just

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.200
because they are almost-- well,
if you ever enter any

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.550
discussion about DNA
and base pairs,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.310
this is expected knowledge.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.250
But the names of the molecules
and how they're structured,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.840
not important just yet.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.290
But what's important is the fact
that there are four of

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.070
them and that they essentially
code information.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.560
So you can view one of these
strands in kind of a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.410
simplified way.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.280
You can just view it as a strand
of-- so this one, if it

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:24.600
has an adenine and then
it has a cytosine,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.370
then it has a guanine.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.050
That's a guanine.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.290
They did it in purple.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.050
And then it has a-- oh, no, it
has a thymine, not a guanine.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.090
So it has a thymine in
purple, and then in

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.160
blue, it has a guanine.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.870
So this strand right
here codes ACTG.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.470
And if you were to code the
opposite side of the strand,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.780
you could immediately-- I don't
even have to look here.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.550
I can look at this side and
say, OK, adenine will pair

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:58.050
with thymine, cytosine pairs
with guanine, thymine pairs

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.340
with adenine, and guanine
pairs with cytosine.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.530
So they're complementary
strands.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.980
So if you think about
it, they're really

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.540
coding the same thing.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.980
If you have one of them, you
have all of the information

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.820
for the other.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.820
Now, in our DNA, in a human's
DNA, you might say, hey, Sal,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.120
how do I go from these little
chains of these molecules?

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.750
How does that turn into me?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.090
How does that turn into
this complex organism?

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.520
And the simple answer is, well,
the human genome has

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.505
three billion of these
base pairs.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.230
And that's actually just in
half of your chromosomes.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.040
And I'll tell you, maybe in this
video or a future video,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.540
why we only consider half of
your chromosomes, and that's

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.150
because essentially you have
a pair of every chromosome.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.180
I'll talk in more detail
about that.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.890
And this number, to some people,
they might say, it

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:04.420
only takes three billion base
pairs to describe who I am?

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.260
And some people would say, wow,
it takes three billion

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.490
base pairs to describe
who I am.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.060
I never thought I was
that complex.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.390
So depending on your point of
view, this is either a large

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.560
or small number.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.810
But when you take these three
billion base pairs, you're

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.900
actually encoding all of the
information that it takes to

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.560
make in this case
a human being.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.330
And actually it turns out a
lot of primates don't have

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.450
that many different base pairs
than human beings.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.790
The amazing thing is even things
like roundworms and

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:38.000
fruit flies also number in a
surprisingly large fraction of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.600
the base pairs of
a human being.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.680
Maybe I'll do another
video where I go

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.720
into comparative biology.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.370
But how do these base pairs
actually lead to proteins?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.530
I mean, it's fair enough.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.470
That's information.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.100
It's like you can view these
as ones and zeroes in some

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.690
type of computer language, but
really they're not just ones

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.140
and zeroes, because they can
take on four different values.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.860
They can take on an A, a T, a
C or a G, so you could think

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.930
of them as zero, ones, twos
and threes, but I won't go

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.840
into that whole aspect
of it just now.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.340
So how does that actually
code information?

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:17.690
So DNA when it actually
transcribes something-- the

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:24.345
process is called transcription,
and I'm going

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:27.000
to do a pretty gross
simplification of it, but I

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.450
think it'll give you the gist of
how it codes for proteins.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.480
So what happens when
transcription happens is that

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.980
these two strands split up, and
one of the strands-- let

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.890
me just take one of them.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:37.830
Let's say it looks like this.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.580
I'll do it all in one color.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:47.930
Let's say it's just ATGGACG--
I'm just making up stuff-- TA.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.790
Let's say that that's the strand
that got split up.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.080
And what happens is
it transcribes--

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.060
and I won't say itself.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.310
There's a whole bunch of enzymes
and proteins and a

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.060
whole bunch of chemical
reactions that have to happen,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.050
but this DNA essentially
transcribes a

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.020
complementary mRNA.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.260
And I'll introduce RNA.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.930
It's essentially the exact same
thing as-- well, the word

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.630
is ribonucleic acid, so it's
literally-- you get rid of the

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:24.640
deoxy, so you can kind of say
it's got its oxy, and it's

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.000
ribonucleic acid, but it's
very similar to DNA.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.960
It codes in the exact
same way.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:37.260
The only difference between RNA,
instead of a thymine, it

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.750
has something called a uracil.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.760
So every place where you would
have expected a thymine, you

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.520
would have expected a T,
you'll now see a U.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.260
So, for example, if this is the
DNA strand, then an RNA,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.520
an mRNA, in a messenger RNA
strand, will be built

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.780
complementary to this.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.070
So it'll be built-- let's see.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.310
With A, you'd normally have
thymine when you're talking

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.180
DNA, but now we're talking RNA,
so it'll be a uracil,

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.260
then an adenine, cytosine,
cytosine, uracil, then we got

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.070
a guanine, a cytosine,
an adenine, and then

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:14.770
we'll have a uracil.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.230
So this is the mRNA
strand here.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.820
And all of this is occurring
inside the

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.500
nucleus of your cells.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.670
And we'll do a whole series of
videos in the future about the

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.995
structure of our cells, but I
think most of us know that our

00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:34.910
cells-- and I'll talk more
about eukaryotic and

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.220
prokaryotic organisms in the
future, but most complex

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.860
organisms, they have a cell
nucleus where we have all of

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.540
our chromosomes that contain
all of our DNA.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.690
And so this mRNA then detaches
itself from the DNA that it

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.400
was transcribed from, and then
it leaves the nucleus, and it

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.950
goes to these structures
called ribosomes.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.360
I'm oversimplifying it a
little bit, but at the

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.510
ribosomes, this mRNA is
translated into proteins.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.450
So let me do that.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.360
So let's say this is the mRNA.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.780
It was transcribed from that
DNA, so let me get

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.320
rid of that DNA now.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.300
I got rid of the DNA.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.990
This is the mRNA that we were
able to transcribe from that

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.220
DNA, and they have these
other things called

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.600
tRNA or transfer RNA.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.230
And what these are--
and this is the

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.930
really interesting part.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:28.230
So you may or may not know that
pretty much everything we

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.200
are is made up of proteins.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.610
And these proteins, the building
blocks of proteins

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.790
are amino acids.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.380
And for those of you who like
to lift weights, I'm sure

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.120
you've seen ads for amino
acid supplements and

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.640
things of the like.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.420
And the reason why they talk
about amino acids is because

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.400
those are the building
blocks of proteins.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.200
My son actually has an allergy
to milk protein, so we had to

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.690
get him a formula that was just
pure amino acids, just

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.520
all of the milk proteins
broken down.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:04.260
So if you look at a protein,
it's actually a chain of these

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.240
amino acids and usually
a fairly long chain.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.750
We'll look at some protein
structures in the very near

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.090
future, just to give you
an idea of things.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.550
It's a very long chain of these
amino acids, and there

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.700
are actually 20 different
amino acids.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.760
Twenty different amino acids are
pretty much the structure

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.990
of all of our proteins.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.240
Let me write that.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.070
So a very obvious question is
how can these things code for

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.050
20 different amino acids?

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:40.370
I can only have four different
things in this little bucket

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.410
right here.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.880
And then you just have to go
back to your combinatorics, or

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.510
if you can't go back to it
to watch the playlist on

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.290
probability and combinatorics,
and say, OK, there's only four

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:56.090
ways that I can have for
each of these bases.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:58.600
There's only four different
bases that I can have here,

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.540
either an adenine guanine,
cytosine or, depending on

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.770
whether we're talking
about DNA or RNA,

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.980
a uracil or a thymine.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.810
But how can we increase
the combinations?

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.450
Well, if we include two of them,
if we include two bases,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.350
then how many combinations
can we have?

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.260
Well, we have four possibilities
here, then we'd

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.190
have four possibilities here, so
we'd have 16 possibilities.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.850
But that's still not enough.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.800
That's still not enough to code
for one of 20 amino acids

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.080
to say, hey, this is going to
code for amino acid number

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.950
five, and we'll talk more about
their actual names.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:34.820
So what do we have to do?

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.740
Well, we have to use
three of them.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.040
So three of them, there's
actually four times four times

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.020
four possibilities here, so
they could code for 64

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.610
different things.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.170
They could take on 64 different
combinations or

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.670
permutations, this
UAC right here.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.990
So if we have three of these
bases, we can actually code

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.400
for an amino acid.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.580
Actually, it's overkill, because
we can actually have

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.510
64 combinations here, and there
are only 20 amino acids,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.410
so we can even have redundant
combinations code for

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.470
different amino acids.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:11.210
For example, we might say
that, and this isn't the

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.350
actual code, but maybe UAC, and
I should look these up.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.020
This codes for amino
acid number 1.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:24.730
And if it was AAU, then this
codes for amino acid number 2.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:29.430
And if I have-- I mean, I
think you get the idea.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:35.110
If I have GGG, this codes for
amino acid number 10.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:38.490
And what happens is when this
messenger RNA leaves the

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.330
nucleus, it goes to the
ribosomes, and at the

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.620
ribosomes-- we're going to look
at that diagram in a few

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.470
seconds-- but at the ribosomes--
let me take my

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.940
same mRNA molecule.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.570
And they're much longer than
what I'm showing here.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.700
This is just a fraction
of an mRNA molecule.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.700
So I'll take my mRNA molecule,
and what they do is they

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.630
essentially act as a template
for tRNA molecules.

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:12.270
And tRNA molecules are these
molecules that are attached to

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.310
the-- they're almost like the
trucks for the amino acids.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.610
So let's say I have some amino
acid right here, and then I

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.370
have another amino acid that's
right here like that, and then

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.110
I have another amino acid
that's like that.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.300
They'll be attached
to tRNA molecules.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:33.880
So let's say that this tRNA
molecule has on it-- so this

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.380
amino acid is attached to a
tRNA molecule that has the

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:42.570
code on it A-- let me do
it in a darker color.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.415
It has the code AUG.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:56.900
This one right here has
the code-- let me

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.650
pick another one.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:58.900
Let's say it has GGAC.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.290
So what's going to happen?

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.210
When you're in the ribosome, and
it's a complex situation,

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.750
but actually what's happening
isn't too fancy.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:14.380
This tRNA, it wants to bond
to this part of the mRNA.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:14.840
Why?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.670
Because adenine bonds with
uracil, uracil bonds with

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.940
adenine, and guanine bonds with
cyotsine, so it'll pull

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.930
up right here.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.970
It'll pull up right next to this
thing, and actually, I

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.920
should probably-- well, I don't
know if I can rotate it.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.530
But it'll just pull up
right here and attach

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.800
to this mRNA molecule.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.060
And this right here is tRNA.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.450
This is mRNA.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.410
And the names don't matter.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.510
I really just want to give you
the big picture idea of how

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.490
the proteins are actually
formed.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.960
And this is an amino acid.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.600
I don't know, let's call it
amino acid 1, amino acid 5,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.090
amino acid 20.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.670
This guy, he's going to
pull up right here.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.530
The guanine is attracted to the
cytosine, and if you watch

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.740
the chemistry videos, these are
actually hydrogen bonds

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.410
that form the base pairs.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.380
Adenine, wants to pull up to
uracil, cytosine to guanine,

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.579
and so on and so forth.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.430
And so once all of these
guys have pulled

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:09.970
up-- let me do that.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.030
So once you've pulled up, let's
say that this is-- I

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.740
could do it up here.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.720
This is my mRNA molecule.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.180
I'm not going to draw the
specifics right there.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:24.339
My little tRNA's pull up, pull
up next to it, and they each

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.470
hold a payload, right?

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.250
So this first one holds this
payload right here of this

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.230
amino acid.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.840
The second one holds this
payload of this amino acid and

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.800
so forth and so on.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.030
And so it might keep going,
and there's another green

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:40.870
amino acid here.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.230
They really don't have those
colors, but I'm just-- just

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.300
for the sake of simplicity
like that.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.880
And then the amino acids bond
to each other when they're

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.600
held like that close
to each other.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.360
This doesn't happen
all by itself.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.860
The ribosome serves a purpose,
and there are enzymes that

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.210
facilitate this process, but
once these guys bond together,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.160
the tRNA detaches,
and you have this

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.330
chain of amino acids.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.590
And then the chain of amino
acids starts to bend around so

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.910
they have all of these-- and
it's actually a fascinating--

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.920
I mean, people spend their lives
studying how proteins

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.680
fold, and that's actually where
they get most of their

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.770
structural properties.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.030
It's not just the chain of the
amino acids, but what's more

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.660
important is how these amino
acids actually fold.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.880
So once you fold them, they form
these really ultracomplex

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.990
patterns based on what amino
acid is attracted to what

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.180
other amino acid in these
very intricate

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.820
three-dimensional shapes.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.250
And what I took here from
Wikipedia is these are some

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:38.920
amino acids.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:44.150
And just to be able to relate
this to the DNA, this right

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.220
here is insulin.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.850
It's key in our ability to
process glucose in our body.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.300
So this right here is insulin.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.430
It's a hormone.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:54.970
So sometimes you hear people
talk about your immune system.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.110
Sometimes you hear people
talking about your endocrine

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.200
system and hormones, sometimes
your digestive system.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.700
This is hemoglobin, what
essentially transports our

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.090
oxygen in our blood.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.020
But all of these things are
proteins, and all these

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.510
little, little folds you see,
these are all little amino-- I

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.520
mean, they're just little
dots of amino acids.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.810
Some of these are multiple
chains of amino acids kind of

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.250
fitting together like a big
puzzle, but some of them or

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.950
just single chains
of amino acids.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.310
For insulin right here, this
is 50 amino acids.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.850
And then once the chain forms,
it all bundles together and

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.710
forms this little blob like you
see, but the shape of that

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.350
blob is super important for
insulin being able to perform

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.870
the function that it needs to
perform in our systems.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:47.040
But this right here is
approximately 50-- I forgot

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.145
the exact number--
amino acids.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:59.670
This right here, this
immunoglobulin G, which is

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.760
part of our immune
system, this is

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:09.700
roughly 1,500 amino acids.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.160
So how much DNA or how
many base pairs

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:12.990
had to code for this?

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.180
Well, three times
as much, right?

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.350
Because you have to have three
base pairs that code for one

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.490
amino acid, and actually, three
base pairs, this is

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:27.180
called a codon, because it
codes for amino acids.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.380
So three base pairs
make a codon.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.170
So if you have 50 amino acids
that make up insulin, that

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.230
means you're going to have to
have 50 codons, which means

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:39.940
you have to have 150 bases
or 150 of these

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.770
A's and G's and T's.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.100
If you have 1,500 amino acids,
that means you're going to

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.420
have to have 1,500 codons, which
means you're going to

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:54.660
have roughly 4,500 of these base
pairs that code for it.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:59.280
Now, there are some notions that
get confused a lot, so I

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.480
went to kind of the smallest
level of our DNA right here,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.180
and this is the level at which--
well, this is RNA that

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.300
I'm pointing to right there, but
this is the smallest level

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.580
of DNA, and that's the level
at which the information is

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.320
actually coded.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.490
But how does that relate to
things like genes and

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.700
chromosomes and things
that you might talk

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.183
about in other contexts?

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.880
So let's say the 150 base pairs
that coded for insulin,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.515
these make up a gene.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.450
And these 4,500 base pairs
make up another gene.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:40.070
Now, all of the genes don't make
proteins, but all of the

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.720
proteins are made by genes.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.940
So let's say I have just a
bunch of-- I'll just make

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:51.770
another A, G, and it goes down,
down, down, and you have

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.920
a T and then a C and a
C, and let's say I

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.840
have 4,500 of these.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.480
These could code
for a protein.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.320
These could code for protein,
or they could have all of

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.480
these other kind of regulatory
functions telling what other

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.400
parts of the DNA should and
should not be coded and how

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.870
the DNA behaves, so it becomes
super, super complex.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.050
But this kind of section of our
DNA, this is what we refer

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:24.400
to as a gene, and a gene can
have anywhere from a couple of

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.990
hundreds of these base pairs
or these bases to several

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.860
thousand of these base pairs.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.220
Now, a gene is that part of our
chromosome that codes for

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.920
a particular protein or serves
a certain function.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.285
Now, there are different
versions of genes.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.580
It's a gross oversimplification,
but let me

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.815
say this is the gene
for insulin.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.650
Now, there might be slight
variations in how insulin can

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.880
be coded for, and I'm kind of
going out of my domain right

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.870
here, because I don't
know if that's true.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.580
And maybe I shouldn't just
speak specifically about

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.860
insulin, but it's coding for
some protein, but there's

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.990
maybe multiple different
ways that that

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.470
protein can be coded.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.540
Maybe instead of a T here,
sometimes there's a C there.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.000
It still codes for
the same protein.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.330
It doesn't change it quite
enough, but that protein acts

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.730
just a little bit different.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.420
It's a slight variant.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:21.750
I'll use that word.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.850
Now, each variant of this gene
is called an allele.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:34.845
It's a specific variant
of your gene.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:45.230
Now, if you take this DNA chain,
and this chain over

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.840
here-- let's see.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.910
This is one base pair.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.000
This might be like one base.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.200
This is another base.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.430
Maybe this is an adenine and
then this would be a thymine

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.900
over here in green.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.220
This is an adenine and this
would be a thymine.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.570
If right here this is a guanine,
then right here would

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:03.710
be a cytosine.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:05.610
This would be just a
very small section.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:10.800
If I were to like zoom out, and
let's say we have a big

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.180
chain of DNA where each of these
little dots are a base

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:19.510
pair that I'm drawing here,
maybe this section

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.310
codes for gene 1.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:25.630
And then there's some noise or
things that we haven't fully

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.120
understood yet.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:26.940
Now, I want to be clear.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.790
Just with a simple discussion of
DNA, we're already kind of

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.110
approaching the frontiers of
what we know and what we don't

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.890
know, because DNA is hugely
complex, and there's all of

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.300
these feedback structures, and
certain genes tell you to code

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.600
for other genes and not to code
for other genes and to

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.250
code under certain
circumstances, hugely complex.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.050
So there's huge sections of
DNA that we still don't

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.990
understand what exactly
they do.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.930
But then maybe they'll have
another section here that

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.470
codes for gene 2.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.570
Maybe gene 2 is a little
bit longer.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.510
Maybe it's 1,000 base pairs.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:00.380
But when you take all of these
and you turn it into a-- it

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.990
kind of winds in on
itself like this.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.610
Let me do it.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.980
So it'll wind up, winding in on
itself like this and do all

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.440
sorts of crazy things.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.880
Remember, it completely bundles
itself up, and then it

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.300
looks something like that.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.800
Then you get a chromosome.

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.620
And just to get an idea of how
large a chromosome is compared

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:29.090
to the actual base pairs,
chromosome number one in the

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.600
human genome-- so we
have 23 pairs.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.140
If you look at it inside of a
nucleus-- so let's say that's

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.620
the nucleus.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.720
Let's say this is the cell.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.960
The cell is much bigger
than what I'm showing.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.925
But we have 23 pairs
of chromosomes.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.620
I won't do all of them.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.280
You can actually see
chromosomes in a

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.290
not-too-expensive microscope, so
we're already getting to a

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.580
scale that we can start
to look at.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.200
But the largest chromosome,
which is chromosome number one

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.370
in the human genome, just to
give an idea of how much

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.760
information it's packing, that
thing right there has 220

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.640
million base pairs.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.960
Sometimes people talk about
chromosomes and genetics and

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.070
genes and base pairs
interchangeably, but it's very

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.730
important to kind of get
an idea of scale.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:15.910
These chromosomes are a
super-long strand of DNA

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.850
that's all configured and
bundled up, and it contains

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:21.060
220 million base pairs.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.920
So the actual elements that are
coding for the information

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.530
are unbelievably small
relative to

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.150
the chromosome itself.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.260
But now that we understand a
little bit, and actually I

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.490
want to take a look back at
this, because this kind of

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.960
blows my mind, that if you
just take those little

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.370
combinations of those amino
acids, you can form these very

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.890
intricate, very advanced
structures that we're still

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.500
fully understanding how they
actually interact with each

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.155
other and regulate how all of
our biological processes work.

00:26:51.155 --> 00:26:54.850
And what's even more amazing is
that this scheme that I've

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:58.340
talked about in this video about
DNA to mRNA to tRNA to

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.580
these molecules, this is true
for all of life on our planet,

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.580
so we all share this
same mechanism.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.930
Me and this plant, we share
that common root

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.340
that we all have DNA.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.580
As different as me and that
roach that I might not like to

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.240
be in the same room, we all
share that same common root of

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.880
DNA and that all of it codes to
proteins in this exact same

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.440
way, that there's this
commonality amongst all life.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.700
That, to me, is mind blowing.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.970
Then even more mind blowing is
how these very complex shapes

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.360
are formed by the DNA.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.860
And this isn't speculation.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.710
This is observed behavior.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.800
This is a fascinating structure
right here, but it's

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.060
just based on 20 amino acid--
you can almost view the amino

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.500
acid as the LEGOS, and you put
the LEGOS together, and just

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.890
the chemical interactions form
these fairly impressive

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.090
structures right here.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:55.460
So now that we know a little bit
about DNA and how it codes

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.400
into protein, we can take a
little jump back and talk a

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.480
little bit more about how
variation is actually

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.210
introduced into a population.
