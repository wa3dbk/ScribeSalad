00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's do some more
limit examples.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.250
So let's get another problem.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:19.860
If I had the limit as x
approaches 3 of, let's say,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:31.190
x squared minus 6x plus 9
over x squared minus 9.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.450
So the first thing I like to do
whenever I see any of these

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.150
limits problems is just
substitute the number in and

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.413
see if I get something
that makes sense, and

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:37.670
then we'd be done.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.170
Well, usually we'd be done.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.490
I don't want to make these
sweeping statements.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.880
If the function is
continuous, we'd be done.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.250
But if we put the 3 in the
numerator, we get 3 squared,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.040
which is 9, minus 18 plus 9.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.660
So that equals 0.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.510
And the denominator also--
let's see, 3 squared minus

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.400
9, that also equals 0.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.970
So we don't like having 0/0.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.840
My pen tool is
malfunctioning again.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
So we don't like getting 0, 0,
0, so is there any way we can

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.010
simplify this expression to
maybe get it to an expression

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.110
that, when we evaluate it at x
equals 3, we actually get

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.640
something that makes sense?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.180
Well, whenever I see two of
these polynomials here, and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.220
they look, just by inspecting
them, relatively easy to

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
factor, I like to factor them
out because maybe there's the

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.250
same factor in the numerator
and the denominator, and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.610
then we can simplify it.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.110
So let's say that this is the
same thing as-- that looks

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.690
like it's x plus 3--
no, no, no, x minus 3.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.450
This is x minus 3.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.280
It actually looks like it's x
minus 3 squared, but we're

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.840
just going to write x minus 3
times x minus 3, which is, of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.820
course, x minus 3 squared.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.940
And then in the denominator,
you know how to factor these,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:01.310
this is x plus 3 times
x minus 3, all right?

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.990
So the limit as x approaches 3
of this expression is the same

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.960
thing as the limit as
x approaches 3 of

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.760
this expression.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.660
And, of course, there's nothing
we can do to change the fact

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.150
that this function, or this
expression, is undefined

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.360
at x equals 3.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.500
But if we can simplify
it, we can figure out

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.320
what it approaches.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.010
Well, if we assume that x is
any number but 3, we can cross

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.330
out these two terms because
then they wouldn't be 0, right?

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.020
It only is 0 when x is equal to
3 because-- so in the numerator

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.990
and the denominator, we
can cross this out.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.250
And we can say-- and I'm not
being very rigorous here, but

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.610
this is kind of how it's
taught, and I think you get the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.180
intuition-- that this is the
same thing as the limit as x

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.200
approaches 3 of x minus
3 over x plus 3.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.330
Now let's just try to stick
the x in and see what we get.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.010
Well, in the numerator,
we get 3 minus 3.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.030
We still get 0.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.190
But in the denominator
here, we get 6, right?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.520
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.770
So now we get a good number.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.680
0 or 6, well, that's a
real number, so it's 0.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.710
0/6 is 0.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.170
So that was interesting.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.660
The first time we did it,
we got the answer 0/0.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.760
And now we get the answer
0 by simplifying.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.590
But, of course, it's very
important to remember that

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.810
this expression is not
defined at x equals 3.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.280
It's defined everywhere but,
but if we were to graph it, and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.070
I encourage you to do so, you
would see that as you get

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.980
closer and closer to x
equals 3, the value of this

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.960
expression will equal 0.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.060
And I know what
you're thinking.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.350
Well, this was 0/0.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.190
Is every time I get 0/0 going
to end up just becoming 0 when

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.300
I evaluate the expression?

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.240
Well, let's explore that.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.570
Let me clear this.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:56.080
Let's say what is-- pen is not
working-- the limit as x

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:17.860
approaches 1 of x squared
minus x minus 2.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.640
No, let's say x squared
plus x minus 2.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.110
As you can see, I do all
this in my head, and

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.450
I'm prone to mistakes.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.370
And all of that over x minus 1.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.940
Well, once again, if we just
evaluate it, let's see what

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.930
happens when x equals 1.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.200
You get 1 squared plus
1, so it's 2 minus 2.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.010
You get 0/0.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.640
So once again, we get 0/0, and
we have to do something to

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.960
this maybe to simplify it.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.620
Well, let's factor the top.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.530
So that's the same thing as
the limit as x approaches 1.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.450
Well, that's x minus 1
times x plus 2, right?

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.840
And I think you'll often
discover when you see a lot of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.720
limit problems that even if
this top factor, if this top

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.710
expression, is hard to factor,
chances are, one of the things

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.390
in the denominator that are
making this expression

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.770
undefined is probably
a factor up here.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.390
So sometimes you might get a
more complex thing that isn't

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.510
as easy to factor as this, but
a good starting point is to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.840
guess that one of the factors
is going to be in the bottom

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.360
expression because that's kind
of the trick of these problems,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.750
to just simplify
the expression.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.390
So once again, if we assume
that x does not equal 1, and

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.440
this expression would not be
0 and this would not be 0,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.230
then these two could
be canceled out.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.010
And we get that this is just
the same thing as the limit as

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.070
x approaches 1 of x plus 2.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.030
Well, now this is pretty easy.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.850
What's the limit as x
approaches 1 of x plus 2?

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.180
Well, you just stick 1 in
there, and you get 3.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.010
So it's interesting.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.840
When we just tried to
evaluate the expression at

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.580
x equals 1, we got 0/0.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.840
And in the previous example, we
saw that it evaluated out when

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.870
you simplified it to 0, and in
this example, it came out to 3.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.760
And I really encourage you, if
you have a graphing calculator,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.110
graph these functions that
we're doing and see and show

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.080
yourself visually that it's
true, that the limit as you

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.190
approach, say, x equals 1
actually does approach the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.950
limits that were solving for.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.600
And make up your own problems.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.940
Hell, that's what I'm doing.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.650
So you could prove
it to yourself.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.320
So let's do another.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.280
Let's do one that I think
is pretty interesting.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:57.770
Let's say what's the limit
as x approaches infinity?

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:04.300
The limit as x approaches
infinity of, let's say, x

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:17.650
squared plus 3 over
x to the third.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.960
So the way I think about these
problems as they approach

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.910
infinity, just think about what
happens when you get

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.960
really, really, really
large values of x.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.030
And kind of a cheating way of
doing this is, if you have a

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.840
calculator, even if you don't
have a calculator, put

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.120
in huge numbers here.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.610
See what happens when x is a
million, see what happens when

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.900
x is a billion, see what
happens when x is a trillion,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.030
and I think you'll
get the point.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.270
You'll see what-- if there
is a limit here, you'll

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.500
see what it's going to.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.090
But the way I think about it
is, in the numerator, kind of

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.180
the fastest-growing term here
is the x squared term, right?

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.970
This is the fastest-growing
term here.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.820
In the denominator, what's
the fastest-growing term?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.475
Well, in the denominator,
the fastest-growing term

00:07:54.475 --> 00:07:56.440
is this x to the third.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.160
Well, what's going to
grow faster, x to the

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.000
third or x squared?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.840
Well, yeah, x to the third's
going to grow a lot

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.130
faster than x squared.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.310
So this denominator, as you get
larger and larger and larger

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.230
values of x, is going to grow a
lot faster than that numerator.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.700
So you could imagine if the
denominator's growing much,

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.905
much, much faster than the
numerator, as you get larger

00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:17.130
and larger numbers, you're
going to get a smaller and

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.630
smaller and smaller
fraction, right?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.280
It's going to approach 0.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.590
And so as you go to
infinity, it approaches 0.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.530
I know that I kind of just
hand waved, but that's really

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.320
how you think about it.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.830
Another way you could do
it is you could actually

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.940
divide this fraction.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.470
You could actually divide this
rational expression, and you'll

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.750
get something like 1/x plus
something, something,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.620
something, and then you'd also
see, oh, well, the limit as x

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.270
approaches infinity
of 1/x is also 0.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.900
Let's do one more.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.190
I'll do this fast so
I can confuse you.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:09:00.490
The limit as x approaches
infinity of 3x squared plus

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.670
x over 4x squared minus 5.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.680
These problems kind of look
confusing sometimes, but

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.480
they're really easy.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.330
You just have to think about
what happens as you get

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.700
really large values of x.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.320
Well, as you get really large
values of x, these small terms,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.670
these ones that don't grow as
fast as these large terms,

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.640
kind of don't matter anymore,
right, because you're getting

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.270
really large values of x.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.210
And this case, these don't
matter anymore, and then

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.210
these two x terms grow
at the same pace, right?

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.070
And they'll always be
kind of growing in

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.000
this ratio of 3 to 4.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.870
So the limit here is
actually that easy.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.880
It's 3/4.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.320
So what you do is you just
figure out what's the

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.940
fastest-growing term on the
top, what's the fastest-growing

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.000
term on the bottom, and then
figure out what it approaches.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.680
If they're the same term, then
they kind of cancel out, and

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.700
you say the limit
approaches 3/4.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.410
