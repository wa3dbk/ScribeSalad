00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:08.298
Multiply (3x+2) by (5x-7). So we are multiplying two binomials. I am actually going to show you

00:00:08.298 --> 00:00:13.600
two really equivalent ways of doing this. One that you might hear in a classroom and it is kind of a more mechanical

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.533
memorizing way of doing it which might be faster but you really don't know what you are doing

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.600
and then there is the one where you are essentially just applying something what you already know

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.933
and kind of a logical way. So I will first do the memorizing way that you might be exposed to and they'll use something called FOIL.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:35.933
So let me write this down here. So you can immediately see that whenever someone gives you

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:41.200
a new mnemonic to memorize, that you are doing something pretty mechanical. So FOIL literally stands for

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:56.733
First Outside, let me write it this way.....F O I L where the F in FOIL stands for First, the O in FOIL stand for Outside,

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:03.800
the I stands for Inside and then the L stands for Last. The reason why I don't like these things

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.067
is that when you are 35 years old, you are not going to remember what FOIL stood for and

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:10.733
then you are not going to remember how to multiply this binomial. But lets just apply FOIL.

00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:20.333
So First says just multiply the first terms in each of these binomials. So just multiply the 3x times the 5x.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:27.800
So (3x. 5x). The Outside part tells us to multiply the outside terms. So in this case, you have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:38.533
3x on the outside and you have -7 on the outside. So that is +3x(-7). The inside,

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:53.800
well the inside terms here are 2 and 5x. So, (+2.5x) and then finally you have the last terms. You have the 2 and the -7.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.867
So the last terms are 2 times -7. 2(-7). So what you are essentially doing is just making sure

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:06.867
that you are multipying each term by every other term here. What we are essentially doing is multiplying,

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:17.267
doing the distributive property twice. We are multiplying the 3x times (5x-7). So 3x times (5x-7) is (3x . 5x) plus (3x - 7).

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:20.933
And we are multiplying the 2 times (5x-7) to give us these terms.

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:28.600
But anyway, lets just multiply these out just to get our answer. 3x times 5x is same thing as (3 times 5) ( x times x)

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.867
which is the same thing as 15x square. You can just do this x to the first time to x to the first.

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:43.533
You multiply the x to get x squared. 3 times 5 is 15. This term right here 3 times -7 is -21

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:51.800
and then you have your x right over here. And then you have this term which is 2 times 5 which is 10 times x. So +10x.

00:02:52.046 --> 00:03:01.267
And then finally you have this term here in blue. 2 times -7 is -14. And we aren't done yet,

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:08.667
we can simplify this a little bit. We have two like terms here. We have this...let me find a new color.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:17.733
We have 2 terms with a x to the first power or just an x term right over here. So we have -21 of something and you add 10

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:24.600
or in another way, you have 10 of something and you subtract 21 of them, you are going to have -11 of that something.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:34.800
We put the other terms here, you have 15... 15x squared and then you have your -14 and we are done.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.000
Now I said I would show you another way to do it. I want to show you why the

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.267
distributive property can get us here without having to memorize FOIL.

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:47.533
So the distributive property tells us that if we 're... look if we are multipying something times an expression, you just have to multiply

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:56.067
times every term in the expression. So we can distribute, we can distribute the 5x onto the 3...,

00:03:56.067 --> 00:04:05.733
or actually we could...well, let me view it this way... we could distribute the 5x-7, this whole thing onto the 3x+2.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:10.200
Let me just change the order since we are used to distributing something from the left.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:19.267
So this is the same thing as (5x-7)(3x+2). I just swapped the two expressions. And we can distribute this whole thing

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:25.667
times each of these terms. Now what happens if I take (5x-7) times 3x? Well, thats just going

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:38.718
to be 3x times (5x-7). So I have just distributed the 5x-7 times 3x and to that I am going to add 2 times 5x-7.

00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:42.138
I have just distributed the 5x-7 onto the 2.

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:46.600
Now, you can do the distributive property again. We can distribute the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.667
3x onto the 5x. We can distribute the 3x onto the 5x.

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:55.400
And we can distribute the 3x onto the -7.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.267
We can distribute the 2 onto the 5x, over here

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:04.267
and we can distribute the 2 on that -7.

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.000
Now if we do it like this what do we get ?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.667
3x times 5x, that's this right over here. If we do 3x times -7, that's this term right over here.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:25.600
If you do 2 times 5x, that's this term right over here. If you do 2 times -7, that is this term right

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.067
over here. So we got the exact same result that we got with FOIL.

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:33.667
Now, FOIL can be faster if you just wanted to do it and kind of skip to this step.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.667
I think its important that you know that this is how it actually works.

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:43.267
Just in case you do forget this when you are 35 or 45 years old and you are faced with multiplying binomial,

00:05:43.267 --> 99:59:59.999
you just have to remember the distributive property.
