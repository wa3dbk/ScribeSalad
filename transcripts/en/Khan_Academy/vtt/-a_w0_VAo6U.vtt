00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.100
For an art project, a pentagon
made of construction paper is

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.180
cut into five equal slices.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.210
Two of the slices are removed.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.540
Write the remaining portion of
the pentagon as a fraction.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.360
So let's draw ourselves
a pentagon.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.060
A pentagon is just a five-sided
figure, so

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.010
it looks like this.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.770
It's also where the Department
of Defense is located, a

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.450
building that's actually
in this shape.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.950
That's why they call
it the Pentagon.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.420
Let me draw it a little
nicer than that.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.050
It looks something like this.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.400
Eh!

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
My pentagon drawing skills
need some work.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.840
There you go.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.990
That's a pretty decent
shot at a pentagon.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.480
So that's the pentagon made
out of construction paper.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.140
Notice it has one, two, three,
four, five sides.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.310
That's why it's called
a pentagon.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.840
And it's cut into five equals
slices, so we could do that.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.560
Maybe that's the center
of the pentagon.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.270
Here this is one slice
right there.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.690
That is two slices, three
slices, four slices, and then

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.070
a fifth slice, so you
can imagine these

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.970
are all equal slices.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.736
Now, they're saying two of
the slices are removed.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.310
So let's get rid of two
of these slices.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.510
Let's say we remove that
slice up there.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.750
Let's say we remove the
slice right next to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.990
it right over there.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.740
And then they want us to write
the remaining portion of the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.990
pentagon as a fraction.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.110
So what are the remaining
slices?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.340
Well, I have this slice right
there, that slice right over

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.390
here and then this slice.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.960
So you have three slices
remaining out of a total

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.610
possible of how many?

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.190
How many slices are in
the entire pentagon?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.870
So if you look at the entire
pentagon, if you consider all

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.630
of the slices, we have
five slices.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.120
So if you consider the entire
pentagon, it is made up of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.680
five total slices.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.670
So it's three remaining out of
five total slices, so you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:35.590
could say that 3/5 of
the pentagon remain.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.170
Or you could say 2/5
were removed.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.070
That's two of the five slices
were removed, and then three

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.410
are remaining, or 3/5 of
the pentagon remain.
