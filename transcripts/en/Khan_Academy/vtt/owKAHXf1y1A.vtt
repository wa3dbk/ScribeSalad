00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.240
All the parameterizations
we've done so far have been

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.855
parameterizing a curve
using one parameter.

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:09.420
What we're going to start doing
this video is parameterizing a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.990
surface in three dimensions,
using two parameters.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.870
And we'll start with an
example of a torus.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.320
A torus, or more commonly
known, as a doughnut shape.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.300
And we know what a
doughnut looks like.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.990
Let me draw it in a suitable,
well, I don't have any

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.930
suitable doughnut colors,
so I'll just use green.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.740
A doughnut looks
something like this.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.460
It has a hole in the center,
And maybe the other side of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.750
the doughnut looks something
like that, and we could

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.840
shade it in like that.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.640
That is what a
doughnut looks like.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.010
So how do we construct that
using two parameters?

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.640
So what we want to do, is you
can just visualize it, a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.170
doughnut, if you were to
draw some axes here.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.230
So that's our doughut.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.310
Let me draw some axes.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.100
So let's say I have the z-axis
that goes straight up and down.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.030
So we have drawn it here, the
doughnut's a little at a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.430
tilt, so the z-axis, I'll
tilt it a little bit.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.580
So our z-axis goes straight
through the center

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.650
of the doughnut.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.880
So that right there, this is
going to be an exercise in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.810
drawing more than
anything else.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.830
So that is my z-axis, and then
you can imagine the z-axis goes

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.020
from there, and then this
coming out of here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.470
will be my x-axis.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.890
That right there is my x-axis,
and then maybe my y-axis

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.190
comes out like that.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.210
And the whole reason why I drew
it this way, is that if you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.860
imagine the cross section of
this doughnut, I'll draw a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.410
little bit neater, but the
cross section of this doughnut

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.710
in the x-z axis, is going to
look something like this.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.820
If I were to slice it in the
x-z axis, it would look

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.570
something like that.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.580
That would be the slice.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.510
It would trace out, and
we're thinking about not

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.570
a full doughnut, just the
surface of a doughnut.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.440
So it would trace out
a circle like this.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.570
If you were to cut the doughnut
in the positive z-y axis, it's

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.620
going to trace out a circle
that looks something

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.600
like that, right there.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.540
And if you go out here, you're
going to get bunch of circles.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.150
So if you think about it, it's
a bunch of circles rotated

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.950
around the z-axis.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.940
If you think of it that way,
it'll give us some good

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.190
intuition for the best way
to parameterize this thing.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.900
So let's do it that way.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.030
Let's start off with
just the z-y axis.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.690
I'll draw it a little bit
neater than I've done here.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.240
So that is the z-axis, and
that is y, just like that.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.630
And let's say that the center
of these circles, let's say it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.350
lies on, you know, it can lie,
when you cross the z-y axis,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.220
the center sits on the y-axis.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.770
I didn't draw it that
neatly here, but I think

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.730
you can visualize.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.070
So it sits right
there on the y-axis.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.200
And let's say that it is a
distance b away from the center

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.330
of the torus, or from the
z-axis it's a distance of b.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.170
It's always going to
be a distance of b.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.510
It's always, if you imagine the
top of the doughnut, let me

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420
draw the top of the doughnut.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.630
If you're looking down on a
doughnut, let me draw a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.420
doughnut right here, if you're
looking down on a doughnut, it

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.710
just looks something like that.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.760
The z-axis is just going to
be popping straight out.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.510
The x-axis would come down like
this, and then the y-axis would

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.370
go to the right, like that.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.210
So you can imagine, I'm
just flying above this.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.670
I'm sitting on the z-axis
looking down at the doughnut.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.000
It will look just like this.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.720
And if you imagine the cross
section, this circle right

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.050
here, the top part of the
circle if you're looking down,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.450
would look just like that.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680
And this distance b is a
distance from the z-axis

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.100
to the center of each
of these circles.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.920
So this distance, let me draw
it in the same color, from the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.280
center to the center of these
circles, that is going to be b.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.000
It's just going to keep
going to the center

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670
of the circles, b.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.840
That's going to be b,
that's going to be b.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.370
That's going to be b.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.590
From the center of our torus
to the center of our circle

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.810
that defines the torus,
it's a distance of b.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.380
So this distance right here,
that distance right there is b.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.780
And from b, we can imagine
we have a radius.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.570
A radius of length a.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.860
So these circles have
radius of length a.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.390
So this distance right here is
a, this distance right here is

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.520
a, this distance right there
is a, that distance

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.250
right there is a.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.910
If I were look at these
circles, these circles

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.650
have radius a.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.980
And what we're going to do
is have two parameters.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.710
One is the angle that this
radius makes with the x-z

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.520
plane, so you can imagine
the x-axis coming out.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.040
Let me do that in
the same color.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.750
You can imagine the
x-axis coming out here.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.570
So this is the x-z plane.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.480
So one parameter is going to
be the angle between our

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.840
radius and the x-z plane.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.670
We're going to call that angle,
or that parameter, we're

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.550
going to call that s.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.342
And so as s goes between 0 and
2 pi, as s goes between 0 in 2

00:05:33.342 --> 00:05:37.190
pi, when the 0 is just going to
be at this point right here,

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.960
and then as it goes to 2 pi,
you're going to trace out a

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.490
circle that looks
just like that.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.070
Now, we only have
one parameter.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.950
What we want to do is then
spin this circle around.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.550
What I just drew is that
circle right there.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.060
What we want to do is spin
the entire circle around.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.210
So let's define
another parameter.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.450
We'll call this one t, and
I'll take the top view again.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.700
This one's getting a
little bit messy.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.470
Let me draw another top view.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.700
As you can see, this is
all about visualization.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.910
So let's say this is my
x-axis, that is my y-axis.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.730
And we said we started
here on the z-y plane.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.580
We are b away from the z-axis,
so that distance is b.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.110
In this diagram, the z-axis
is just popping out at us.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.160
It's popping out of the page.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.490
We're looking straight down.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.540
It's just like the same
view as right there.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.170
And what I just drew, when s is
equal to 0 radians, we're going

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.860
to be out here, exactly
one radius further

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.700
along the y-axis.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.440
And then we're going to rotate.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.230
As we rotate around, we're
going to rotate and then

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.700
come all the way over here.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.760
That's when we're right over
there, and then come back down.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.670
So if you looked on the
top of the circle, it's

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.410
going to look like that.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.910
Now, to make the doughnut,
we're going to have to

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.010
rotate this whole setup
around the z-axis.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.500
Remember, the z-axis
is popping out.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.920
It's looking straight up at us.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.340
It's coming out of
your video screen.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.820
Now to rotate it, we're
going to rotate this

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.840
circle around the z-axis.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.490
And to do that, we'll define a
parameter that tells us how

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.210
much we have rotated it.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.940
So this is when we've
rotated 0 radians.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.550
At some point, we're going to
be over here, and we would

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.490
have rotated it, this is b as
well, and our circle is going

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.390
to be looking like this.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.640
This is maybe this point on
our doughnut, right there.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.390
At that point, we would
have rotated it,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.230
let's say p radians.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.880
So this parameter of how much
have we rotated around the

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.240
z-axis, how much have we gone
around that way, we're

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.560
going to call that t.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.900
And t is also going to
vary between 0 and 2 pi.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.960
And I want to make
this very clear.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.830
Let's actually draw the domain
that we're mapping from to

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.690
our surface, so that we
understand this fully.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.390
So let me draw some, and then
we'll talk about how we can

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.850
actually parameterize
that into a position

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.030
vector-valued function.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:21.030
So right here, let's
call that the t-axis.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.330
That's, remember, how much
we're rotated around

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.010
the z-axis right there.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:31.610
And let's call this
down here our s-axis.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.410
And I think this will help
things out a good bit.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.180
So when s is equal to 0, and
we vary just t, so they're

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.270
both going to vary
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:46.190
So this right here is 0,
this right here is 2 pi.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.540
Let me do some
things in between.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.840
This is pi, this would be pi
over 2 obviously, pi over 2,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.250
this would be 3 pi over 4.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.050
You do the same thing
on the p-axis.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.550
It's going to go up to 2 pi.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.560
Let's do that.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.820
So we're going to
go up to 2 pi.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.060
I really want you to visualize
this, because then the

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.190
parameterization, I think, will
be fairly straightforward.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:16.240
So that's 2 pi, this is pi,
this is pi over 2, and

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.890
then this is 3 pi over 4.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.930
So let's think about what it
looks like if you just hold s

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.770
constant at 0, and we just
vary t between zero and 2 pi.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.870
And let me do that in
magenta, right here.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.480
So we're holding s constant,
and we're just varying

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.250
the parameter 2 pi.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.800
So this, if you think about it,
should just form a curve in

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.030
three dimensions,
not a surface.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.500
Because we're only varying
one parameter right here.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.370
So let's think about
what this is.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:51.360
Remember, s is, let
me draw my axes.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:58.330
So that is my x-axis, that
is my y-axis, and then

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.970
this is my, I'm getting
messier and messier.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.630
That is my z-axis, right--
actually, let me draw it a

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.860
little bit bigger than that.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.570
I think it will help all
of our visualizations.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.080
All right.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:20.210
So this is my x-axis, that is
my y-axis, and then my z-axis

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.450
goes up like that. z-axis.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.360
Now remember, when s is equal
to 0, that means we haven't

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.550
rotated around this
circle at all.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.300
That means we're out here.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.830
We're going to be b away,
and then a away again.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.050
Right?

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.990
We haven't rotated
around this at all.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.630
We're setting s as
equal to zero.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.650
So essentially, we're going to
be b away, so this is going to

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.800
be a distance of b away, and
then we're going to

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.480
be another a away.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.310
The b is the center of the
circle, and then we're going

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.300
to be another a away.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.550
We're going to be
right over there.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.730
So this is a plus b away.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.130
And then we're going to vary t.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.870
Remember, t was how much we've
gone around the z-axis.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.670
These were top views over here.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:07.640
So this line right here, in our
s-t domain, we can say, when we

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.940
map it, or parameterize it,
it'll correspond to the curve

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.980
that's essentially the outer
edge of are doughnut.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.690
If this is the top view of the
doughnut, it will be the outer

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.800
edge of the doughnut,
just like that.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.690
So let me draw the outer edge.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.620
And to do that a little bit
better, let me draw the axes

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.440
in both the positive and
the negative domain.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.140
It might make my graph a little
bit easier to visualize things.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:33.820
Positive and negative domain,
this is negative z right there.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.480
So this line in our t-s plane,
I guess we could say, this

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.470
magenta line, we hold s at 0
radians and we increase t, this

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.750
is t is zero, this is t is
equal to 2 pi, that's t is

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:53.290
equal to pi, this is t is equal
to 3 pi over 2, all the way

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.780
back to t is equal to 2 pi.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.470
This line corresponds to that
line, as we rotate, as we

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.890
increase t and hold
s constant at 0.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.900
Now let's do another point.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.750
Let's say when s is at pi,
right, remember, when s is

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.660
at pi, we've gone exactly,
pi is 180 degrees.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.430
When s is at pi, we've
gone exactly 180 degrees

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.340
around the circle, around
each of these circles.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.810
So we're right over there.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.520
And now let's hold it constant
at pi, and then rotate it

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.710
around to form our doughnut.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:27.540
So we're going to form the
inside of our doughnut.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.120
So when s is at pie, and we're
going to take t from 0, so when

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.620
s is pi and t is 0, we're going
to be, this was the center of

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.410
our circle, we're going
to be a below that.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.930
We're going to be
right over there.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:47.430
And then as we vary, as we
increase t, so as we move up

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:54.620
along, holding s at pi, and we
increase t, we're going to

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:02.070
trace out the inside of our
doughnut, that will look

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.170
something like that.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.340
That was my best
shot at drawing it.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.050
And then we can do
that multiple times.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.660
When s is pi over 2, I want to
do multiple different colors,

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.960
when s is pi over 2, we've
rotated up here exactly

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.980
90 degrees, right?

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.900
Pi over 2 is 90 degrees
at this point.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.500
And then if we vary t, we're
essentially tracing out the

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.840
top of the doughnut, right?

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.110
So let me make sure I draw it .

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.990
So the cross section, the top
of the doughnut, we're going

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.690
to start off right over here.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.910
So when s is pi over 2, and you
vary it right, and then you

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.100
very t, I'm having trouble
drawing straight lines.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.500
And then you vary t, it's
going to look like this.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.980
That's the top of that
circle right there.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.420
The top of this circle is
going to be right there.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.490
The top of this circle is
going to be right over there.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.000
Top of the circle is going
to be right over there.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.300
So then I just
connect the dots.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.470
It's going to look
something like that.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.770
That is the top
of our doughnut.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.750
If I was doing this top view,
it would be the top of the

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.100
doughnut, just like that.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.750
And if I wanted to do the
bottom of the doughnut, just to

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.530
make the picture clear, if I
were to make the bottom of the

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:13.350
doughnut, the bottom of the
doughnut would be-- see, if I

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.210
take s as 3 pi over 4 and I
vary t, that's the bottoms

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.850
of our doughnuts.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.870
So let me draw the circle, it's
right there, the circle is

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.400
right there, you wouldn't be
able to see the whole thing

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.950
if this wasn't transparent.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.660
So you'd be tracing out the
bottom of the doughnut,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.350
just like that.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:33.860
I know this graph is becoming
a little confusing, but

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.860
hopefully you get the idea.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.470
When s is 2 pi again, you're
going to be back to the outside

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.220
of the doughnut again.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.460
That's also going
to be in purple.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.480
So that's what happens when we
hold the s constant at certain

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.730
values and vary the t.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.780
Now let's do the opposite.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.140
What happens if we hold t
at 0, and we very the s?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.610
So t is 0, that means we
haven't rotated at all yet.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.160
So we're in the z-y plane.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:16.690
So t is 0, and s will start at
0, and it'll go to pi over 2,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.180
that's that point over there.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.670
Then it'll go to pi.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.300
This point is the same
thing as that point.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.020
Then it will go to 3 pi over
4, then it'll come back

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.550
all the way to 2 pi.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.080
So this line corresponds to
this circle, right there.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:43.270
We could keep doing these if we
pick when t is pi -- let me use

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.290
a different color, that's
not different enough.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.870
When t is pi over
2, just like that.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.980
We would have rotated around
the z-axis 90 degrees,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.280
so now we're over here.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.710
And now when we vary s, s will
start off over here, and

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.330
it'll go all the way
around like that.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.025
So this line corresponds
to that circle.

00:16:05.025 --> 00:16:08.180
We could keep doing
it like this.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.610
When t is equal to pi, that
means we've got all the way

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.670
around the circle like that,
and now when we vary s from 0

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:18.470
to pi over 2, we're going to
start all the way over here,

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.590
and then we're going to vary,
all the way, we're going to go

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.430
down and hit all those contours
that we talked about before,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.920
and I'll do one more, just
to kind of make this,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.510
the scaffold, clear.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.540
This dark purple,
hopefully you can see it.

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.150
When t is 3 pi over 4,
we've rotated all the way.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.070
So we're in the x-z plane.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.900
And then when you vary s, s
will start off over here, and

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:48.460
as you increase s, you're going
to go around the circle, around

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.950
the circle, just like that.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.220
And of course, when you get all
the way back full circle, t

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.810
over pi over 2, that's
the same thing.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.170
You're back over here again.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.620
So this is going to be, we can
even shade it the same color.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.000
And hopefully you're
getting a sense now of

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.130
the parameterization.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.450
I haven't done any math yet.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.450
I haven't actually showed you
how to mathematically represent

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.360
it as a vector value function,
but hopefully you're getting

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.670
a sense of what it means to
parameterize by two parameters.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:23.080
And just to get an idea of what
these areas on our s-t plane

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:30.350
correspond to onto this
surface, in I guess you could

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.640
say, in R3, this little square
right here, let's see

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.300
what's bounded by.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.900
This little square, I want to
make sure I picked a square

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.100
that I can draw neatly.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.755
So this square right here, that
is between, when you look at t,

00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:50.070
it's between 0 and pi over 2.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.740
And s is between
0 and pi over 2.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:04.120
So this right here is
this part of our torus.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.840
If you're looking at it from
the top, it would look

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.390
like that, right there.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:16.020
You can imagine, we've
transformed this square.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.560
I haven't even shown you how
to do it mathematically yet.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.130
But we've transformed
this square to this

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.570
part of the doughnut.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:27.340
Now, I think we've done about
as much as I can do on

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.530
the visualization side.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.490
I'll stop this video here.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:31.970
In the next video, we're going
to actually talk about, how

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:35.290
do we actually parameterize
using these two parameters?

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:39.380
Remember, s takes around each
of these circles, and then t

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.090
takes us around the z-axis.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.690
And if you take all of the
combinations of s and t, you're

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.050
going to have every point
along the surface of this

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.470
torus or this doughnut.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.760
How do you actually go from an
s and a t that goes from 0 to

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.030
2 pi, in both cases, and turn
it into a three-dimensional

00:18:56.030 --> 00:19:00.130
position vector-valued function
that would define this surface?

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.280
We're going to do that
in the next video.
