00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.240
We already know that the
sum of the interior angles

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.560
of a triangle add
up to 180 degrees.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.415
So if the measure
of this angle is a,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.460
the measure of this
angle over here is b,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.940
and the measure of
this angle is c,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.030
we know that a plus b plus
c is equal to 180 degrees.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.800
But what happens
when we have polygons

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.300
with more than three sides?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.460
So let's try the
case where we have

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.300
a four-sided polygon--
a quadrilateral.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.120
And I am going to
make it irregular just

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.600
to show that whatever we
do here it probably applies

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.270
to any quadrilateral
with four sides.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.282
Not just things that have right
angles, and parallel lines,

00:00:35.282 --> 00:00:35.990
and all the rest.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.910
Actually, that
looks a little bit

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.250
too close to being parallel.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.416
So let me draw it like this.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.350
So the way you can think
about it with a four

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.090
sided quadrilateral,
is well we already

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.970
know about this-- the measures
of the interior angles

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.680
of a triangle add up to 180.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.820
So maybe we can divide
this into two triangles.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.830
So from this point
right over here,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.620
if we draw a line
like this, we've

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.970
divided it into two triangles.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.550
And so if the measure this
angle is a, measure of this

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.580
is b, measure of
that is c, we know

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.540
that a plus b plus c is
equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.310
And then if we call this over
here x, this over here y,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.530
and that z, those are the
measures of those angles.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.232
We know that x plus y plus
z is equal to 180 degrees.

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:23.190
And so if we want the
measure of the sum of all

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.830
of the interior angles,
all of the interior angles

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.050
are going to be
b plus z-- that's

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.270
two of the interior
angles of this polygon--

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.000
plus this angle, which is
just going to be a plus x.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.860
a plus x is that whole angle.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.040
The whole angle for
the quadrilateral.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.927
Plus this whole angle, which
is going to be c plus y.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.185
And we already know a plus
b plus c is 180 degrees.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.370
And we know that z plus x plus
y is equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.322
So plus 180 degrees, which
is equal to 360 degrees.

00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:10.030
So I think you see
the general idea here.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.680
We just have to figure out how
many triangles we can divide

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
something into, and then we
just multiply by 180 degrees

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.160
since each of those triangles
will have 180 degrees.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.210
Let's do one more
particular example.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.461
And then we'll try to do a
general version where we're

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:26.585
just trying to figure out
how many triangles can we

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:27.630
fit into that thing.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.760
So let me draw an
irregular pentagon.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.070
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.820
So it looks like a little bit
of a sideways house there.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.260
Once again, we can draw
our triangles inside

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.640
of this pentagon.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.640
So that would be
one triangle there.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.020
That would be another triangle.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.740
So I'm able to draw three
non-overlapping triangles that

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.350
perfectly cover this pentagon.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.122
This is one triangle, the other
triangle, and the other one.

00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:57.080
And we know each of those
will have 180 degrees

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.889
if we take the sum
of their angles.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.430
And we also know that the sum
of all of those interior angles

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.050
are equal to the sum
of the interior angles

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.240
of the polygon as a whole.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.540
And to see that, clearly,
this interior angle

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.850
is one of the angles
of the polygon.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.290
This is as well.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.587
But when you take the sum
of this one and this one,

00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:16.670
then you're going to get
that whole interior angle

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.750
of the polygon.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.875
And when you take the sum
of that one and that one,

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.250
you get that entire one.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.270
And then when you take
the sum of that one

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.972
plus that one plus that one, you
get that entire interior angle.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:29.430
So if you take the sum of all
of the interior angles of all

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.430
of these triangles, you're
actually just finding

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.810
the sum of all of the interior
angles of the polygon.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.990
So in this case, you have
one, two, three triangles.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.980
So three times 180
degrees is equal to what?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.360
300 plus 240 is
equal to 540 degrees.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.940
Now let's generalize it.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.520
And to generalize
it, let's realize

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.280
that just to get our
first two triangles,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.160
we have to use up four sides.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.250
We have to use up all the four
sides in this quadrilateral.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.161
We had to use up four
of the five sides--

00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:02.410
right here-- in this pentagon.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.480
One, two, and then three, four.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.550
So four sides give
you two triangles.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.970
And it seems like, maybe,
every incremental side

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.470
you have after that, you can
get another triangle out of it.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.130
Let's experiment with a hexagon.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.700
And I'm just going to try to
see how many triangles I get out

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.200
of it.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.283
So one, two, three,
four, five, six sides.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.140
I get one triangle out
of these two sides.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.980
One, two sides of
the actual hexagon.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.050
I can get another
triangle out of these two

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.450
sides of the actual hexagon.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.920
And it looks like I can
get another triangle out

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.520
of each of the remaining sides.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.010
So one out of that one.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.860
And then one out of that
one, right over there.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.060
So in general, it
seems like-- let's say.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.110
So let's say that
I have s sides.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.565
s-sided polygon.

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:02.160
And I'll just
assume-- we already

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.230
saw the case for four sides,
five sides, or six sides.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.740
So we can assume that s
is greater than 4 sides.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.240
Let's say I have
an s-sided polygon,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.240
and I want to figure out how
many non-overlapping triangles

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.900
will perfectly
cover that polygon.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.234
How many can I fit inside of it?

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:20.566
And then I just have to
multiply the number of triangles

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:22.500
times 180 degrees
to figure out what

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.690
are the sum of the interior
angles of that polygon.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.600
So let's figure out
the number of triangles

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.170
as a function of
the number of sides.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.320
So once again, four
of the sides are

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.060
going to be used to
make two triangles.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.120
So those two sides
right over there.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.172
And then we have two
sides right over there.

00:05:41.172 --> 00:05:43.130
I can draw one triangle
over-- and I'm not even

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.294
going to talk about
what happens on the rest

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:46.460
of the sides of the polygon.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.918
You could imagine putting a
big black piece of construction

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:49.470
paper.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.959
There might be other sides here.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm not going to even
worry about them right now.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.610
So out of these two
sides I can draw

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.420
one triangle, just like that.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.980
Out of these two sides, I can
draw another triangle right

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.640
over there.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.550
So four sides used
for two triangles.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.900
And then, no matter how many
sides I have left over-- so

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.280
I've already used four of
the sides, but after that,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.900
if I have all sorts
of craziness here.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.300
I could have all sorts
of craziness here.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.420
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.950
So I could have all sorts of
craziness right over here.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.820
It looks like every
other incremental side

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.380
I can get another
triangle out of it.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.060
So that's one triangle out
of there, one triangle out

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.500
of that side, one
triangle out of that side,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.220
one triangle out of that side,
and then one triangle out

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.210
of this side.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.290
So for example, this
figure that I've drawn

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.000
is a very irregular-- one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.970
eight, nine, 10.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:48.620
Is that right?

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.870
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.210
It is a decagon.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.050
And in this decagon,
four of the sides

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.220
were used for two triangles.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.910
So I got two triangles
out of four of the sides.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.820
And out of the other
six sides I was

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.120
able to get a triangle each.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.440
These are six.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.175
This is one, two,
three, four, five.

00:07:08.175 --> 00:07:10.633
Actually, let me make sure I'm
counting the number of sides

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:11.540
right.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:21.909
So I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine,

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:22.747
10.

00:07:22.747 --> 00:07:23.580
So let me make sure.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.691
Did I count-- am I just
not seeing something?

00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:28.190
Oh, I see.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.410
I actually didn't-- I have to
draw another line right over

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:30.770
here.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.450
These are two different
sides, and so I

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.740
have to draw another
line right over here.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.319
I can get another triangle
out of that right over there.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.360
And so there you have it.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.960
I have these two triangles
out of four sides.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.800
And out of the other
six remaining sides

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.250
I get a triangle each.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.110
So plus six triangles.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.610
I got a total of
eight triangles.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.700
And so we can generally
think about it.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.510
The first four, sides we're
going to get two triangles.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.170
So let me write this down.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.630
So our number of triangles
is going to be equal to 2.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.370
And then, I've already
used four sides.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.070
So the remaining sides
I get a triangle each.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.440
So the remaining sides
are going to be s minus 4.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.730
So the number of triangles are
going to be 2 plus s minus 4.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.280
2 plus s minus 4
is just s minus 2.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.910
So if I have an
s-sided polygon, I

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.110
can get s minus 2 triangles that
perfectly cover that polygon

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.830
and that don't overlap with
each other, which tells us

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.549
that an s-sided polygon, if
it has s minus 2 triangles,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.809
that the interior angles
in it are going to be

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:40.559
s minus 2 times 180 degrees.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.309
Which is a pretty cool result.

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:47.540
So if someone told you that they
had a 102-sided polygon-- so

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.680
s is equal to 102 sides.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.990
You can say, OK, the
number of interior angles

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.140
are going to be 102 minus 2.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.730
So it's going to be 100
times 180 degrees, which

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:02.850
is equal to 180 with two
more zeroes behind it.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.620
So it'd be 18,000 degrees
for the interior angles

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.930
of a 102-sided polygon.
