00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.980
In the last video we discovered
what seems like a

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.580
problem with the Calvin Cycle.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.350
That you have this big protein
here, enzyme, that facilitates

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.290
the Calvin Cycle.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.790
All of the molecules that are
involved bond to this and then

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.680
it twists and turns and it jams
things together so that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.570
they react properly.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.900
And we know what this
is, the RuBisCo.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.890
RuBisCo enzyme, or ribulose

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.140
bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.770
And we know when the Calvin
Cycle operates properly you'll

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.880
have some carbon dioxide
attached in one

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.240
part of this enzyme.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.440
And then you'll have some RuBP,
or maybe you could call

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.390
it the proper word, ribulose-1
5-bisphosphate.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.880
And they're going to react.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.650
And then after they react, if
everything with the Calvin

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.040
Cycle is going properly, they're
going to react and

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.830
form-- they're going to be
jammed together and then split

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.000
into-- for one molecule of that
and one molecule of that,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.550
you're going to have
two molecules of

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.800
3-phosphoglycerate.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.340
In the last video I started with
three of these and three

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.180
of these so I ended up
with six of these.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.190
But for every one of these you
end up with two of these.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.050
This is the proper
Calvin Cycle.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.730
Then these turn into your
phosphoglyceraldehydes.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.540
These turn into two

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.590
phosphoglyceraldehydes, or PGALs.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.750
And then for every six of these
that are produced-- and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.640
maybe I should write a three
here, a three here and then

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.170
I'll have six of these-- and
for every six of these that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.840
are produced, five go back into
the cycle to produce.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.320
So five PGALs, or glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate go

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.940
back into the cycle to produce
the ribulose bisphosphate.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.370
And one of them is kind of our
end product of photosynthesis

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.530
that can be used to produce
other carbohydrates.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.060
So, one PGAL.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.280
And the whole problem, we saw
with the Calvin Cycle, is that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.420
RuBisCo does not only
fix carbon dioxide.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.320
That instead of carbon
dioxide we might

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.509
have an oxygen molecule.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.890
We might have an oxygen molecule
that jumps in here.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.110
And it can also attach to
the RuBisCo enzyme.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.090
And in that situation, the
oxygen and the ribulose

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.050
bisphosphate react.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.220
So if we had three ribulose
bisphosphates and three

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.780
oxygens, instead of producing
six phosphoglycerates we're

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.710
only going to produce five
phosphoglycerates and we're

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.905
going to produce five
phosphoglycolates.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.590
Which is that byproduct that
gets processed later on.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.520
And then these five.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520
You're going to have
five here.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.890
You can't have one left over.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.420
And then you're not going
to produce anything.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.380
In doing this whole cycle
you have to use up a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.960
bunch of ATPs and NADHs.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440
So this is a problem.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.290
If there's a lot of oxygen
present, or even a little bit

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.300
of oxygen present, it's
going to make this a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.920
little bit less efficient.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.410
Because every now and then an
oxygen's going to jump in

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.770
where a carbon dioxide is needed
to actually produce an

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.660
actual carbohydrate
in the end.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.800
So how do plants solve
this problem?

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.140
Well, one solution would be to
operate the Calvin Cycle in an

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.500
environment where there is
very, very little oxygen.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.900
Or you can almost
say no oxygen.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.780
And this is exactly what
some plants do.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.980
You're like, wait,
how do I do that?

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.600
Do I have to go to a planet
where there's no oxygen?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.850
No!

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.980
What they do is-- and to
understand this we'll have to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.173
understand a little bit of
the actual make-up of

00:03:40.173 --> 00:03:41.100
the leaf of a plant.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.990
And that doesn't hurt because
everything we've been doing

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.190
now has been biochemistry.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.670
it's nice to see leaves.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.750
So if I draw-- let's say
that that is a leaf.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.880
That is a leaf.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.990
I can make it look
nice like a leaf.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.620
That's a nice looking leaf.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.320
On your leaf's surface, and
actually on both sides of it,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.360
you have these little pores,
these little holes on the

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.930
leaf's surface.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.020
They are actually surrounded
by these things

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.930
called guard cells.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.780
But the important thing is that
these little pores-- and

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.940
they're actually much smaller
than that; you'd have to get a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.850
microscope to actually see
them-- they're called stomata.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.570
Or one individual of
these pores or

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.579
holes is called a stoma.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.940
And this is where the oxygen
and the-- mainly the carbon

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.920
dioxide-- but this is where the
air enters the cell and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.870
this is actually where
water vapor is also

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.860
released from the cell.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.420
If we draw a cross section of
a leaf, so let me do my best

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.810
to draw a cross section
like this.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.280
Let me draw it like that
and maybe that's the

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.300
bottom of the leaf.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.820
This would be my stoma.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.640
This is the actual opening.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.410
This is the actual opening and
plants can actually open and

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.660
close their stomata.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.760
The plural of stoma
is stomata.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.520
They can open and close
their stomata.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.760
But the important thing to
realize is what's going on

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.390
inside the cell.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.810
So most plants, you have this
whole photosynthetic process,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.180
or photosynthesis process,
occurring in these mesophyll

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.090
cells, which are really just
these middle layer cells.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.180
And I'll do a detailed video
in the future about the

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.970
anatomy of a plant.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.530
But these are the
mesophyll cells.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.880
This is where photosynthesis
normally occurrs.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.890
And because they use carbon
dioxide, or they need air--

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.110
actually I drew it wrong.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.990
Let me draw it a little
bit better.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.050
There's actually space
between them, so that

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.520
air can get to them.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.710
There's mesophyll, I'm doing
a very rough drawing.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.950
But in this situation air can
enter through a stoma and then

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.650
it can fill the space between
these mesophyll cells and it

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.010
can provide air to the
mesophyll cells.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.740
And when I say air, that air is
made up of carbon dioxide

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.440
and oxygen and nitrogen
and all the things

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.170
that are in our air.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.320
And of course, it needs the
carbon dioxide to actually

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.560
perform the Calvin Cycle.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.810
Now, we just said that it's
not just getting CO2.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.940
If it was just getting CO2
you wouldn't worry about

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.430
photorespiration.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.170
It's also getting oxygen.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.280
It's also getting molecular
oxygen.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.430
So what can the plant to
do to prevent this?

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.770
And not all plants-- you know,
most plants just deal with

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.570
photorespiration.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.540
It's just a little less
efficient than the ideal.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.440
But some plants have-- I guess
we could say-- evolved past

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.120
the photorespiration problem.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.490
And these are called
C-4 plants.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.290
Or they perform C-4
photosynthesis.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.500
And we'll understand, hopefully
in a few minutes,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.000
why it's called C-4.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.980
Just as a reminder, when we go
up to the mechanism up here.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.020
The classic Calvin Cycle, the
first byproduct is this

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.850
phosphoglycerate, this
is a 3-carbon chain.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.870
So it's saying that the first
time that you fix carbon

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.230
dioxide, or actually the first
time you fix carbon dioxide or

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.220
oxygen, but let's say the first
time you fix carbon

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.810
dioxide you end up with a
3-carbon chain molecule.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:02.680
That's why this is called
C-3 photosynthesis.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.310
So, that's a clue.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.340
On C-4 plants, the very first
time that they fix carbon

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.870
dioxide they must end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.150
And what they do-- and this is
the interesting thing-- is you

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.350
have all your mesophyll cells
that are out here.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.110
They're getting air.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.030
They're getting carbon
dioxide.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.480
You know, they're getting carbon
dioxide and they're

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.590
getting oxygen and
whatever else.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.550
So you have all your mesophyll
cells that are getting air.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.555
But you also have cells that
are deeper within, more

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:35.150
embedded within the leaf that
aren't being exposed directly

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.060
to the air coming through
the stomata.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.700
So you have these bundle-sheath
cells.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.450
And these are actually the cells
that surround the actual

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.300
pipes in the plant that
distribute the fluid up and

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.760
down the plant.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.880
And we'll do a whole video on
the anatomy of the plant.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.560
I really just want you to
understand what's going on in

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.420
C-4 photosynthesis.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.700
So you have these other cells
that are more embedded.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.250
They don't have direct
access to the air.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.930
So these are bundle-sheath
cells.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.460
And what these plants do is,
the carbon dioxide comes in

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.030
and-- so in the standard Calvin
Cycle, everything

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.040
happens in the mesophyll cells
and you have to deal with

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.360
photorespiration.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.100
In your C-4 plant, or your
plants performing C-4

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.950
photosynthesis, what happens
is the carbon dioxide comes

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.820
in-- so this is in the
mesophyll cell.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.020
Let me be neat about it.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:37.150
So in our mesophyll cell, that's
that right there, you

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.350
have CO2 coming in
and it reacts.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.930
Instead of reacting with RuBP
or ribulose bisphosphate, it

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.580
reacts with another very hairy
sounding compound, we'll just

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.610
call it PEP.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.580
But it's phosphoenolpyruvate
So that's PEP.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:02.880
You just have to remember,
it is a 3-carbon chain.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.140
Now let me write down the word,
because sometimes you

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.640
might want to know, what
does PEP stand for?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.470
It's phosphoenolpyruvate or

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.910
phosphoenolpyruvic acid Either way.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.270
3-carbon molecule, it's got
other stuff hanging off of

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.930
this but we just have to
remember the carbons.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.620
So when these two react what are
you going to end up with?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.870
Well you could guess.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.930
You have one carbon, you
have three carbons.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.965
You're going to end up with
a 4-carbon molecule.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:42.980
And this reaction right here
is facilitated, not by

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.460
RuBisCo, ribulose bisphosphate
carboxylase oxygenase.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.720
It's facilitated by a
different enzyme.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.920
And this is the key.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.310
This is the key for C-4.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.970
This is a different enzyme.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.360
This is called PEP
carboxylase.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.740
Let me write it down.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.990
PEP carboxylase.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.710
And that's a fitting name.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:09.880
Remember, RuBisCo or ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase, it

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:15.480
reacted ribulose bisphosphate
with carbon or oxygen.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.570
That's where that oxygenase
comes from.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.410
But now we have something
that reacts PEP, our

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.580
phosphoenolpyruvate with
carbon dioxide.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.780
So it's called PEP
carboxylase.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.800
Actually this is carboxylase,
not carboxylate.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.330
It's an enzyme.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.900
This is PEP carboxylase.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.370
And what's special about PEP
carboxylase, and why it's

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.920
useful in preventing
photorespiration, is that it

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.405
can only fix carbon.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.420
Not oxygen.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.950
So you can imagine, this
is occurring in

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:51.830
the mesophyll cell.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.020
You have oxygen and carbon
dioxide running around here.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.305
But only carbon dioxide can
react with the PEP via the PEP

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:01.960
carboxylase.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.760
So then they react, they
actually produce oxaloacetic

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:15.210
acid or oxaloacetate And you
might remember this from the

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:15.960
Kreb Cycle.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.510
This was the thing that was the
first reactive species in

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.330
our Kreb Cycle.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.470
So all of these molecules, they
keep showing up in our

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.370
chemical pathways.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.980
And that's interesting if you
find that type of thing

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.680
interesting.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.290
But the important thing is,
they form oxaloacetate and

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.650
then oxaloacetate
gets converted.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.970
Let me make it, I made
this not as neatly as

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.870
I would like to.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:44.620
But then that gets converted to
either malate or aspartate

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.090
but these are all 4-carbon
molecules.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.330
They're a little different;
they're going to have

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.050
different oxygens and hydrogens
hanging off of them.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:12:04.990
But this is either malate
or aspartate

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.210
Most books will just say, oh it
will eventually just form

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:10.940
into malate only.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:17.740
And then this, this malate, will
then essentially react to

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.965
produce carbon dioxide.

00:12:18.965 --> 00:12:19.730
And you're like, wait.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.720
That doesn't make sense.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.800
I have carbon dioxide, it gets
fixed on oxaloacetic acid and

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.610
then it gets turned into malate
or aspartate And then

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.350
later I'm going to turn into
carbon dioxide again.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.610
What's the whole point?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.070
And this is the key.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.440
This is the whole crux
of the issue.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.620
So now this malate is going to
be converted back into PEP and

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.370
carbon dioxide.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.960
You're like, what was
the whole point

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.080
of this whole reaction?

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.380
I just ended up with carbon
dioxide and PEP again.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.690
I'm just going in circles.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.830
But the neat thing about this,
and the reason why this

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.540
prevents photorespiration is
that this part, this part of

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.030
the reaction right here-- maybe
I should do it like

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.630
this-- this part of the
reaction occurs in the

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.000
mesophyll cell.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.980
It occurs up here.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.440
It occurs over here in
the mesophyll cell.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.250
So you have this malate.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.120
And then the malate actually
gets transferred into these

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.090
bundle-sheath cells.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.090
So the malate gets transferred
into the bundle-sheath cells

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:28.340
via little tubes that connect
the cells called plasmodesmata

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.110
Sounds like the name
of a horror movie.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.290
So let me draw this a
little bit neater.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:40.080
So over here you have, with
exposure to the air, you have

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.910
your mesophyll cell.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.240
Air is coming in, O2, CO2,
everything is coming in.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.580
But only CO2 can be
fixed with PEP.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.860
So you have the PEP here, the
phosphoenolpyruvate So you

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.810
have your Pep here.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.880
Only CO2 can be reacted with
PEP because of the PEP

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.130
carboxylase.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.490
This is the enzyme
that's operating.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.570
So this is much more specific
than the ribulose bisphosphate

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.250
carboxylase, or the RuBisCo.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.080
So the oxygen just
gets ignored.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.810
Even though it's hanging around
these mesophyll cells.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.950
And then these, this
gets converted.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.500
Oxaloacetic acid.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.720
And then to malate.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:32.200
But once it gets converted to
malate, the malate gets

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.660
transferred deeper into the
actual cell via these

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:43.860
plasmodesmata So this might be
butting right up against

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.410
bundle-sheath cell, that's
deeper in the cell.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.280
This bundle-sheath cell has
no access to oxygen.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.180
So the malate comes in.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.970
You have these little pipes
that connect the cell.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.450
Maybe I'll just draw one pipe.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.340
So let's say there's one pipe.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.910
So the malate can come here.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.040
And then, within this deeper
cell, within this

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:12.260
bundle-sheath cell, it can
then react to form carbon

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.600
dioxide and pyruvate.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.146
And then the pyruvate--
so let's just

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:19.750
say this is the pyruvate.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.040
That pyruvate can then later
go back to actually

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.170
form the PEP again.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.920
So this can go back through
your plasmodesmata

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.810
and form the PEP.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.880
So the whole value here is, now
in the bundle-sheath cell,

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.690
I have an environment that
only has carbon dioxide.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.210
I have no oxygen here.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:38.150
I was able to essentially
select for the

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.160
carbon dioxide outside.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.090
Or closer to the air in
the mesophyll cell.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.360
And now that I'm deeper within
the plant, I'm in an

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.520
environment that only has CO2,
because I've already

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.240
selected for it.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.900
And now I can perform
the Calvin Cycle.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.960
So now, inside this deeper
cell, inside this

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.940
bundle-sheath cell, I can fix
the carbon dioxide with the

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.410
ribulose bisphosphate using
RuBisCo, just like we learned

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.630
in the original Calvin Cycle.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.560
And we have the whole cycle
and we produce our sugars.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.670
We produce our
phosphoglyceraldehydees or our

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.350
PGALs, whatever you
want to call them.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.930
And the whole value this is,
that we were able to avoid the

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.210
photorespiration problem.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.760
Because now the Calvin Cycle is
occurring in an environment

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.640
that only has carbon dioxide.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.580
And I think I already mentioned
it, but this is

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.050
called C-4 photosynthesis.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.120
And it's an adaption to make
sure that you don't waste

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.045
cycles of your Calvin Cycle
through photorespiration.

00:16:38.045 --> 00:16:41.130
And of course it was called C-4,
because the first time

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:43.350
that carbon gets fixed
it doesn't happen

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.390
in the Calvin Cycle.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.440
It happens up here, with
PEP carboxylase.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.060
And it gets fixed with PEP
into a 4-carbon chain.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.730
And that's why it's called
C-4 photosynthesis.
