00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.680
What i want to do in this video

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.349
is to come up with a relationship

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:05.741
between the area of a triangle

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:08.495
and the triangle's circumscribed circle

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:09.918
or circum-circle.

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:11.722
So before we think about the circum-circle

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.476
let's just think about the area of the triangle.

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:24.806
So let's say that the triangle looks something like this.

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:27.025
Actually I don't want to make it look isosceles.

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:31.591
So let me make it a little bit

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:36.009
so it doesn't look like any particular type of triangle

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:40.038
and let's call this traingle "ABC".

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:41.237
That's the vertices

00:00:41.237 --> 00:00:45.268
and then the length of the side opposite "A" is "a"

00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:48.775
"b" over here, and then "c"

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:51.249
We know how to calculate the area of this triangle

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:52.587
if we know its height.

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:57.005
If we drop an altitude right here

00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.571
and if this altitude has length "h"

00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:05.280
we know that the area of [ABC]

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.221
- and we write [ABC] with the brackets around it

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.858
means the area of the traingle [ABC] -

00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:15.310
is equal to 1/2 times the base, which is "b"

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.847
times the height.

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:19.544
Fair enough.

00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:21.616
We have an expression for the area.

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:22.719
Let's see if we can somehow

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.501
relate some of these things with the area

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:30.332
to the radius of the triangle's circumscribed circle.

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:32.654
So the circumscribed circle is a circle

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:36.424
that passes through all of the vertices of the triangle

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:38.910
and every triangle has a circumscribed circle.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.326
So let me try to draw it.

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:43.667
This is the hard part, right over here

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:49.825
so it might look something like this

00:01:49.825 --> 00:01:51.812
That's fair enough. That's close enough to a circle

00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:53.800
I think you get the general idea

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.742
That is the circum-circle for this triangle.

00:01:56.742 --> 00:02:00.608
or this triangle's circumscribed circle.

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:02.366
Let me label it.

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:13.186
This is the circum-circle for this triangle.

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:16.743
Now let's think about the center of that circum-circle

00:02:16.743 --> 00:02:19.607
sometimes refer to as the circumcenter.

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:21.722
So looks like it would be sitting

00:02:21.722 --> 00:02:23.227
I don't know, just eyeballing it

00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:24.532
right on this little "b" here.

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:27.355
So that's the circum-circle of the circle

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:30.343
Let's draw a diameter through that circumcircle

00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:33.129
and draw a diameter from vertex "B"

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.970
through that circumcenter.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.794
So then we go there, and we just keep going over here

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:46.850
Let's call this point over here "D".

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.566
Now let's create a triangle with vertices A, B, and D.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:53.621
So we can just draw another line over here

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:56.253
and we have triangle ABD

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:58.509
Now we proved in the geometry play

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.665
- and it's not actually a crazy prove at all -

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:05.312
that any triangle that's inscribed in a circle

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:07.650
where one of the sides of the triangle

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.684
is a diameter of the circle

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.723
then that is going to be a right triangle

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:16.983
and the angle that is going to be 90 degrees

00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:19.253
is the angle opposite the diameter

00:03:19.253 --> 00:03:21.545
So this is the right angle right here.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:24.407
You can derive that, pretty straightforward.

00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:32.255
You have this arc here that is 180 degrees.

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:33.843
because obviously this is a diameter.

00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:36.793
And it subtends this inscribed angle.

00:03:36.793 --> 00:03:39.896
We've also proved that an inscribed angle

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:41.287
that is subtended by the arc

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.034
will be half of the arc length

00:03:43.034 --> 00:03:45.485
This is an 180 degree arc

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:47.202
so this is going to be a 90 degree angle.

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:50.434
So either way this's going to be 90 degrees over there

00:03:50.434 --> 00:03:52.143
The other thing we see

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:54.516
is that we have this arc right over here

00:03:54.516 --> 00:03:55.670
that I'm drawing in magenta

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.240
the arc that goes from "A" to "B"

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.692
That arc subtends two different angles in our drawing

00:04:01.692 --> 00:04:05.239
- it subtends this angle right over here, angle ACB

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.668
it subtends that right over there -

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:11.066
but it also subtends angle ADB

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:12.773
that's why we construct it this way

00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:14.753
So it also subtends this

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:18.917
So these two angles are going to be congruent.

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.059
They'll both have half the degree measure

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.241
of this arc over here

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.232
because they're both inscribed angles

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:28.356
subtended by the same exact arc.

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:30.118
Something interesting is popping up.

00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:31.888
We have two triangles here

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:40.434
we have triangle ABD and triangle BEC

00:04:40.434 --> 00:04:41.883
They have two angles that resemble

00:04:41.883 --> 00:04:45.747
They have right angle and this magenta angle

00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:47.924
and their third angle must be the same.

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:49.209
We'll do it in yellow

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:53.842
The third angle must be congruent to that angle.

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:55.942
They have three angles that are the same.

00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:59.018
They must be similar triangles.

00:04:59.018 --> 00:05:01.539
or the ratio between the corresponding sides

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.725
must be the same.

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:05.630
So we can use that information now

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.635
to relate the length of this side

00:05:07.635 --> 00:05:09.841
which is really the diameter, is two times the radius

00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:12.705
to the height of this smaller triangle.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:13.645
We know the relationship

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:14.670
between the height of the smaller triangle

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.659
and the area

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.141
and we essentially are in the home stretch.

00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:19.355
So let's do that

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:21.341
So these are two similar triangles

00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:33.448
We know that the ratio of C to this diameter right here

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:34.778
What's the length of the diameter?

00:05:34.778 --> 00:05:38.544
The length of the diameter is 2 times the radius

00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.908
This is the radius.

00:05:40.908 --> 00:05:45.270
We know that the ratio, C to two times the radius

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.030
is going to be the same exact thing as the ratio of "h"

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.838
- and we want to make sure we're using the same side -

00:05:53.838 --> 00:05:55.529
to the hypoteneuse of that triangle

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.553
to the ratio of "H" to "A".

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:01.742
And the way we figured that out

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:03.263
we look at corresponding sides.

00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:06.641
"C" and the hypoteneuse are both the sides

00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:08.923
adjacent to this angle right over here

00:06:08.923 --> 00:06:11.647
So you have "H" and "A".

00:06:11.647 --> 00:06:15.405
So "C" is to "2r "as "H" is to "a".

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:19.668
Or, we could do a lot of things.

00:06:19.668 --> 00:06:23.380
1, we could solve for h over here

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.146
and substitute an expression that has the area

00:06:28.146 --> 00:06:30.512
Actually let's just do that

00:06:30.543 --> 00:06:33.811
So if we use this first expression for the area.

00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:39.827
We could multiply both sides by two.

00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:44.711
And divide both sides by B.

00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:47.202
That cancels with that.

00:06:47.202 --> 00:06:50.915
We get that H is equal to 3 times the area over B.

00:06:50.915 --> 00:06:56.992
We can rewrite this relationship as c/2r is equals to h

00:06:56.992 --> 00:07:05.883
which is 2 times the area of our triangle over B

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:12.118
and then all of that is going to be over A.

00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:15.074
Or, we could rewrite that second part over here

00:07:15.074 --> 00:07:20.270
as two times the area over

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.977
- we're dividing by "b" and then divided by "a",

00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:25.777
that's the same thing as dividing by ab

00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:27.169
So we can ignore this right here.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.354
So we have c/2r is equals to 2 times the area over ab

00:07:31.354 --> 00:07:33.966
And now we can cross-multiply

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:49.362
ab times c is going to be equal to 2r times 2abc.

00:07:49.362 --> 00:07:56.060
So that's going to be 4r times the area of our triangle.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.787
I just cross multiply this times this

00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:01.235
is going to be equal to that times that.

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.503
We know that cross multiplication is just

00:08:03.503 --> 00:08:07.320
multiplying both sides of the equation by 2r

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.025
and multiplying both sides of the equation by ab.

00:08:11.025 --> 00:08:12.141
So we did that on the left hand side

00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.607
we also did that on the right hand side

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:15.955
2r and ab

00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:19.097
obviously that cancels with that, that cancels with that

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:22.941
So we get ABC is equal to 2r times 2abc.

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.815
Or 4r times the area of our triangle.

00:08:26.815 --> 00:08:27.991
And now we're in the home stretch.

00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:40.717
We divide both sides of this by 4 times the area

00:08:40.717 --> 00:08:41.752
and we're done.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:43.698
This cancels with that, that cancels with that

00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:45.676
and we have our relationship

00:08:45.676 --> 00:08:50.045
The radius, or we can call it the circumradius.

00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:52.805
The radius of this triangle's circumscribed circle

00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:55.495
is equal to the product of the side of the triangle

00:08:55.495 --> 00:09:03.410
divided by 4 times the area of the triangle.

00:09:03.410 --> 99:59:59.999
That's a pretty neat result.
