00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.520
Write a polynomial to express
the total value of p $20

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.110
bills, q $10 bills,
and r $5 bills.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.180
So what's the value
of p $20 bills?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.090
Well if I have p $20 bills,
the value of each of those

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.890
dollar bills is going
to be $20.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.590
So the value all p of them
is going to be 20p.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.299
If I have one $20
bill, it's $20.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.170
If I have three $20 bills, if p
is 3, it's going to be $60.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.650
Actually, let me do that
in the same color as

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.420
I underlined it.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.630
I underlined it in yellow.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.040
So let me do the p $20 bills.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.640
So 20p is the p $20 bills.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.100
Then you have your
q $10 bills.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.260
So what's the value of those?

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.490
Well it's going to be 10q.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.100
If I have one $10 bill,
it's worth $10.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.410
If I have ten $10 bills, if q
is 10, this is going to be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.560
worth 10 times 10. $100.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.480
And then finally you have your r
$5 bills, which are going to

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.830
be worth 5r dollars.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.120
One $5 bill, worth $5.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.790
Two $5 bills, worth $10.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.610
And we're done.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.240
We've expressed it
as a polynomial.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.090
Polynomial just means that we
have multiple terms here and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.760
this is three terms. We could
even call it a trinomial.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.700
Polynomial is a more general
term for more than one term.
