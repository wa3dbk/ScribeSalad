00:00:00.335 --> 00:00:02.743
We've already talked a lot about plate boundaries

00:00:02.743 --> 00:00:09.546
where essentially new crust material is being created and the plates are actually moving apart -

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:15.336
we call these divergent boundaries, and the example we showed of this was the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:19.199
where essentially new crustal material is being created.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.151
Now, on the other side of the equation you have areas where plates are ramming into each other.

00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.807
We see that over here where the Nazca plate is running into the South American plate.

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:38.466
We see it over here where the Pacific plate is running into the Filipino plate - they're running into each other.

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:43.384
So what happens over there? So what we're gonna do is just go through the different scenarios.

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:48.121
The general idea is that one plate is going to get subducted under another.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:52.446
Tthey're ramming into each other, one is going to get essentially pushed under the other one.

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:55.412
This diagram shows some subduction over here.

00:00:55.412 --> 00:01:00.158
Tthis is essentially an oceanic plate being subducted under another oceanic plate,

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:06.134
so not too different than what might happen when the Pacific plate runs into the Filipino plate

00:01:06.134 --> 00:01:09.954
right over here, then on this side of the diagram

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:18.069
we see an oceanic plate and the oceanic crust getting subducted under a continental plate, right over here.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:24.126
And this is what's happening when the Nazca plate is getting subducted under the South American plate

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.238
and when that happens you have a couple of things

00:01:26.238 --> 00:01:29.383
so you have the oceanic plate being pushed under

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:36.010
and what happens at the same time the continental plate gets pushed upwards causing mountain ranges like The Andes

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.674
and that's exactly what causes - what has created The Andes,

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:46.953
it's the upward force from the Nazca plate being pushed under the South American plate at that coast line.

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:52.956
And what you're also going to see is, and if you can imagine you have these huge plates grinding past each other,

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:59.628
it's not a very smooth process, every now and then you reach a breaking point where hug amount of energy

00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:03.823
get released so you're also going to see a lot of earthquakes in those areas

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.878
and we know that Chile has a lot of earthquakes.

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:10.538
And then on top of that, this is going to result in a lot of heat

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:14.472
and a lot of friction of the plates grinding past each other

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:20.960
essentially allowing magma to form at that part of the rock

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.625
and because it's getting so heated you also have volcanoes in these areas

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:30.829
where essentially something is being subducted underneath a continental plate.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.939
Now, we also talked about what's happening in the Pacific

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.602
where we have the Pacific plate being subducted under the Filipino plate.

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:41.812
That's what we keep referring to over here.

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:44.266
And that's doing a couple of interesting things.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.410
So whenever you have subduction, you have trenches.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.279
But it's most interesting - or at least in my mind

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:54.899
that the deepest trenches have been created where you have an oceanic plate being subducted under another oceanic plate.

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.909
So a couple of things are going to happen.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.087
You're going to have deep trenches form,

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:04.282
over here you see in this diagram we also have a trench and the first example,

00:03:04.282 --> 00:03:08.673
but you have trenches form where one oceanic plate is being subducted under another

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:12.406
and then you have that same type of friction that you saw over here create volcanoes

00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:15.812
and those volcanoes will initially be underwater volcanoes

00:03:15.812 --> 00:03:23.003
since these are both oceanic plates, or we're dealing with oceanic crust at that point of the plate,

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:24.939
it doesn't have to be entirely and oceanic plate,

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.407
and there'll first be underwater volcanoes

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:32.141
but as the lave piles up and hardens, it'll eventually turn into a group of islands.

00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:37.474
And we've had that happening where the Pacific plate runs into the Filipino plate

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.070
and first we have the trench,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.569
let me just draw everything right here.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.491
So, this is the boundary, roughly, roughly speaking

00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.343
this is the boundary between the two plates

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:51.937
the Pacific plate and the Filipino plate right over here.

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:55.320
And where it's being subducted you have the Mariana Trench

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.968
which is the deepest trench in the world!

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:04.151
It goes down 11 km - eleven thousand metres!

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.891
That's deeper than Mount Everest is high.

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.492
Mt Everest is about 9,000 metres high.

00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:12.737
And we'll see that's also due to another convergent plate boundary,

00:04:12.737 --> 00:04:15.288
another plate boundary where plates are running into each other.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:17.736
So not only do you see the Mariana Trench here

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.173
because one plate is being subducted under the other,

00:04:20.173 --> 00:04:22.989
you see the formation of the Mariana Islands

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:25.813
which were essentially created from underwater volcanoes

00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:28.606
because of all of the energy being released.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:34.670
And this is actually a depiction of what's the subduction that's happening at the Mariana Trench.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.066
You have the subduction over here then you have the Mriana Islands being created

00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:42.615
by essentially the energy causing magma and lava,

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:46.383
essentially magma before it surfaces, to flow on the top

00:04:46.383 --> 00:04:49.495
and as lava just goes and starts building these islands.

00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:52.290
Now, the last type of convergent boundary

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.139
is when you have two parts of continetal crust running into each other.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:04.222
So that's the situation that we have when the Indian plate is running into the Euroasian plate,

00:05:04.222 --> 00:05:06.782
I think you might already guess what's going to happen there.

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:09.686
When you have two pieces of continetnal crust running into each other,

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:12.496
one is more or less dense that the other.

00:05:12.496 --> 00:05:15.679
And so at least the crustal portions on them

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.969
are just going keep jamming into each other.

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.018
And so they're just going to push things up.

00:05:22.018 --> 00:05:25.689
This is a depiction righ here that I got from the USGS.

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:31.277
And what's kind of depicting it - this is the Indian plate, this is the Euroasian plate,

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:35.946
this is if you rewind a good bit before they really had the chance to jam into each other.

00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:39.936
But as they're jamming into each other, the Indian plate is kind of digging in a little bit,

00:05:39.936 --> 00:05:43.687
not being fully subducted, and it's causing the land to rise.

00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:49.799
And that essentially ends up with something like the Himalayas.

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:55.483
This right here is a picture of Mount Everest which is almost 9,000 metres high,

00:05:55.483 --> 00:05:58.206
9,000 metres above sea level.

00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:02.206
So, it's almost as high as the Mariana Trench is deep.
