00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:03.808
What I'm going to attempt to do in the next two videos is really just give an overview

00:00:03.808 --> 00:00:08.333
of everything that's happened to Earth since it came into existence.

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:13.468
We're going start really at the formation of Earth or the formation of our Solar system or the formation of

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:17.000
the Sun, and our best sense of what actually happened is that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.733
there was a supernova in our vicinity of the galaxy,

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.475
and this right here is a picture of a supernova remnant,

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.960
actually, the remnant for Kepler's supernova.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.557
The supernova in this picture actually happened four hundred years ago in 1604,

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:34.133
so right at the center a star essentially exploded

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.867
and for a few weeks was the brightest object in the night sky,

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:41.133
and it was observed by Kepler and other people in 1604,

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.733
and this is what it looks like now.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:46.045
What we see is kinda the shockwave that's been traveling

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.876
out for the past 400 years, so now it must be many

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:52.547
light years across. It wasn't, obviously, matter wasn't

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:55.133
traveling at the speed of light, but it must've been traveling

00:00:55.133 --> 00:01:00.209
pretty, pretty fast, at least relativistic speeds, a reasonable

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.206
fraction of the speed of light.

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.133
This has traveled a good bit out now, but what you can

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.600
imagine is when you have the shockwave traveling out from

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.667
a supernova, let's say you had a cloud of molecules,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.600
a cloud of gas, that before the shockwave came by just

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.933
wasn't dense enough for gravity to take over,

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.400
and for it to accrete, essentially, into a solar system.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.467
When the shockwave passes by it compresses all of this gas

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:32.933
and all of this material and all of these molecules, so

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:36.667
it now does have that critical density to form, to accrete

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.533
into a star and a solar system.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.634
We think that's what's happened, and the reason why we

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:46.467
feel pretty strongly that it must've been caused by a supernova

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.714
is that the only way that the really heavy elements can form,

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:52.600
or the only way we know that they can form is in kind of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.867
the heat of a supernova, and our uranium, the uranium that seems

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:02.067
to be in our solar system on Earth, seems to have formed

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:05.467
roughly at the time of the formation of Earth, at about

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:07.547
four and a half billion years ago, and we'll talk

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:10.400
in a little bit more depth in future videos on exactly how

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.600
people figure that out, but since the uranium seems about

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.626
the same age as our solar system, it must've been formed

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:21.133
at around the same time, and it must've been formed by a supernova,

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.801
and it must be coming from a supernova, so a supernova

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:27.267
shockwave must've passed through our part of the universe,

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:31.333
and that's a good reason for gas to get compressed and begin to accrete.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.600
So you fast-forward a few million years.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.867
That gas would've accreted into something like this.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:39.933
It would've reached the critical temperature, critical density

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:43.867
and pressure at the center for ignition to occur, for fusion

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:46.882
to start to happen, for hydrogen to start fusing into helium,

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:52.267
and this right here is our early sun.

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:56.400
Around the sun you have all of the gases and particles

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.467
and molecules that had enough angular velocity to not fall into the sun,

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.333
to go into orbit around the sun.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:04.533
They were actually supported by a little bit of pressure, too,

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:07.667
because you can kinda view this as kind of a big cloud of gas,

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:10.467
so they're always bumping into each other, but for the most part

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:14.400
it was their angular velocity, and over the next tens of millions of years

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.200
they'll slowly bump into each other and clump into each other.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.733
Even small particles have gravity, and they're gonna slowly

00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:26.533
become rocks and asteroids and, eventually, what we would call

00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:30.267
"planetesimals," which are, kinda view them as seeds

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:35.203
of planets or early planets, and then those would have a reasonable amount

00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:37.836
of gravity and other things would be attracted to them

00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.736
and slowly clump up to them.

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.772
This wasn't like a simple process, you know, you could imagine

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:46.600
you might have one planetesimal form, and then there's another

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.800
planetesimal formed, and instead of having a nice, gentle

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.733
those two guys accreting into each other, they might have

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:56.733
huge relative velocities and ram into each other, and then just,

00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:01.733
you know, shatter, so this wasn't just a nice, gentle process of constant accretion.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.533
It would actually have been a very violent process,

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:08.467
actually happened early in Earth's history, and we actually think

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.733
this is why the Moon formed, so at some point

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:15.067
you fast-forward a little bit from this, Earth would have formed,

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:20.400
I should say, the mass that eventually becomes our modern Earth

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.133
would have been forming. Let me draw it over here.

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:28.800
So, let's say that that is our modern Earth, and what we think

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.762
happened is that another proto-planet or another,

00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:34.677
it was actually a planet because it was roughly the size of Mars,

00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:39.800
ran into our, what it is eventually going to become our Earth.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800
This is actually a picture of it.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.867
This is an artist's depiction of that collision, where this planet

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:50.800
right here is the size of Mars, and it ran into what would eventually become Earth.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.600
This we call Theia. This is Theia,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.933
and what we believe happened, and if you look up,

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:01.600
if you go onto the Internet, you'll see some simulations

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.267
that talk about this, is that we think it was a glancing blow.

00:05:04.267 --> 00:05:06.933
It wasn't a direct hit that would've just kinda shattered

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:10.600
each of them and turned into one big molten ball.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.467
We think it was a glancing blow, something like this.

00:05:13.467 --> 00:05:16.933
This was essentially Earth. Obviously, Earth got changed

00:05:16.933 --> 00:05:20.933
dramatically once Theia ran into it, but Theia is

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.133
right over here, and we think it was a glancing blow.

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:27.733
It came and it hit Earth at kind of an angle, and then it

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:31.267
obviously the combined energies from that interaction

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:35.067
would've made both of them molten, and frankly

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:36.887
they probably already were molten because you had

00:05:36.887 --> 00:05:40.267
a bunch of smaller collisions and accretion events and

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:43.200
little things hitting the surface, so probably both of them

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.800
during this entire period, but this would've had a

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.898
glancing blow on Earth and essentially splashed a bunch

00:05:50.898 --> 00:05:53.667
of molten material out into orbit.

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:57.067
It would've just come in, had a glancing blow on Earth,

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:59.733
and then splashed a bunch of molten material,

00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:02.800
some of it would've been captured by Earth, so this is

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.133
the before and the after, you can imagine, Earth is

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:12.800
kind of this molten, super hot ball, and some of it

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.800
just gets splashed into orbit from the collision.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.400
Let me just see if I can draw Theia here, so

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.400
Theia has collided, and it is also molten now because

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800
huge energies, and it splashes some of it into orbit.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.733
If we fast-forward a little bit, this stuff that got splashed

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:37.800
into orbit, it's going in that direction, that becomes

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.600
our Moon, and then the rest of this material eventually

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.000
kind of condenses back into a spherical shape and is what

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.933
we now call our Earth.

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.133
So that's how we actually think right now that the Moon

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.733
actually formed.

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:58.000
Even after this happened, the Earth still had a lot more,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.467
I guess, violence to experience.

00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:04.533
Just to get a sense of where we are in the history of Earth,

00:07:04.533 --> 00:07:09.000
we're going to refer to this time clock a lot over the next few videos,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.867
this time clock starts right here at the formation of our solar system,

00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:16.600
4.6 billion years ago, probably coinciding with

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.200
some type of supernova,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.800
and as we go clockwise on this diagram,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.067
we're moving forward in time, and we're gonna go

00:07:24.067 --> 00:07:26.800
all the way forward to the present period,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.267
and just so you understand some of the terminology,

00:07:29.267 --> 00:07:32.267
"Ga" means "billions of years ago"

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:33.133
'G' for "Giga-"

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:35.733
"Ma" means "millions of years ago"

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:37.467
'M' for "Mega-"

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.733
So where we are right now, the Moon has formed,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:42.533
and we're in what we call the Hadean period

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:44.000
or actually I shouldn't say "period."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.733
It's the Hadean eon of Earth.

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:48.200
"Period" is actually another time period,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.533
so let me make this very clear. It's the Hadean,

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:57.133
we are in the Hadean eon, and an eon is kind of

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.800
the largest period of time that we talk about, especially

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.800
relative to Earth, and it's roughly 500 million to a billion years

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.133
is an eon, and what makes the Hadean eon distinctive,

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:12.200
well, from a geological point of view what makes it

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.467
distinctive is really we don't have any rocks from the

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:17.733
Hadean period. We don't have any kind of macroscopic-scale

00:08:17.733 --> 00:08:19.800
rocks from the Hadean period, and that's because

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.000
at that time, we believe, the Earth was just this molten

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.267
ball of kind of magma and lava, and it was molten

00:08:29.267 --> 00:08:31.733
because it was a product of all of these accretion events

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:35.600
and all of these collisions and all this kinetic energy turning into heat.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.133
If you were to look at the surface of the Earth,

00:08:38.133 --> 00:08:40.133
if you were to be on the surface of the Earth during

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:43.800
the Hadean eon, which you probably wouldn't want to be

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.333
because you might get hit by a falling meteorite

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:48.133
or probably burned by some magma, whatever,

00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.333
it would look like this, and you wouldn't be able to breathe anyway;

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:53.067
this is what the surface of the Earth would look like.

00:08:53.067 --> 00:08:55.933
It would look like a big magma pool, and that's why we

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:57.800
don't have any rocks from there because the rocks were

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.733
just constantly being recycled, being dissolved and churned

00:09:03.733 --> 00:09:07.467
inside of this giant molten ball, and frankly

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:10.533
the Earth still is a giant molten ball, it's just

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:14.600
we live on the super-thin, cooled crust of that molten ball.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.202
If you go right below that crust, and we'll talk a little bit more

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:18.025
about that in future videos,

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:21.533
you will get magma, and if you go dig deeper,

00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:23.067
you'll have liquid iron.

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:26.133
I mean, it still is a molten ball.

00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:27.800
And this whole period is just a violent,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.400
not only was Earth itself a volcanic, molten ball,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.933
it began to harden as you get into the late Hadean eon,

00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:39.959
but we also had stuff falling from the sky and constantly

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:42.723
colliding with Earth, and really just continuing to add

00:09:42.723 --> 00:09:45.800
to the heat of this molten ball.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.600
Anyway, I'll leave you there,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.733
and, as you can imagine,

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:50.200
at this point there was no, as far as we can tell,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.733
there was no life on Earth.

00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:54.533
Some people believe that maybe some life could've formed

00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:57.667
in the late Hadean eon, but for the most part

00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:01.267
this was just completely inhospitable for any life forming.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.000
I'll leave you there, and where we take up the next video,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.369
we'll talk a little bit about the Archean eon.
