00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.500
In the video on sp3 hybridized
orbitals, we went in pretty

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.910
good detail about how a methane
molecule looks.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.590
But just as a bit of a review,
it's the tetrahedral shape.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.970
You have a carbon in the middle,
and then you would

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.870
have a hydrogen-- you can
imagine I'm drawing it like

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.580
this because this hydrogen is
poking out of the page.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.780
Then maybe you have another
hydrogen that's in the page.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.640
You have one above the carbon,
and you have one

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.630
that's behind the page.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.760
You could imagine it's like a
tripod with a pole sticking

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.409
out of the top of the tripod.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.690
Or if you were to imagine the
shape another way, if you were

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.140
to connect the hydrogens, you
would have a four-sided

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.530
pyramid with a triangle
as each of the sides.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.230
So it would to look something
like this.

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:53.320
I'm trying my best to draw--
the pyramid would look

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.060
something like this if you
could see through it.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.780
So this would be one side,
another side would be over

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.685
here, and then the backside
would be over here, and then

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.170
the fourth side is actually
the side that's

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.430
transparent out front.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.970
So the fourth side would be the
actual kind of thing that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.790
we're looking through when
we look at this pyramid.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.610
It would be this front
side right over here.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.910
So you can imagine it different
ways, this was the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.160
case with methane.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.590
Now let's extend this into
a slightly more complex

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.400
molecule, and that's ethane.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.710
So the way we've been drawing
it so far-- I guess the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.260
simplest way to draw ethane,
is just like that.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.580
By implication this is ethane.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.810
By implication you have a carbon
there, and a carbon

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.010
there, and they'll each have
three hydrogens bonded to it.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.310
And we've drawn it something
like this.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.150
Three hydrogens bonded to
each of these guys.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.240
But now we know that carbon
has these sp3 hybridized

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.970
orbitals, that it likes to form
more of a tetrahedral

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.780
shape when it bonds.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.550
So an ethane molecule would
actually look more like this.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.270
Let me draw the carbons.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.810
So I'll do the carbons
in orange.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.030
So if that's the carbon
and that's the carbon.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.759
So you can imagine you have
a carbon molecule here.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.710
I'll draw it as this
little circle.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.370
And then if we have some
perspective, so the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.350
carbon-carbon bond is going
to look like that.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.520
And then you have
another carbon

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.150
molecule right over there.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.160
So that's that bond over here.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.880
And we want both the carbons,
all of their bonds to be kind

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.820
of in a tetrahedral shape.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.870
So then you could imagine
this bond over

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.826
here going like this.

00:02:31.826 --> 00:02:33.630
This bond going like that.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690
And you have your hydrogen
at the end.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.210
Let's make the green circles
the hydrogens.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.180
So you have that hydrogen, and
then-- or actually just the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.900
circles, we'll call them
hydrogen-- and then you can

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.970
imagine this one, maybe it's
coming out of the page a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.510
little bit.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.760
That is that hydrogen.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.030
Let me label the hydrogens,
actually.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.470
I'm doing it in all different
colors so you can see what I'm

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.900
talking about.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.920
And then this hydrogen is going
right below it, maybe

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.200
pointed back a little bit.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.370
So that hydrogen is
right over there.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.380
So you can see this carbon,
its bonds have

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.470
a tetrahedral shape.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.960
Or, if you just looked at this
part of it, these would be the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.630
base of the tripod and
this would be the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.580
thing sticking up.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.350
Now for this carbon it would
be very similar idea.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.990
This hydrogen right
here, might be

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.240
sticking down like this.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.460
And I'll stop switching
colors soon enough.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.230
It takes a lot of time.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.100
That hydrogen over there, it's
pointing out in that

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.870
direction like that.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.850
And then you would have,
let's see what

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.820
colors do I have left?

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.180
Well, I'll just do yellow.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.610
That hydrogen right
there, maybe it's

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.110
pointing out like that.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.030
So this is a possible
configuration for ethane.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.220
And the way that I've drawn this
right now, and you can

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.010
actually have a model that has
this, where you have little

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.050
wooden sticks with balls and
this, the balls to represent

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.100
the actual atoms, this is called
a ball and stick model.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.140
And this is a ball and stick
model for ethane.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.490
Now a simpler way we could
have drawn this, this is

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.100
called a horse shoe projection--
or actually it's

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.310
a sawhorse production.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.450
I always say horse shoe.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.290
A sawhorse projection.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.230
It would look like this.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.060
This exact same configuration
of ethane in a sawhorse

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.110
projection.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.330
And you know what a sawhorse
looks like, well, it looks

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.130
like what I'm about to draw.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.520
It looks like this.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.720
So you could, well I could
draw it exactly the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.760
way I drew it here.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.280
So you have the carbon, carbon,
and then you have the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.910
hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen,
and then you have a-- well,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.310
the way I've drawn it up
here is more like this.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.850
Just so we see the parallel
and then we can

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.240
rotate things around.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.690
The way I drew it up here,
you have a hydrogen,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.810
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.340
And then over here you
have a hydrogen,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.020
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.830
This is a sawhorse projection.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.290
Now, either way you depict
it, I mean, these are

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.030
really the same way.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.650
This is kind of just like
the lazier way of

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.550
doing it on some level.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.620
You're not drawing all of these
circles and all of that,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.680
and you're putting a little
less care into actually

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.130
showing the angle, how things
are angled away from the

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.010
carbon and showing the
tetrahedral shape.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.885
But in either case, when you
start visualizing the molecule

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:24.510
in this way, you start to
realize there's, well, there's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.430
actually infinite ways that
these things can be

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.110
configured.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.370
And it all comes from the notion
that this is just a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.700
sigma bond right here.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.690
We learned that in the video on
sp3 hybridization and sigma

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.890
and pi bonds.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.030
This is just a sigma bond.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.250
And so we can rotate
around the bonds.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.930
One of these carbons could
rotate around the axis of that

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.150
bond without the other
carbon having to

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.240
necessarily rotate with it.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.760
If this was a double bond, if
this was a pi bond, they would

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.280
have to rotate together.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.230
So you could have a situation
like I've drawn here or you

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.490
could have a situation where
they're kind of rotated the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.380
inverse of each other.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.570
And this is what I mean.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.210
So I'll do a ball and stick.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.760
So let's say this is our front
carbon, that is our back

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.080
carbon, and we'll compare it
to this one over here.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.710
So let me draw this guy
the exact same way.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.900
So he's got a hydrogen down
here, he's got a hydrogen up

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.890
there, and then he's got
a hydrogen up here.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.510
So that part of the ethane
looks identical.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.410
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to flip the other

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.240
side of the ethane.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.850
I want you to pay close
attention, because hopefully

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.310
you'll see the difference
between the two.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.440
So instead of doing this blue
ethane down here-- this blue

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.610
hydrogen down here-- I'm
going to do it on top.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.310
So this blue one, I want to
do that in blue, this blue

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.280
hydrogen, put it on top.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.720
So I'm just rotating
this around.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.850
So the blue hydrogen's on top.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.950
So I've rotated it so the
blue one's on top now.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.710
And now the green one is
going to go over here.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.060
So now the green hydrogen
is now over here.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.310
And then this purple, or this
magenta hydrogen, the way I've

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.010
rotated it, is now going
to go over here.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.680
So what's the difference between
this configuration and

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.830
this configuration right here?

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.870
And we could have
had every other

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.040
configuration in between.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.700
But what's the real
difference here?

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.260
Well, here the hydrogen, you
could imagine that hydrogen is

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.510
kind of, if you were looking
from that direction, that

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.890
hydrogen is directly behind that
hydrogen, that hydrogen

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.060
is directly behind that
hydrogen, that hydrogen is

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.360
directly behind that.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.740
This is called an eclipsed
configuration, or eclipsed

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.160
conformation.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:43.340
So eclipsed conformation.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.620
And this right here, nothing
is behind anything.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.380
If you went straight
back from this guy,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.140
you'd get to this point.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.010
And no one's behind it.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.470
And if you went straight forward
from this guy you'll

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.850
get-- So in no way are any of
the guys in the back-- once

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.750
again, if your viewing from
this direction-- are they

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.400
blocked by any of
the people here.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.965
So we call this a staggered
conformation.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.670
Now, why do we even care?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.190
OK, I can twist around
this back molecule.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.890
What's that even going to do for
our actual-- why does it

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.530
even matter?

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.500
Well, one, it's just interesting
that you can

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.720
actually change, that this thing
can twist around without

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.870
changing the front-- without the
front molecule having to

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:30.940
twist with it.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.600
But even more important, these
have different energy levels,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.590
so you can kind of think of
them as you're kind of

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.630
twisting a spring and the spring
might want to go back

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.610
to one conformation
or another.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.760
And to visualize it a little
better, I'll draw what's

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.580
called a Newman Projection.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.150
So I'm going to draw this exact
thing, but with a Newman

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.790
Projection, you draw the carbon
molecules directly in

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.890
front or directly behind
each other.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.570
So in this situation, you would
draw the carbon molecule

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.040
in front, would just be the
intersection of these bonds.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.640
So for a Newman Projection--
let me draw that out.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.320
So it's a Newman Projection and
I'll start with the Newman

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.290
Projection for the staggered
conformation.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.460
So in the front-- we'll consider
this carbon the front

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.340
carbon-- we have our
hydrogen pointing

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.095
straight down like that.

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:31.700
And we have a hydrogen
coming out to the

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.420
top left, like that.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.020
And then we have this
hydrogen over here

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.380
coming up to the right.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.400
I want to do that in
that same color.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.010
So the front carbon is
implicitly at the intersection

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.060
of the bonds of these
three hydrogens.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.260
And then the back carbon-- I
said the front carbon is the

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.490
intersection of the bonds of
these three hydrogens-- the

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.480
back carbon you represented
as a circle.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.680
So the circle represents
the back of carbon.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.740
The front carbon is kind
of that point there.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.680
This is a way of
visualizing it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.990
But if we were to draw it this
way, the back carbon now has

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.520
that blue hydrogen popping
off of it.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:19.580
So it has that blue hydrogen,
this green hydrogen, and then

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:20.830
this magenta hydrogen.

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.300
And when you look at it like
this, it is more clear that

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:26.830
it's staggered.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.820
We're just looking straight on
to this ethane molecule.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.520
When we look straight on, the
front carbon, they're

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.880
obviously blocking each other.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.370
But this way you can see the
front carbon's hydrogens are

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.020
staggered relative
to the back ones.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.230
So this is right here, once
again, this is staggered.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.600
Now let's draw the eclipsed
conformation as a Newman

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.720
Projection.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.450
So as a Newman Projection
the front's

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.390
going to look the same.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:53.860
You have a hydrogen there, you
have this hydrogen, you have

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.800
that hydrogen, and then you
have that blue, or I guess

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.820
that purple hydrogen,
down here.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.270
So that's the front of it.

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.750
But the back, they're
right behind it's.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.260
So let me draw the
back carbon.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.590
The front carbon is kind of
represented by just that dot.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:11.020
The back carbon we'll
represent like that.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.770
And the staggered conformation,
if this guy's

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.280
really behind that, you're going
to have to draw it like,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.070
right there, like
right behind it.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.100
But since that's a little bit
messy, normally when people

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.780
draw a staggered projection-- an
eclipsed conformation, as a

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.270
Newman Projection.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.910
Instead of directly eclipsing
that last, that back hydrogen,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.720
they'll put it to the right a
little, or they'll push it off

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.500
a little bit.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.010
So that's that hydrogen.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.450
That magenta hydrogen
is right there.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.790
It's really right behind the
front one, but this is just so

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.590
you can actually see
that it's there.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.210
And then finally you have this
blue one down there.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.590
So that blue one is going
to be right over here.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:57.690
So this is the eclipsed
conformation as a Newman

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:58.940
Projection.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.290
And as you can see,
it's eclipsed.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.280
The back hydrogens are eclipsed
by the front ones.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.700
If I were to draw it perfectly,
they would be

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700
right behind it.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.510
Now there's one other piece of,
I guess one more idea, I

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.250
want to introduce you to, and
that's the notion of the angle

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.040
between the different
hydrogens.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.690
So if you wanted to say, well,
what is this angle?

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.690
What is this angle between the
blue hydrogen and this pink

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.770
hydrogen right here?

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.720
Now, when you actually think
of it in three dimensions,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.340
it's like, wow, you can't really
say the angle over here

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.350
between blue and the pink.

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.840
But on a Newman Projection, when
you're just saying how

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.560
much are they rotated away from
each other, this angle

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.130
right here is called
a dihedral angle.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.200
Sometimes it's just said, you
know, this hydrogen relative

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.160
to that hydrogen has a DA of,
in this case, 60 degrees.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.120
In this case, this hydrogen
relative to that hydrogen has

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.970
a dihedral angle of
zero degrees.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.740
And it's a way of saying,
how staggered, or how

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.920
eclipsed, you are.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.990
Now, one last thing I touched on
the idea, so again, why do

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.250
we even care?

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.230
Well, all of these hydrogens
have electron clouds around

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.650
them, and all of these
bonds have electron

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.270
clouds around them.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.960
And electron clouds, they're all
negative, so they want to

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.140
get as far away from each
other as possible.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.580
And they're all stable now,
because they've bonded in ways

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.090
that they have nice
stable structures.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.890
Everyone feels like they
have full valence

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.820
shells, full orbitals.

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.100
And so the electron
clouds want to get

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.440
away from each other.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:31.560
Now in this situation, in the
eclipsed conformation, this

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.190
hydrogen and this hydrogen--
let me do it in-- this

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:40.050
hydrogen and this hydrogen are
closer to each other than when

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.680
you go to the staggered
conformation.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.070
The staggered conformation, the
closest hydrogen to this

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.960
guy is going to be either that
hydrogen or that hydrogen.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.300
But they're both further away
than this hydrogen was in the

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.720
eclipsed conformation.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.060
So in general, the staggered
conformation is going to be

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.020
more stable.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.920
It's going to have a lower
potential energy.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.990
You can imagine that if you
start with an eclipsed

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.910
conformation, these guys are all
going to want to get away

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.010
from each other.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.900
So it's kind of like this is
the wound conformation.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.300
It has higher potential
energy.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.300
So it'll want to unwind and
it'll want to unwind to a

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.580
staggered conformation, because
in this conformation,

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.640
all of the hydrogens
have gotten as far

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.890
away from each other.
