00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.450
We're asked to solve for y.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.750
So we're told that the negative
of the cube root of y

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.770
is equal to 4 times the
cube root of y plus 5.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.790
So in all of these it's helpful
to just be able to

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.400
isolate the cube root, isolate
the radical in the equation,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.270
and then solve from there.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.960
So let's see if we can
isolate the radical.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.360
So the simplest thing to do, if
we want all of the radical

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.750
onto the left-hand side
equation, we can subtract 4

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.355
times the cube root of y from
both sides of this equation.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:33.570
So let's subtract 4.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.280
We want to subtract 4 times the
cube root of y from both

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.530
sides of this equation.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.110
And so your left-hand side, you
already have negative 1

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.600
times the cube root of y, and
you're going to subtract 4

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.480
more of the cube root of y.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.610
So you're going to have
negative 5 times the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.130
cube root of y.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.690
That's your left-hand side.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.420
Now the right-hand side-- these
two guys-- cancel out.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.220
That was the whole point behind
subtracting this value.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.880
So that cancels out and you're
just left with a 5 there.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.460
You're just left with this
5 right over there.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.855
Now, we've almost isolated
this cube root of y.

00:01:16.855 --> 00:01:18.900
We just have to divide both
sides of the equation by

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600
negative 5.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.220
So you just divide both
sides of this

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.330
equation by negative 5.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.620
And these cancel out.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.700
That was the whole point.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.460
And we are left with the cube
root of y is equal to-- 5

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.920
divided by negative
5 is negative 1.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.570
Now, the cube root of y is
equal to negative 1.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.440
Well the easiest way to solve
this is, let's take both sides

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.420
of this equation to
the third power.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.810
This statement right here is
the exact same statement as

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.840
saying y to the 1/3 is
equal to negative 1.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.330
These are just two
different ways of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.240
writing the same thing.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.970
This is equivalent to taking
the 1/3 power.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.150
So if we take both sides of
this equation to the third

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.160
power, that's like taking both
sides of this equation to the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.410
third power.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.390
And you can see here, y to the
1/3 to the third-- y to the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.760
1/3 and then to the third,
that's like saying y to the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.830
1/3 times 3 power.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.320
Or y to the first power.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520
That's the whole point of it.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.840
If you take the cube root of y
to the third power, that's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.580
just going to be y.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.610
So the left-hand
side becomes y.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.190
And then the right-hand side,
what's negative 1

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.850
to the third power?

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.700
Negative 1 times negative
1 is 1.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.950
Times negative 1 again
is negative 1.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.790
So we get y is equal to negative
1 as our solution.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.460
Now let's make sure that
it actually works.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.395
Let's go back to our
original equation.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:49.170
And I'll put negative
1 in for our y's.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.550
We had the negative of the
cube root of-- this time,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.510
negative 1-- has to be equal
to 4 times the cube root of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.560
negative 1 plus 5.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.750
Let's verify that this
is the case.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.210
The cube root of negative
1 is negative 1.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.770
Negative 1 to the third
power is negative 1.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.230
So this is equal to the negative
of negative 1 has to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.110
be equal to 4 times-- the cube
root of negative 1 is

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.870
negative 1 plus 5.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.330
The negative of negative
1 is just positive 1.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.120
So 1 needs to be equal to--
4 times negative 1,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.070
negative 4, plus 5.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.110
This is true.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.260
Negative 4 plus 5 is 1.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.420
So this works out.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.490
This is our solution.
