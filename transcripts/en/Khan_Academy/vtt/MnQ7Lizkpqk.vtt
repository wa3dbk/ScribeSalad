00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.080
What is the nth number in
the following sequence?

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.400
Let's see.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.620
The first term here is a 6.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.990
So over here I'll
put the term.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.760
So this is the number.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.080
I'll just write num there.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.260
That's the number.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.970
And this is the term.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.820
So the first term here is a 6.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.060
It looks like we add 3 to
that to get to a 9.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.410
Or maybe there's some
other pattern here.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.250
So that's the second
term, is 9.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.350
Then they go from 9 to 12.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.740
Looks like we add 3 again.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.480
So we keep adding 3.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.400
So the third term is 12,
the fourth term is 15.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.170
And we need to think of a
general expression that will

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.310
give us the value
of the nth term.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.555
The nth number in the
following sequence.

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:46.210
So let's think a little
bit about it.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.500
We know that we're incrementing
by 3 every time

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.460
and we're starting at 6.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880
So let's write these in terms
of multiples of 3, since we

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.200
know that that's the
increment level.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.480
This first term right
here is 3 times 2.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.360
The second term right
here is 3 times 3.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.290
This third term is 3 times 4.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.270
And so it looks like it's 3
times one more than the actual

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.710
term you are dealing with.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.000
Right?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.120
Here, if you take your term,
you add 1 and then multiply

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.530
that by 3, you get 6.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.660
Take your term, add 1, then
multiply it by 3.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.200
Take your term, add
1, you get 4.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.300
Then multiply by 3.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.960
Take your term, add 1-- which
would be 5-- and then multiply

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.480
by 3, you get 15.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.660
So it looks like any time-- so
if you have your nth term.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.920
So if you go all the way out
here to your nth term, the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.050
value here would be
you'd add 1 to it.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.290
So you'd have n plus 1, and then
you'd multiply that by 3.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.080
So the nth term is
3 times n plus 1.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.470
Or if you wanted to distribute
out the 3, it'd be 3n plus 3.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.790
And just make sure that
works for all of them.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.600
The first term, 3 times 1
is 3 plus 3, that works.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.250
That's 6.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.140
The second term, 3 times
2 plus 3 is 9.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.480
So it works for all
of these terms. So

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.630
that is the nth term.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.530
We have to assume that this
pattern continues.
