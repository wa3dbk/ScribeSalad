00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.880
In the first video
on evolution, I

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.890
drew something that
I called an ape.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.562
And then I drew a tail on it.

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:09.020
And what I want to
do in this video

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.340
is clarify that that
was absolutely wrong.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.700
Apes have no tails.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.890
And it's actually one of
the main distinguishing

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.670
characteristics of apes.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.240
There's obviously other primates
that also have no tails.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
But apes definitely
have no tails.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.070
And just to clarify,
there's kind

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.610
of two families within apes.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.090
And their common names are the
lesser apes and the great apes.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.010
And the lesser apes are
things like gibbons.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.720
And the great apes are
things like chimpanzees,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.300
and gorillas, and
me, human beings.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.170
So these right here,
these are the great apes.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.860
And clearly, this
great ape right here,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.860
did not have a great
sense of style in 1994.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.400
And really didn't feel the
need to have a haircut.
