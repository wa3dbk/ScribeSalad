00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:01.785
- [Voiceover] So in the last video

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:04.942
I described how to interpret
three dimensional graphs

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:07.142
and I have another three
dimensional graph here,

00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:08.804
it's a very bumpy guy.

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:12.971
And this happens to be the graph
with the function f of x, y

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.796
is equal to cosine of x

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.669
multiplied by the sine of y

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.610
and you know I could also say like,

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.430
that this graph represents

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.101
I could also say that
this graph represents

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.820
z is equal to that whole value

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.300
because we think about
the output of the function

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.522
as the z coordinate of each point

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.498
and what I want to do here is describe

00:00:41.498 --> 00:00:44.447
how you can interpret the
relationship between this graph

00:00:44.447 --> 00:00:47.197
and these functions that you know

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:50.055
by taking slices of it.

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.657
So for example let's say
that we took a slice with

00:00:53.657 --> 00:00:55.326
this plane here

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:57.552
and what this plane here is

00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:01.135
is it represents the value x equals zero

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:06.701
and you can kinda see that
because this is the x-axis.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:10.047
So when you're at zero on the x-axis

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:11.431
you know, you pass through the origin

00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:13.932
and then the values of
y and z can go freely

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:15.432
so you end up with

00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:17.918
this plane.

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.699
And let's say you want to just consider

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:22.590
where this cuts through the graph, okay,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.971
so we'll limit our graph

00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:25.588
just down to the point where it cuts it

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:28.815
and I'm going to draw a little
red line over that spot.

00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:30.162
Now what you might notice here

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:33.030
that red line looks like a sinusoidal wave

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.955
in fact it looks exactly
like the sine function itself

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:37.421
you know, passes through the origin

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.758
it starts by going up and this makes sense

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:42.709
if we start to plug things into

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.452
the original form here.

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:47.035
Because if you take

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.864
f and you plug in x equals zero

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:54.846
but then we still let y range freely

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:59.492
what it means is that you're
looking at cosine of zero

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:01.409
multiplied by sine of y

00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.014
And what is cosine of zero?

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.015
cosine of zero evaluates to one

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.995
so this whole function should
look just like sine of y

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:17.389
in that when we let y run freely

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.119
the output, which is still
represented by the z coordinate,

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.920
will give us this graph that's just a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.597
normal two-dimensional graph

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:26.679
that we're probably familiar with.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.319
And let's try this at a different point.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.209
Let's see what would happen if

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.091
instead of plugging in x equals zero

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.924
let's imagine that we
plugged in y equals zero

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.524
and this time before I graph it

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:43.670
and before I show everything that goes on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.769
let's just try to figure out

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.734
purely from the formula here

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.789
what it's going to look like
when we plug in y equals zero.

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.013
So now I'm going to write
over on the other side.

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:54.245
We have

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:56.862
f of x will still run freely

00:02:56.862 --> 00:02:59.183
y is going to be fixed as zero

00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:01.610
and what this means is we have cosine of x

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.881
so maybe expect to see something

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.368
that looks kinda like a cosine graph

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.201
and then sine of zero.

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:11.541
Except, what is sine of zero?

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.980
Sine of zero cancels out
and just becomes zero

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.567
which multiplied by cosine of x

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:20.059
means everything cancels
out and becomes zero

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:21.309
so what you'd expect is that this

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:23.127
is going to look like a constant function

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:25.031
that's constantly equal to zero.

00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:26.633
And let's see if that's what we get.

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:28.363
So I'm going to slice it with

00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:29.863
y equals zero here

00:03:31.045 --> 00:03:33.054
and you look at the y axis

00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:34.224
we see when it's zero

00:03:34.224 --> 00:03:35.970
and x and z both run freely.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.042
I'm going to chop off
my graph at that point,

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.830
and indeed it chops it
just at this straight line,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.997
the straight line that goes
right along the x-axis.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.292
But let's say that we did a
different constant value of y.

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:54.459
Rather than y equals zero,

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.573
and we'll erase all of this,

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.823
let's say that I cut things

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.794
at some other value.

00:04:06.794 --> 00:04:09.461
So in this case what I've chosen

00:04:10.323 --> 00:04:12.490
is y is equal to pi halves

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:16.467
and it looks

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:20.819
kinda like we've got a wave here

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.281
and it looks like a cosine wave

00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.800
and you can probably
see where this is going.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.651
This is when x is running freely

00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.066
and if we start to
imagine plugging this in

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.329
I'll just actually write it out.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.593
We've got cosine of x

00:04:34.593 --> 00:04:38.760
and then y is held at a
constant sine of pi halves.

00:04:39.832 --> 00:04:42.499
Sine of pi halves is just,

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.241
this just always equals one

00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:45.645
so we could replace this with one

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:46.876
which means the function as a whole

00:04:46.876 --> 00:04:48.710
should look like cosine x.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.989
So again the multi-variable function

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:52.843
we've frozen y and we're
letting x range freely

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:55.593
and it ends up looking
like a cosine function

00:04:55.593 --> 00:04:58.356
and I think a really
good way to understand

00:04:58.356 --> 00:05:01.395
a given three-dimensional
graph when you see it,

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:02.562
let's say you,

00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.092
you look back at the original graph

00:05:06.092 --> 00:05:08.170
when we don't have anything going on.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.306
Get rid of that little line.

00:05:09.306 --> 00:05:10.246
So you've got this graph

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:11.583
and it looks wavy and bumpy

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:13.534
and a little bit hard
to understand at first

00:05:13.534 --> 00:05:15.269
but if you just think in terms of

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:17.063
holding one variable constant

00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:19.725
it boils down always into

00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:21.315
a normal two-dimensional graph

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:22.450
and you can even think about,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.911
as you're lighting planes,
kinda slide back and forth

00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:26.119
what that means for the

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:29.417
amplitude of the wave that you see

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:30.734
and things like that.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:32.701
This become especially
important, by the way,

00:05:32.701 --> 00:05:36.868
when we introduce a notion
of partial derivatives.
