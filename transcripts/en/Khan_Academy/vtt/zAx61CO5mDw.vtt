00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.630
Let's say we have some object that's moving in a circular path

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's say this is the center of the object path, the center of the circle

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.880
So the object is moving in a circular path that looks something like that

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.600
counterclockwise circular path--you could do that with clockwise as well

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.010
I want to think about how fast it is spinning or orbiting around this center

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.930
how that relates to its velocity?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.290
So let's say that this thing right over here is making five revolutions every second

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.880
So in 1 second, 1 2 3 4 5. Every second it's making 5 revolutions

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.700
So how could we relate that to how many radians it is doing per second?

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.660
Remember radians is just one way to measure angles

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.710
You could do with how degrees per second

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.590
If we do it with radians, we know that each revolution is 2 pi radians

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.340
If you go all the way around a circle, you have gone 2 pi radians

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.800
which is really just you say you've gone 2 pi radii, whatever the radius of the circle is

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.120
and that's where actually the definition of the radian comes from

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:30.000
So if you go 5 revolutions per second and they're 2 pi per revolution

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.350
then you can do a little bit of dimensional analysis. These cancel out

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.450
and you get 5 times 2 pi which gets us to 5 times 2 pi gets us 10 pi

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.760
radians per second

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.200
And it works out the dimensional analysis and hopefully it also makes sense to you intuitively

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.640
If you're doing five revolution a second, each of those revolutions is 2 pi radians

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.030
so you're doing 10 pi radians per second. You're going

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.150
1 2 3 4 5, so that gives us 10, or 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi 2 pi radians

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.550
every time, you're doing it five times a second. So you're doing it 10 pi radians per second

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.730
So this right here, either five revs per second or 10 pi radians per second

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.990
they're both essentially measuring the same thing

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.990
how fast are you orbiting around this central point?

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.020
And this measure of how fast you're orbiting around a central point

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.830
is called angular velocity

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.460
It's called angular velocity because if you think about it

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.360
this is telling us how fast is our angle changing, or speed of angle changing

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.280
When you're dealing with it in two dimensions and this is

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.260
typically when in a recent early physics course how we do deal with it

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.230
Even though it's called the angular velocity

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.020
it tends to be treated as angular speed

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.870
It actually is a vector quantity

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.360
and it's a little unintuitive that the vector's actually popping out of the page

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.860
for this. It's actually a pseudo-vector and we'll talk more about that in the future

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.580
So it is a vector quantity and the direction of the vector

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.580
is dependant on which way it's spinning. So for example

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.200
when it's spinning in a counterclockwise direction

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.530
there is a vector, the real angular vector does pop out of the page

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.700
We start thinking about operating in three dimensions

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.760
And if it's going clockwise, the angular velocity vector would pop into the page

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.220
The way you think about that, right-hand rule

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.260
Curl your fingers of your right hand in the direction that it's spinning

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.380
and then your thumb is essentially pointing in the direction that

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.610
the actual vector or the pseudo-vector's gonna going

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.480
We'll not think too much about that

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.500
For our purposes, when we're just thinking about two-dimensional plane right over here

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:49.320
we can really think of an angular velocity as a--the official term is a pseudo-scaler

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.820
but we can include that as a scaler quantity, as long as we do specify which way it is rotating

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.040
So this right over here, this 10 pi radians per second

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.810
we could call this its angular velocity

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.300
And this tends to be denoted by an omega

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.370
a lower case omega right there

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.250
Upper case omega looks like this

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.430
So there's a couple of ways you could think about it

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:25.220
You could say angular velocity is equal to change in angle over a change in time

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.290
So for example, this is telling us 10 pi radians per second

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:41.820
Or if you want to do in the calculus sense and take instantaneous angular velocity

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.510
it would be the derivative of your angle with respect to time

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.950
How the angle is changing with respect to time

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.100
With that out of the way, I want to see if we can see how this relates to speed

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.460
How does this relate to the actual speed of the object?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.910
So to get the speed of the object, we just have to think about how far is this object traveling

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.200
every revolution that it's doing

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.000
And what we can do right over here--let's say that this radius is r

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.760
So in every revolution, it is traveling 2 pi r

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.080
Let's say this is r meters. Give ourselves some units right over there

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:33.270
So the circumference over here is going to be 2 pi r meters

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:55.530
Let's say that the angular velocity is equal to omega radians per second

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.760
And so how many revolutions is that per second?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.450
We can go backwards from what we did over here

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.710
We have one revolution is equal to 2 pi radians

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.940
Just to be clear, sometimes angular velocity is actually measured in revolutions per second

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.640
but the SI unit is in radians per second

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.040
So here I want to convert omega from radians per second into revolutions per second

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:32.670
Radians cancel out. We are left with--we get omega over 2 pi revolutions per second

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.600
We know how many meters we get for a revolution

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.520
We have 2 pi r meters per revolutions

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.980
So we copy and paste this

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.780
So our angular velocity, if we want revolutions per second

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.970
it's going to be omega over 2 pi revolutions per second

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.960
Omega is in radians per second if we put it into revolutions per second

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.560
omega / 2 pi revolutions per second

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.310
And then let's multiply that times--we want to convert this into meters per second

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.040
So how many meters do we have per revolution?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:17.720
Well, we're gonna travel a whole circumference per revolution, so 2 pi r meters per revolution

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.680
So these two cancel out

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.990
2 pi cancels out with the 2 pi

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:36.130
So you end up getting omega times r meters per second

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.720
And just like that, we have the magnitude of the velocity

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.750
or we could say the speed of the object as it goes around in a circle

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.720
So what we can say is the magnitude of the velocity--

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.460
I'll specify that by v--I want to be clear. This is not vector

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.320
quantity. It's not the velocity. It's the magnitude of velocity

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.910
Or we can say this is the speed. It's going to be equal to omega times r

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:08.070
So the speed is equal to the angular velocity times r

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:14.030
I guess we could say the magnitude of the angular velocity times the radius

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.150
I don't want you to be confused. I am not saying that this is a vector quantity

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.460
If this was a vector, I would put an arrow right over there

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.240
And if this was a vector, I would put an arrow over there

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.560
then I'll be referring to the thing that's popping out of the page

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.450
but here I'm talking about the magnitude of the angular velocity

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:42.670
and so writing in words, you get speed is equal to angular velocity--

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:49.610
if you want to be particular, this is the magnitude of the angular velocity--

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.870
times the radius of the circle that you are going around

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.640
and if you want to solve for angular velocity

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.540
you divide both sides by radius and you get angular velocity

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:14.880
Omega is equal to speed which we're using v for, divided by the radius

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:19.020
So we can actually use this information to do other interesting things later on

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.860
But hopefully this gives you a sense of how all of this stuff is related
