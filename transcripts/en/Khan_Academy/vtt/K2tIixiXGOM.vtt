00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.010
In the last video I promised
you that I would show a

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.190
concrete example of
electrophilic aromatic

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.870
substitution.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.119
So let's do that right here.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.550
So let's say we have
some benzene.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.000
And it's a solution with
some molecular bromine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.770
So I'll draw the molecular
bromine like this.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.530
So it's one bromine
right there.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.310
It has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.350
seven, valence electrons.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.619
And it's bonded to another
bromine that has one, two,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.370
three, four, five, six,
seven electrons.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.170
These two guys in the middle
are bonded to each other.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.110
They can kind of act as an
electron pair or make bromines

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.840
feel like they have
eight electrons.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.540
This guy thinks he has
a magenta one.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.680
That guy thinks he
has the blue one.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.360
And let's say we have
some iron bromide

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.600
in our mix as well.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.760
And what we're going to see is
that this is going to catalyze

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.450
the reaction.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.290
So the iron bromide.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.300
We have some iron and
it's bonded to three

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.960
bromines just like that.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960
So we haven't seen iron
bromide much.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.250
But the way I think about it is,
bromine molecules are much

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.120
more electronegative
than the iron.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.360
So even though these look like
fair covalent bonds, if we had

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.830
thought about oxidation, these
guys are going to be hogging

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.490
the electrons.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.930
This actually would have an
oxidation number of three.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.820
And in reality they are
hogging the electrons.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.260
They are more electronegative.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.070
So the way I think about is
that this iron will have a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.590
slightly positive charge.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.320
Because the electrons are being
hogged away from it.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.430
So it wouldn't mind to
gain an electron.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.810
Or it might want to accept
an electron.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.150
It might want to act
as a Lewis acid.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.090
Remember a Lewis acid will
accept an electron.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.050
So this might want to
act as a Lewis acid.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.340
So who can it nab
electrons from?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
Well maybe it can nab an
electron from this bromine

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.970
right here.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.220
And I'm not saying that this
always going to occur, but

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.460
under the right circumstances
if they bump into each other

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.150
with the right energies
it can happen.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.509
So this electron-- let me do it
in a different color that I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.040
haven't used yet, this green
color-- let's say this

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.140
electron right here gets
nabbed by that iron.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.380
Then what do we have?

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.300
Well then we have a situation,
we have this bromine-- the

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.380
blue one-- with one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.760
valence electrons.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.420
We have the magenta bromine
with one, two,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.150
three, four, five.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.380
Now it only has the sixth
valence electron right here.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.760
The seventh got nabbed
by the iron.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.900
So the iron has the seventh
valence electron and then you

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.860
have the rest of the molecule.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.670
So then you have your iron and
it's attached, of course, to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.920
the three bromines.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.300
Just like that.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.670
And then our bonds, these
guys were bonded.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.700
They still are bonded.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.410
And now these guys are bonded.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.370
These were in a pair.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.330
This electron jumped
over to the iron.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.990
And now we have another bond.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.220
But because this bromine lost an
electron-- it was neutral,

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.715
it lost an electron-- it now
has a positive charge.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.200
And the iron, now that it gained
this electron, now has

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.450
a negative charge.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.490
So let's think about what's
going to happen now.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.140
Now we're going to bring the
benzene into the mix.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.380
So let me redraw the benzene.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.200
And we have this double bond,
that double bond, and then

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.860
just to make things clear, let
me draw this double bond with

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.400
the two electrons
on either end.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.410
So we have the orange electron,
you have your green

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.810
electron right over there, and
I'll draw the double bond as

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.810
being green.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.170
Now let's think about this
molecule right here.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.300
We have a bromine with
a positive charge.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.920
Bromines are really, really,
really, electronegative.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.590
You might see them with a
negative charge, but the

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.960
positive charge, it really wants
to grab an electron.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.680
And in the right circumstances,
you can imagine

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.060
where it really wants to grab
that electron right there.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.430
So maybe, if there was
just some way it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.820
could pull this electron.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.030
But the only way it could pull
this electron is maybe if

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.170
this-- because if it just took
that electron than this

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.930
bromine would have a positive
charge, which isn't cool.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.725
So this bromine maybe would
want to pull an electron.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.565
If this guy gets an electron,
then this

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:33.770
guy can get an electron.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.160
So you can imagine this thing
as a whole really, really

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.290
wants to grab an electron.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.640
It might be very good
at doing it.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.520
So this is our strong
electrophile.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.290
So what actually will happen
in the bromination of this

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.210
benzene ring-- let me draw some
hydrogens here just to

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.050
make things clear.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.520
We already have hydrogens
on all of these carbons.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.580
Sometimes it's important to
visualize this when we're

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.640
doing electrophilic aromatic
substitutions.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.400
So we already have a hydrogen
on all of these molecules.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.840
So maybe this is so
electrophilic it can actually

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.860
break the aromatic ring, nab
this electron right there.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.700
So maybe, this electron right
there goes to the bromine.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.460
Maybe I should even
do it this way.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.290
Just to make it clear.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.520
Kind of replaces that one.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.380
Although, obviously the
electrons are a bit fungible.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.720
So maybe it goes over there.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880
And then when it goes to this--
let me make it clear

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.180
it's going to the
blue bromine.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.860
So the electron right here
goes to the blue bromine.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.790
If the blue bromine gets an
electron then it can let go of

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.960
this blue electron.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.360
So this blue electron
can then go to this

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.680
bromine right over here.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.010
And then what is our situation
look like?

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.590
Well if we have that, then let
me draw our benzene ring

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.130
first. We have our benzene ring
first. So let me draw the

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.380
benzene ring.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.830
This double bond, that
double bond.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.830
Let me draw all of
the hydrogens.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.260
I want to do them in purple.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.930
So we have one hydrogen, two
hydrogens, three hydrogens,

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.480
four hydrogens, five hydrogens,
and six hydrogens.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.290
This orange electron is still
with this carbon right here.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.850
But that electron got nabbed
by this bromine.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:36.830
So that electron got nabbed by
this bromine right over here.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.140
I've kind of flipped it around
and now it has its other six

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.890
valence electrons.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.240
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.830
The electron got taken away
from this carbon.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.720
So now that carbon will have
a positive charge.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.330
But we saw in the last video,
it's actually resonance

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.980
stabilized.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.380
That electron could
jump there.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.420
That electron can jump there.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.970
So it's not as stable
as a nice aromatic

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.020
benzene ring like this.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.510
But it's not a ridiculous
carbocation.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.920
It's stable enough for it to
exist for some small amount of

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.000
time while we kind of hit
our transition state.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.510
And then this molecule
over here, what's it

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.420
going to look like?

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.810
Well this bromine had
a positive charge.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.050
Now it gained an electron.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.860
Let me draw it.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.360
So you have your bromine.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.670
It gained an electron.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.090
So now it is neutral again.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.960
So let's see, it had the one,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.700
Now it gained this
blue electron.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.680
So now it's seven valence
electrons.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.190
Back to being neutral.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.570
It's bonded to the
iron bromide.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.700
Let me draw the bromines.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.300
One, two, three.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.060
And so we've given this blue
bromine to the benzene ring.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.240
But it's not happy here.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.960
It doesn't want to break
it's aromaticity.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.830
It wants an electron back.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.860
So how can it gain
an electron back?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.140
Well this thing-- actually let
me make it very clear.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:09.950
Let me make it clear.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.265
This thing had a negative
charge.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.590
So you can imagine-- and we had
this electron right here.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.740
So maybe this thing right
over here can now act

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.310
as an actual base.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.590
It can nab a proton off
of the benzene ring.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.060
Just like we saw in
the last video.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.610
This is now the base.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.429
This whole complex, to some
degree, acted as a strong

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:33.470
electrophile.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.179
Now that we got rid of one of
bromines, this thing might

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.539
want to grab a proton now, since
it is positive and will

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:41.690
act as our base.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.600
And will nab one of
these protons.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.390
If it nabs the proton,
than the leftover

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.940
electron is still there.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.220
That electron is still there.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.470
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.950
I'll do it in red.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.270
That electron is still there.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.440
And then that electron can
be given to that original

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.400
carbocation and we'll have a
nice aromatic ring again.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.710
So how would that look?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.650
So you could imagine a situation
where this electron,

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:13.650
this green electron right
here, gets given to the

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.030
hydrogen nucleus.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.530
If it's given to that hydrogen
nucleus, then this red

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.810
electron right here can then
be given to the carbocation

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:24.110
And then what are
we left with?

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:33.060
Well, we have our-- let me draw
what we started with-- so

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.600
we have our ring.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.430
We have this double bond and
that double bond right there.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.080
Now let me draw all
of our hydrogens.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.180
We have this hydrogen, that
hydrogen, this one over here,

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.680
this one over here, and we
have this one over here.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.980
Now this hydrogen just
now got nabbed.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.070
So this hydrogen over here got
nabbed, it got given--

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.800
actually the hydrogen nucleus
got given this green electron.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.760
It got given this green
electron, which is paired with

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.550
this magenta one right
over here.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.400
So it is now bonded
to the bromine.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.870
We now have hydrogen bromide.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:16.220
And this had one, two, three,
four, five, six

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.390
other valence electrons.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.820
I'll keep the colors
consistent.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.970
And this is now bonded.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.470
Now this electron went
away from the iron.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.730
So the iron will now lose
its negative charge.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.950
The iron bromide.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.460
So now it is back in
its original form.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.250
So we have our iron bonded
to three bromines.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.150
We are bonded to three bromines
just like that.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.730
It has lost its negative
charge.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:50.150
And this electron right here
has now gone to the

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.100
carbocation So that electron
right there has now gone to

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.970
the carbocation.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.070
It is right there.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.950
So this bond, you can imagine it
now being this double bond.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.480
So it was magenta, so I'll draw
it in magenta just there.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.510
And we can't forget the whole
point of this whole video was

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.350
the bromination.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.030
So we now have this
bromo group there.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.440
So we have this orange electron
is right over here.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.540
And it is bonded to
that bromine.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:25.720
Just like that.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.210
And we have brominated the
benzene ring using-- and just

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.840
let's be clear-- we had
a negative charge

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.700
and a positive charge.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.660
Now it's canceled out.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.940
The thing with the negative
charge gave an electron to the

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.870
positive charge.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.140
It is now neutral.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.470
That is now neutral.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.740
Now let's be clear on
what happened here.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.810
Just to map it to what
we saw before.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.600
We had a benzene ring.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.670
Right here we have no
strong electrophile,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.880
or strong base yet.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.920
It had to become a strong
electrophile.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.950
When this thing gave an electron
to the iron bromine,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.300
it became this larger
molecule.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.090
Now this whole thing can
act as a pretty strong

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.190
electrophile.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.260
This grabbed an electron.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.910
It broke the aromaticity
of the benzene ring.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.730
But just long enough for
this bromine to form.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.980
But once this bromine, it gained
an electron and then

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.690
bonded to the benzene.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.340
And then gave up an electron
to this other bromine that

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.120
really wanted to get an electron
because it had a

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.190
positive charge.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.410
And then once it got it,
now this whole thing

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.730
acted as the base.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.050
So we kind of have the same
molecule changing up a little

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.570
bit, acting as an electrophile
or acting as a base.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.470
And then once it acts as a
base, this bromine, this

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:38.800
magenta bromine, nabs the
proton, allows this electron

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.780
to go back to that carbocation
and then we're left with the

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.090
iron bromide again.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.210
So this thing really
didn't change

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.390
through the whole reaction.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.940
That's why we can call it a
catalyst. It wasn't one of the

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.740
reagents, one of the reactants
in the reaction.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.760
Hopefully you found that
vaguely interesting.
