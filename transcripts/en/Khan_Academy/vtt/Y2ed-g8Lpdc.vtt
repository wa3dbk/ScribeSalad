00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.030
The number of all possible values of theta,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.890
where theta is between zero and pi

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.140
for which the system of equations

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.380
y plus z cosine of 3 theta is equal x y z sin 3 theta

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.590
x sin of 3 theta is equal to 2 cos 3 theta over y

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.420
plus 2 sin 3 theta over z

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.640
xyz sin 3 theta is equal y plus two z cos of 3 theta

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.500
plus y sin 3 theta, has a solution

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.960
x naught y naught z naught with y naught and z naught

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.920
not equal to zero is, which means either of these cannot equal zero

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.530
So this is a pretty daunting thing,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.680
I just like to simplify this as much as possible.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.410
I want to do two things. All of the trigonometric functions here

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.640
they're all - they're taking sin of,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.370
the cosine of three theta and have theta between zero and pi

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.300
I'll do a little substitution.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.690
this is just from my brain,cause it simplifies my logic a little bit

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.420
let's make a substitution

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.940
that u is equal to -

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.900
is equal to three theta

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.470
and then the u - when theta is zero, u is going to be -

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.710
so u is still going to be greater than zero

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.660
and when theta is pi, u is going to - have to be less than three pi

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.600
And so - let's find the number of Us between zero and three pi

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.830
where y plus z cosine of u is equal to xyz sine of u

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.950
so on and so forth. so that -

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.440
Let's do that substitution and I'm going to rearrange these

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.370
so that they start at least look a little familiar

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.170
and see if we can somehow start manipulating with the these equations

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.430
and actually try to cancel out terms

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.130
so this first one up here

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.180
just to get in a term ways i can recognize.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.200
let me distribute the cosine of three theta

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.460
or which will now call the cosine of u. So let me just writ this

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.680
This is u

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:57.130
this is u, this u now, this is u, u, u, u and u

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.100
so this - if we distribute the cosine of u,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.000
this becomes cosine of u - let me put the y out front.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.690
so it's y cosine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to xyz sine of u.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.110
that's this first equation

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.820
this second equation

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.430
this second equation it looks like -

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.320
well if we multiply both sides of this equation by yz

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.650
we're gonna have xyz sine of u on the right hand side

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.260
which is the exact same thing we have here.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.480
so let's multiply both sides of this equation by xyz, both sides.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.030
the right hand of the equation - no, not by xyz, just by yz

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.770
So we are gonna multiply both sides of this equation by yz.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.070
so that these leave the denominator

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.430
we are also gonna multiply the right side by yz

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.210
the left hand side becomes xyz sine of u

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.000
and let me write it over here just write it like this.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.060
So this is x yz sine of u

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.030
and then yz times two cosine of u is going to be

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.260
two z cosine of u

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.060
so two z the cosine of u, I just swap the sides

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.300
and then yz times two sine of u

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.510
is going to be two y sine of u

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.810
so two y - two y sine of u.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.910
So this is the second equation.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.820
now they don't look bad different

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.290
when they were written like this it look very different.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.060
I'll thinks about this one.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.260
this side has xyz sine of u

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.910
I'll do it in magenta

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.540
this equation xyz sine of u.I'll write it on this side

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.210
xyz sine of u is equal to -

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.440
is equal to let's see we have a two z

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.760
Let's distribute this cosine of u. we have a two z cosine of u

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.970
so plus two z cosine -

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
two z cosine of u plus y cosine of u

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.900
so we have a plus y cosine of u.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.000
that's that times that plus y sine of u

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.450
so let me scroll to the left a little bit. y sine of u

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.450
so I have rewritten these three equations.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.160
The problem looks a lot less daunting right now.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Let's try to figure out the number of Us between zero and three pi

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.590
that will satisfy - that will give us a solution here.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.120
so let's see all of these three equations are equal to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.720
this expression right over here. so the left-hand sides -

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.400
the left-hand sides of these equations all have to equal each other

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.690
because they're all equaled the exact same value

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.680
so let's do that. Let's see what we can do in the way of canceling

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.810
in the way of canceling things out.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.490
Let's see if we use this is a plus right here.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.490
I don't know I wrote an equal here

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.870
so let's see if we write this has got to be equal to that.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.870
So let me use these two first

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.000
so this thing

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:21.530
so we have two y sine of u plus two z cosine of u

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.720
is equal to this which is that, which has to be equal to this,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:32.860
is going to be equal to y sine of u plus y cosine of u

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.080
plus two z cosine - plus two z cosine of u

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.220
we have two z cosine of u on both sides,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.620
so that gets rid of the z terms

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.520
and then we have a two y sine of u and we have a y sine of u.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.740
So if we subtract y sine of u from both sides

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.990
we end up with a y sine of u

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.870
y sine of u to subtracting this from both sides,two y minus y sin of u

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:59.880
it's just gonna be y sine of u

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.820
is equal to y cosine of u.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.800
so in order for this, in order to have a solution here,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.380
in order for this to be a [inaudible] statement.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.440
remember y cannot be equal to zero in order for this

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.590
to end up having a solution

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.630
the coefficient on y have to equal each other.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.500
sine of u has to be equal to

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.670
sine of u has to be equal to cosine of u.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.860
so that's one constraint.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.020
sine of u has to be equal to cosine of u

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.760
And let's think about the unit circle

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.640
and think about how many times are the sine and the cosine

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.810
equal to each other when you're going between zero and three pi.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.930
So I got the unit circle right over here

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.360
now clearly when we're at forty five degrees

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.480
sine and cosine are equal to each other or forty five degrees

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.300
is the same thing as pi over four

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.220
there they're equal to each other

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.350
you might be tempted to do this over here

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.610
but here the cosine is negative sine is positive.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.570
so that won't work

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.480
they're both negative over here but they're equal.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.190
so that's another value

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.940
and then this won't work

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.710
So so far we've traveled to two pi.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.610
we can go another half, we can go three pi,

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.610
so we can go back to this one again

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.990
so we can go back to this value again.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.900
so there are one two and then when you go all the way around again

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.310
three values and then we can't go back to this one

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.200
because we can only go -

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.690
Let me just use another color.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.160
We can only go three pi for u. So we can only go -

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.460
that's two pi and then go another time around.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.290
that is three pi

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.120
so there's one two three values

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:52.720
so there's three three possible Us.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.610
Just from this constraint, just one we use this blue equation

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.270
and this magenta equation. Now let's just make sure -

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.530
Let's just make sure that there aren't any further

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.720
that there aren't any further constraints over here.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.290
so let's see if we can -

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.380
let's use two of the other equations

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.190
and the one that I would want to use

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.170
that seems like there might be some cancellation.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.480
Well we can just use -

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.180
We could use either this guy and this guy

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.680
y cosine of u plus two z

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.700
Yeah. Why not? So let's use -

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.730
So as long as we're using all three equation in our constraints.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.510
we will have kind of properly constrained

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.570
all of the possible solutions.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.030
and so let's think about this.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.880
This equals that, which is equal to that, which is equal to that.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:48.450
so we can write y cosine of u plus z cosine of u

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.660
is equal to this whole thing over here,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:09:04.510
is equal to y sine of u plus y cosine of u plus two z cosine of u

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.450
and then we have a y cosine of u on both sides.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.950
Those would cancel out.

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.340
we can subtract a z cosine of u from both sides.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.510
a z cosine of u from both sides

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:23.340
and so we would get zero is equal to y sine of u

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.510
plus z cosine - plus z cosine of u

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:32.800
and this seems like a pretty benign statement.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.880
y sine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to zero

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.480
let me make sure this.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.930
y sine of u plus z cosine of u is equal to zero that means that

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.920
this is means that two times this is also going to be zero.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:54.330
so this is equal to two y sine of u plus

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.090
two z cosine of u is equal to zero.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.520
The only reason is I multiply it by two

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.320
because by now this looks identical to this

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.370
so - when you're used this equation and this equation,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.810
I got a constraint that this expression right over here

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.520
this expression right over here essentially needs to be equal to zero

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.380
that this expression over here essentially needs to be equal to zero

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.500
which is ok

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.750
which is ok because u could make the sine equal zero

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.690
or x can be equal to zero.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.930
remember, they didn't put any constrains on x

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.910
x can be equal to zero so this is really constraining us.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.970
x can clearly be equal to zero

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.080
which could make this thing equal to zero.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.080
so it's not limiting our constraints.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.110
so now we've used all of the information that's in the problem.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.570
we've used all three of these surfaces

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.820
essentially to find out if there's an inter -

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:52.250
what the constraints we have for intersection of the three surfaces

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.830
and the only real constraint is that

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.430
the sine of u has to be equal to the cosine of u

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.210
and there're three possible Us

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.730
between zero and three pi that satisfied that.
