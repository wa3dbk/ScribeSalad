00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.990
We're told to factor r squared
plus 4r, minus 45.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.740
And there are simpler ways to
factor this, because this has

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.160
1 as a leading coefficient on
the r squared right here, but

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.990
what we're going to do
is we're going to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.420
factor this by grouping.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.750
And when you factor it by
grouping, what you want to do

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.110
is find two numbers whose
product-- so the two numbers

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.920
are a and b-- whose product is
equal to the coefficient on r

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.910
squared, 1 times negative 45,
which is just negative 45.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.900
And whose sum is equal to the
coefficient on the first

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.450
degree term, is equal to 4.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.130
a plus b is equal to 4.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.950
So let's look at all of the
different combinations that

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.180
goes to negative 45, and see
if when you add them,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.090
you ever get to 4.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.395
So let's take the
combinations.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.910
Let's look at their different
a's and b's, and let's see

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.120
what happens when
you sum them.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.200
So I could try 1 and negative
45, but if you take their sum,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.260
that's not going to get you
anywhere close to 4, even if

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.110
you swapped them, negative
1 and positive 45.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.030
Let's see, if you do 3 and 15, 3
and negative 15, or negative

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.150
3 and 15, those are way
more than 4 apart.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.890
We're going to have
to find numbers

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.930
that are closer together.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.660
So let's see, 3, 4, 5 and 9,
that looks interesting.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.120
5 and 9 are 4 apart.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.040
And if we go with 5 and negative
9, what's their sum?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.930
Their sum is negative 4.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.120
What happens if we go with
negative 5 and positive 9?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
Well, then their sum
is 4, so negative 5

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.560
and positive 9 works.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.460
So what we want to do here, now
that we found the numbers

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.350
whose product is equal to the 1
times negative 45, and whose

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.550
sum is equal to 4, let's break
this 4r up into a sum of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.510
negative 5-- let me break
it up this way--

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.390
into 9r minus 5r.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.040
I broke that 4r into that using
our two numbers, and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.430
then I could put the r squared
out front, r squared, and then

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.810
we have a minus 45.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.370
And now we're ready
to group this and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.770
then factor by grouping.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.840
So let's look at this first
group right here.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.090
They both have the common
factor of r, so let's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.160
factor out an r.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.900
This is equal to r times-- r
square divided by r is r.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.890
9r divided by r is 9.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.700
So that's that first group.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.510
And the second group right here,
has a common factor of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.510
negative 5.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.760
So let's factor it out.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.210
Negative 5r divided by negative
5 is just an r.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.240
Negative 45 divided by
negative 5 is a 9.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.820
And then we have an r plus 9 in
both terms. r times r plus

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.060
9, negative 5 times r plus 9.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.710
So we can factor that out.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:58.290
So you factor an r plus 9 out,
and you're left with r times r

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.040
plus 9, divided by r plus 9
is just going to be an r.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.350
And then negative 5 times r plus
9, divided by r plus 9 is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.200
negative 5, and we're done!
