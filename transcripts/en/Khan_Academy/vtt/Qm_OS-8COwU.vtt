00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.720
One term you are going to hear
a lot of in these videos, and

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.080
in linear algebra in general,
is the idea of a linear

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.330
combination.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.020
And all a linear combination of
vectors are, they're just a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.809
linear combination.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.910
Let me show you what
that means.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.160
So let's say I have a couple
of vectors, v1, v2, and it

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.970
goes all the way to vn.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.580
And they're all in, you know,
it can be in R2 or Rn.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.510
Let's say that they're
all in Rn.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.600
They're in some dimension of
real space, I guess you could

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.800
call it, but the idea
is fairly simple.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.910
A linear combination of these
vectors means you just add up

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.640
the vectors.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.420
It's some combination of a sum
of the vectors, so v1 plus v2

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.990
plus all the way to vn,
but you scale them

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.110
by arbitrary constants.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.560
So you scale them by c1, c2,
all the way to cn, where

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.720
everything from c1
to cn are all a

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.970
member of the real numbers.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.870
That's all a linear
combination is.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.070
Let me show you a concrete
example of linear

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.810
combinations.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.960
Let me make the vector.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.320
Let me define the vector a to
be equal to-- and these are

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.180
all bolded.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.140
These purple, these are all
bolded, just because those are

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.490
vectors, but sometimes it's
kind of onerous to keep

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.160
bolding things.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.890
So let's just say I define the
vector a to be equal to 1, 2.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.820
And I define the vector
b to be equal to 0, 3.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.780
What is the linear combination
of a and b?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.490
Well, it could be any constant
times a plus any

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.550
constant times b.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.870
So it could be 0 times a plus--
well, it could be 0

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.690
times a plus 0 times b, which,
of course, would be what?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.650
That would be 0 times 0,
that would be 0, 0.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.810
That would be the 0 vector, but
this is a completely valid

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.860
linear combination.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.980
And we can denote the
0 vector by just a

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.945
big bold 0 like that.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.580
I could do 3 times a.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880
I'm just picking these
numbers at random.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.960
3 times a plus-- let me do a
negative number just for fun.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.590
So I'm going to do plus
minus 2 times b.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.820
What is that equal to?

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.230
Let's figure it out.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.190
Let me write it out.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.140
It's 3 minus 2 times 0,
so minus 0, and it's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.490
3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.270
6 minus 2 times 3, so minus 6,
so it's the vector 3, 0.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.590
This is a linear combination
of a and b.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.170
I can keep putting in a bunch
of random real numbers here

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.070
and here, and I'll just get a
bunch of different linear

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.740
combinations of my
vectors a and b.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.720
If I had a third vector here,
if I had vector c, and maybe

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.200
that was just, you know, 7, 2,
then I could add that to the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.640
mix and I could throw in
plus 8 times vector c.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.150
These are all just linear
combinations.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.680
Now why do we just call
them combinations?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.960
Why do you have to add that
little linear prefix there?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.130
Because we're just
scaling them up.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.360
We're not multiplying the
vectors times each other.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.280
We haven't even defined what it
means to multiply a vector,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.010
and there's actually several
ways to do it.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.350
But, you know, we can't square
a vector, and we haven't even

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.260
defined what this means yet, but
this would all of a sudden

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.270
make it nonlinear
in some form.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.400
So all we're doing is we're
adding the vectors, and we're

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.610
just scaling them up by some
scaling factor, so that's why

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.780
it's called a linear
combination.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.920
Now you might say, hey Sal, why
are you even introducing

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.880
this idea of a linear
combination?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.610
Because I want to introduce the
idea, and this is an idea

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.270
that confounds most students
when it's first taught.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.730
I think it's just the very
nature that it's taught.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.080
Over here, I just kept putting
different numbers for the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.110
weights, I guess we could call
them, for c1 and c2 in this

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.350
combination of a and b, right?

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.860
Let's ignore c for
a little bit.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.320
I just put in a bunch of
different numbers there.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.470
But it begs the question: what
is the set of all of the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.280
vectors I could have created?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.530
And this is just one
member of that set.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.390
But what is the set of all of
the vectors I could've created

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.500
by taking linear combinations
of a and b?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.990
So let me draw a and b here.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.280
Maybe we can think about it
visually, and then maybe we

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.190
can think about it
mathematically.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.850
So let's say a and b.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.160
So a is 1, 2.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.650
So 1, 2 looks like that.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.060
That's vector a.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.760
Let me do vector b in
a different color.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.720
We're going to do
it in yellow.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.330
Vector b is 0, 3.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.400
So vector b looks
like that: 0, 3.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.320
So what's the set of all of
the vectors that I can

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.120
represent by adding and
subtracting these vectors?

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
And we said, if we multiply them
both by zero and add them

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.450
to each other, we
end up there.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.820
If we take 3 times a, that's
the equivalent of

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.030
scaling up a by 3.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.880
So you go 1a, 2a, 3a.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.410
So that's 3a, 3 times a
will look like that.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.750
So this vector is 3a, and then
we added to that 2b, right?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.400
Oh no, we subtracted 2b
from that, so minus

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.680
b looks like this.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.120
Minus 2b looks like this.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.710
This is minus 2b, all the way,
in standard form, standard

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.930
position, minus 2b.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.410
So if you add 3a to minus 2b,
we get to this vector.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.860
3a to minus 2b, you get this
vector right here, and that's

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.060
exactly what we did when we
solved it mathematically.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.430
You get the vector 3, 0.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.500
You get this vector
right here, 3, 0.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.060
But this is just one
combination, one linear

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.620
combination of a and b.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.560
Instead of multiplying a times
3, I could have multiplied a

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.970
times 1 and 1/2 and just
gotten right here.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:24.840
So 1 and 1/2 a minus 2b would
still look the same.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.830
It would look like something
like this.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.550
It would look something like--
let me make sure I'm doing

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.060
this-- it would look something
like this.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.160
And so our new vector that
we would find would be

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.910
something like this.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.060
So I just showed you, I can find
this vector with a linear

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.420
combination.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.430
I can find this vector with
a linear combination.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.190
And actually, it turns out that
you can represent any

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:52.530
vector in R2 with some linear
combination of these vectors

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.270
right here, a and b.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:00.020
Now, let's just think of an
example, or maybe just try a

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.400
mental visual example.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.350
Wherever we want to go, we
could go arbitrarily-- we

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:12.840
could scale a up by some
arbitrary value.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.650
So this is some weight on a,
and then we can add up

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.060
arbitrary multiples of b.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.510
B goes straight up and down,
so we can add up arbitrary

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.060
multiples of b to that.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.740
So we could get any point on
this line right there.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.070
Now, if we scaled a up a little
bit more, and then

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.400
added any multiple b, we'd get
anything on that line.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.100
If we multiplied a times a
negative number and then added

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.260
a b in either direction, we'll
get anything on that line.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.110
We can keep doing that.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.360
And there's no reason why we
can't pick an arbitrary a that

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.800
can fill in any of these gaps.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.765
If we want a point here, we just
take a little smaller a,

00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:49.540
and then we can add all
the b's that fill

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.390
up all of that line.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.060
So we can fill up any
point in R2 with the

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.700
combinations of a and b.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.990
So what we can write here is
that the span-- let me write

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.230
this word down.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:10.600
The span of the vectors a and
b-- so let me write that

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:18.140
down-- it equals R2 or it equals
all the vectors in R2,

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.120
which is, you know, it's
all the tuples.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.300
R2 is all the tuples
made of two ordered

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.550
tuples of two real numbers.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:25.780
So it equals all of R2.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.450
This just means that I can
represent any vector in R2

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:32.220
with some linear combination
of a and b.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.710
And you're like, hey, can't I do
that with any two vectors?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:40.799
Well, what if a and b were the
vector-- let's say the vector

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:48.490
2, 2 was a, so a is equal to 2,
2, and let's say that b is

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:54.590
the vector minus 2, minus
2, so b is that vector.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.320
So b is the vector
minus 2, minus 2.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.420
Now, can I represent any
vector with these?

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.200
Well, I can scale a up and down,
so I can scale a up and

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.670
down to get anywhere on this
line, and then I can add b

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.940
anywhere to it, and
b is essentially

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.120
going in the same direction.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.590
It's just in the opposite
direction, but I can multiply

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.750
it by a negative and go
anywhere on the line.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.590
So any combination of a and b
will just end up on this line

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.320
right here, if I draw
it in standard form.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.790
It'll be a vector with the same
slope as either a or b,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.300
or same inclination, whatever
you want to call it.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.050
I could never-- there's no
combination of a and b that I

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.330
could represent this vector,
that I could

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.550
represent vector c.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:35.440
I just can't do it.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.150
I can add in standard form.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.020
I could just keep adding scale
up a, scale up b, put them

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.520
heads to tails, I'll just get
the stuff on this line.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.230
I'll never get to this.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.530
So in this case, the span--
and I want to be clear.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.640
This is for this particular a
and b, not for the a and b--

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.590
for this blue a and this yellow
b, the span here is

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.820
just this line.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.820
It's just this line.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.830
It's not all of R2.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.980
So this isn't just some kind of
statement when I first did

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.720
it with that example.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.040
It's like, OK, can
any two vectors

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.000
represent anything in R2?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:13.730
Well, no.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.220
I just showed you two vectors
that can't represent that.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.550
What is the span of
the 0 vector?

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.900
I'll put a cap over it, the 0
vector, make it really bold.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.790
Well, the 0 vector is just 0,
0, so I don't care what

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:33.760
multiple I put on it.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.490
The span of it is all of the
linear combinations of this,

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.650
so essentially, I could put
arbitrary real numbers here,

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.430
but I'm just going to end
up with a 0, 0 vector.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.700
So the span of the 0 vector
is just the 0 vector.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.830
The only vector I can get with
a linear combination of this,

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.830
the 0 vector by itself, is
just the 0 vector itself.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.720
Likewise, if I take the span of
just, you know, let's say I

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.620
go back to this example
right here.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.540
My a vector was right
like that.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.400
Let me draw it in
a better color.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.010
My a vector looked like that.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:13.350
If I were to ask just what the
span of a is, it's all the

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.280
vectors you can get by
creating a linear

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.690
combination of just a.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:18.220
So it's really just scaling.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.450
You can't even talk about
combinations, really.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.370
So it's just c times a,
all of those vectors.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:30.230
And we saw in the video where
I parametrized or showed a

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.430
parametric representation of a
line, that this, the span of

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.750
just this vector a, is the line
that's formed when you

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.050
just scale a up and down.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.340
So span of a is just a line.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.620
You have to have two vectors,
and they can't be collinear,

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.500
in order span all of R2.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.620
And I haven't proven that to you
yet, but we saw with this

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.780
example, if you pick this a and
this b, you can represent

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.080
all of R2 with just
these two vectors.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.640
Now, the two vectors that you're
most familiar with to

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.550
that span R2 are, if you take
a little physics class, you

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.320
have your i and j
unit vectors.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.990
And in our notation, i, the unit
vector i that you learned

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.560
in physics class, would
be the vector 1, 0.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.710
So this is i, that's the vector
i, and then the vector

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:25.320
j is the unit vector 0, 1.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.110
This is what you learned
in physics class.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.310
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.560
This is j.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.420
j is that.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.270
And you learned that they're
orthogonal, and we're going to

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.840
talk a lot more about what
orthogonality means, but in

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.690
our traditional sense that we
learned in high school, it

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.840
means that they're 90 degrees.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.060
But you can clearly represent
any angle, or any vector, in

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.660
R2, by these two vectors.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.610
And the fact that they're
orthogonal makes them extra

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.816
nice, and that's why these
form-- and I'm going to throw

00:12:51.816 --> 00:12:53.500
out a word here that I
haven't defined yet.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.970
These form the basis.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.290
These form a basis for R2.

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.070
In fact, you can represent
anything in R2 by these two

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:00.600
vectors. line.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.130
I'm not going to even define
what basis is.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.670
That's going to be
a future video.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.940
But let me just write the formal
math-y definition of

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.000
span, just so you're
satisfied.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.430
So if I were to write the span
of a set of vectors, v1, v2,

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:24.020
all the way to vn, that just
means the set of all of the

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:31.340
vectors, where I have c1 times
v1 plus c2 times v2 all the

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.780
way to cn-- let me scroll over--
all the way to cn vn.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.670
So this is a set of vectors
because I can pick my ci's to

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.640
be any member of the real
numbers, and that's true for

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.830
i-- so I should write for i to
be anywhere between 1 and n.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.310
All I'm saying is that look, I
can multiply each of these

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.350
vectors by any value, any
arbitrary value, real value,

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.430
and then I can add them up.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.340
And now the set of all of the
combinations, scaled-up

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:12.280
combinations I can get, that's
the span of these vectors.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.850
You can kind of view it as the
space of all of the vectors

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:21.140
that can be represented by a
combination of these vectors

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.040
right there.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.930
And so the word span,
I think it does have

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.800
an intuitive sense.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.720
I mean, if I say that, you know,
in my first example, I

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.770
showed you those two vectors
span, or a and b spans R2.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.720
I wrote it right here.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.900
That tells me that any vector in
R2 can be represented by a

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.930
linear combination of a and b.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.980
And actually, just in case
that visual kind of

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.960
pseudo-proof doesn't do you
justice, let me prove it to

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.300
you algebraically.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.910
I'm telling you that I can
take-- let's say I want to

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.670
represent, you know, I have
some-- let me rewrite my a's

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.740
and b's again.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.060
So this was my vector a.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.260
It was 1, 2, and b was 0, 3.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.250
Let me remember that.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:17.540
So my vector a is 1, 2, and
my vector b was 0, 3.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.410
Now my claim was that I can
represent any point.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:25.270
Let's say I want to represent
some arbitrary point x in R2,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.640
so its coordinates
are x1 and x2.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.210
I need to be able to prove to
you that I can get to any x1

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.760
and any x2 with some combination
of these guys.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:41.240
So let's say that my
combination, I say c1 times a

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.460
plus c2 times b has to be
equal to my vector x.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.530
Let me show you that I can
always find a c1 or c2 given

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.405
that you give me some x's.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.870
So let's just write this right
here with the actual vectors

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:04.010
being represented in their
kind of column form.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:11.420
So we have c1 times this vector
plus c2 times the b

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:18.020
vector 0, 3 should be able to
be equal to my x vector,

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.630
should be able to be equal to my
x1 and x2, where these are

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.940
just arbitrary.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.600
So let's see if I can
set that to be true.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.720
So if this is true, then the
following must be true. c1

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:36.410
times 1 plus 0 times c2
must be equal to x1.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.250
We just get that from our
definition of multiplying

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.820
vectors times scalars
and adding vectors.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:48.550
And then we also know that
2 times c2-- sorry.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:58.090
c1 times 2 plus c2 times 3, 3c2,
should be equal to x2.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.760
Now, if I can show you that I
can always find c1's and c2's

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.130
given any x1's and x2's, then
I've proven that I can get to

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.450
any point in R2 using just
these two vectors.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.839
So let me see if
I can do that.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:17.440
So this is just a system
of two unknowns.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.349
This is just 0.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.599
We can ignore it.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:23.780
So let's multiply this equation
up here by minus 2

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.550
and put it here.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.670
So we get minus 2, c1--
I'm just multiplying

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:30.040
this times minus 2.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.070
We get a 0 here, plus 0
is equal to minus 2x1.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.590
And then you add these two.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.500
You get 3c2, right?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.400
These cancel out.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.950
You get 3-- let me write it
in a different color.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:51.860
You get 3c2 is equal
to x2 minus 2x1.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.420
Or divide both sides by 3,
you get c2 is equal to

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:00.180
1/3 x2 minus x1.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.780
Now we'd have to go substitute
back in for c1.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.890
But we have this first equation
right here, that c1,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:11.670
this first equation that says
c1 plus 0 is equal to x1, so

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.530
c1 is equal to x1.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.380
So that one just
gets us there.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.260
So c1 is equal to x1.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.750
So you give me any point in R2--
these are just two real

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.730
numbers-- and I can just perform
this operation, and

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.100
I'll tell you what weights to
apply to a and b to get to

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.890
that point.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.190
If you say, OK, what combination
of a and b can get

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.520
me to the point-- let's say I
want to get to the point-- let

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.930
me go back up here.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.430
Oh, it's way up there.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.130
Let's say I'm looking to
get to the point 2, 2.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.860
So x1 is 2.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.400
Let me write it down here.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.510
Say I'm trying to get to the
point the vector 2, 2.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.830
What combinations of a
and b can be there?

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.930
Well, I know that c1 is equal
to x1, so that's equal to 2,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:07.760
and c2 is equal to 1/3
times 2 minus 2.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:13.000
So 2 minus 2 is 0, so
c2 is equal to 0.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.230
So if I want to just get to
the point 2, 2, I just

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.120
multiply-- oh, I
just realized.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.350
This was looking suspicious.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.430
I made a slight error here,
and this was good that I

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.550
actually tried it out
with real numbers.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:29.740
Over here, when I had 3c2 is
equal to x2 minus 2x1, I got

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.920
rid of this 2 over here.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:31.970
There's a 2 over here.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.150
I divide both sides by 3.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.200
I get 1/3 times x2 minus 2x1.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.260
And that's why I was like, wait,
this is looking strange.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.540
So I had to take a
moment of pause.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.720
So let's go to my corrected
definition of c2.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.630
C2 is equal to 1/3 times x2.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:55.830
So 2 minus 2 times x1,
so minus 2 times 2.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:01.880
So it's equal to 1/3 times 2
minus 4, which is equal to

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.670
minus 2, so it's equal
to minus 2/3.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:14.410
So if I multiply 2 times my
vector a minus 2/3 times my

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.600
vector b, I will get
to the vector 2, 2.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.480
And you can verify
it for yourself.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:29.470
2 times my vector a 1, 2, minus
2/3 times my vector b 0,

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.000
3, should equal 2, 2.
