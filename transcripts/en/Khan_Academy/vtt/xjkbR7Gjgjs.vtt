00:00:00.102 --> 00:00:02.438
We're asked to simply, or expand

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:05.875
(7x + 10) ^ 2

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:07.872
Now the first thing I will show you

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.008
is exactly what you should NOT do,

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:11.819
well there's this huge temptation.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.444
A lot of people will look at this and say

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:17.438
oh, that's (7x)^2 + 10^2.

00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:19.900
This is WRONG.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.082
And I'll write it in caps.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:24.311
This is WRONG!

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:25.844
What your brain is doing is thinking

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:29.838
if I had 7x times 10 and I squared that,

00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:35.689
this would be (7x)^2 times 10^2.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:38.893
We aren't multiplying here, we're adding 7x to 10.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:41.726
So you can't just square each of these terms.

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:43.398
I just wanted to highlight,

00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:46.788
this is completely wrong,

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:49.250
and to see why it's wrong,

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.689
you have to remind yourself

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:54.637
that (7x + 10)^2 is the exact same thing

00:00:54.637 --> 00:01:00.767
as (7x + 10)(7x + 10).

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:02.624
That's what it means to square something.

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:08.058
You're multiplying it by itself twice here.

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:09.451
So this is what it is,

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:14.095
so we're really just multiplying

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:16.278
a binomial, or two binomials,

00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:17.857
they just happen to be the same one,

00:01:17.857 --> 00:01:19.203
and you could use F.O.I.L.,

00:01:19.203 --> 00:01:20.782
you could use the distributive method,

00:01:20.782 --> 00:01:22.268
but this is actually a special case:

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:23.754
when you're squaring a binomial,

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:25.055
so let's just think about it

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:26.541
as a special case first then we can

00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:28.677
apply whatever we learn to this.

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.256
So we could've just done it straight here,

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:31.881
but I want to learn the general case

00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.367
so you can apply it to any problem

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:34.854
that you might see.

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:38.104
If I have (a+b) squared

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:40.751
We already realised that it's not a squared plus b squared

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:45.535
That is a plus b times a plus b.

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.785
and now we can use the distributive property

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:51.618
We can distribute this a + b times this a

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:56.495
So we get, we get a times a plus b

00:01:56.495 --> 00:01:59.188
and we can distribute the a plus b times this b

00:01:59.188 --> 00:02:04.296
plus b times a plus b, and we distribute this a

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:09.683
we get a squared plus ab plus b times a is another ab

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.516
And I'm just swapping the order so it's the same as this.

00:02:12.516 --> 00:02:15.488
plus b times b which is b squared.

00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:18.553
These are the same or these are like terms.

00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:21.015
So we can add them. One of something plus another of

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:24.033
that something will give you two of that something. 2 ab.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:27.609
We have a squared plus 2 ab plus b squared.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.346
So the pattern here, the pattern here, if I have a plus b squared

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:37.176
it's equal to a squared plus 2 times the product of these numbers

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:42.238
plus b squared. So over here I have seven x plus ten squared

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:45.674
So this is going to be equal to seven x squared

00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:50.690
seven x squared plus 2 times the product of seven x and 10.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.752
2 times seven x times 10 plus 10 squared.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:59.374
So, the difference between the right answer and the wrong answer

00:02:59.374 --> 00:03:02.718
is that you have this middle term here that you might have

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.854
forgotten about if you did it this way.

00:03:04.854 --> 00:03:07.780
And this comes out when you are multiplying all the different

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.219
combinations of the terms here.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.563
if we simplify this, if we simplify seven x squared

00:03:12.563 --> 00:03:15.024
That's seven squared times x squared.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:18.136
So seven squared is 49 times x squared

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:22.733
When you multiply this part out 2 times 7 times 10

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:28.353
which is 140 and then we have our x.

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:32.346
No other x there. And then plus 10 squared.

00:03:32.346 --> 99:59:59.999
So plus 100. And we are done.
