00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:02.903
I'm in the mood to improve my flexibility

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.433
a little bit so I decide to take some Yoga classes

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:10.172
so I show up at the local yoga place called Super Yoga

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:12.701
and ask them, "how much does it cost?"

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:15.737
And they say, "we've got a basic plan"

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:17.675
"and we've got a trial plan."

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:19.368
The trial plan, if you just want to try things out,

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:21.231
you can come to any of the sessions

00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.822
and it's going to cost you $12 per 1hr session.

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:27.035
but if you like what you're doing here

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.075
you might want to get a monthly membership

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.362
That'll be $20/month,

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.452
that you can view that as the basic plan

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:35.420
It's $20/month and then you get a discount per session

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.569
It'll only be $8 per session

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.590
So this seems interesting, but I'm a little bit confused.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.084
Which plan should I take?

00:00:44.084 --> 00:00:47.570
So the first place, I might start is to think about

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.956
how much I would pay

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:52.390
depending on how many sessions I actually take

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.101
And to do a little short hand here

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.282
let's just define some variables

00:00:56.282 --> 00:01:01.763
Let's say that S = "Number of Sessions" I attend per month

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:07.741
Number of sessions per month that I attend

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.941
I decided to attend at Super Yoga

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:15.155
And let's say that C = "Total Monthly Cost"

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:18.549
My Total Monthly Cost

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.941
So with these variables defined this way,

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.849
let's think about how much I would pay

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.141
under each of these plans

00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:26.527
depending on how many sessions I would attend

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:29.605
So first, let's think about the, we'll start with the Trial Plan

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:31.147
cause that seems a little simplier

00:01:31.147 --> 00:01:32.755
and I'll draw a little column here

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:38.768
I have a cost, actually, let me see, I'll draw my number of sessions

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:44.243
Number of sessions and then I have my cost

00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:47.135
and then I'm going to draw a little table here

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.048
A little table, that'll be for my trial plan

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:51.570
and then let's also do the same thing,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.093
since we're doing it for the trial plan

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:55.507
let's do it for the basic plan so that we can compare

00:01:55.845 --> 00:01:57.884
Let's do it for the basic plan

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.923
so I have the Number of sessions I attend

00:01:59.923 --> 00:02:03.768
and my Total Cost

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:08.887
So let's first think about, if I decide to attend no sessions

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:12.744
So if I decided to attend no sessions

00:02:12.744 --> 00:02:15.567
under my trial plan, what will be my cost?

00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:20.833
Well, $12 per session, 12 x no sessions

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:22.369
Well, I'm not going to have to pay anything

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.898
My cost is going to be zero

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:28.036
Now what about that same question

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:29.091
under the basic plan

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:33.102
If I have the basic plan, but in a given month

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:35.485
I attend no sessions,

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:38.036
I don't go to the gym, I don't go to this yoga gym at all

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.100
How much am I going to have to pay?

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:42.615
Well, it's $8 per sessions

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:44.230
I didn't have to go to any sessions

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.562
So I'm not going to have to pay anything

00:02:45.562 --> 00:02:46.894
on a per session basis

00:02:46.894 --> 00:02:49.418
but I will have to pay that $20/month

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:53.239
So I will have to pay $20

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.076
even though I didn't even attend

00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:57.923
That doesn't seem so good in that scenario

00:02:57.923 --> 00:03:00.365
But let's keep working through other scenarios

00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:04.286
Let's think about the scenario where I attend 1 session

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:07.249
Where I attend 1 session

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:11.011
Under the trial plan, how much will I have to pay?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.741
Well, it's $12/session x 1 session

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:21.561
I'm going to pay $12

00:03:21.637 --> 00:03:24.476
Let's think about that same scenario under the basic plan

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.011
Under the basic plan, if I attend 1 session

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:32.070
Well, it's $8/session x 1 session

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.173
$8 for that

00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:35.257
Plus just the basic monthly

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.967
So I'm just going to have to pay $20 + ($8 x 1)

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.209
So $28.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.981
I'm going to have to pay $28

00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:46.703
So still that trial plan still looks pretty good

00:03:46.703 --> 00:03:49.392
even if I attend 1 session

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:50.303
Let me make it clear

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:51.303
That's in dollars

00:03:51.303 --> 00:03:53.506
and that over here is $28

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:54.560
and I could keep going

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.615
and I encourage you to keep going

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:56.902
but let's try 1 more

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.433
just to see how, just to get a feel for the numbers here

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.989
If I attend 2 sessions under the trial plan

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.589
How much am I going to pay?

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:08.368
Well, it's $12/session x 2 sessions

00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:13.595
i'm going to pay $24

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:16.289
Let's think about the basic plan

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.969
if I attend 2 sessions

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.800
-- let me do that in a yellow colour --

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.911
if I attend 2 sessions

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:27.205
2 x $8/session, that's going to $16

00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:30.152
plus the $20 I'm going to have to spend every month

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:35.415
So it's going to 2 x $8

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:38.679
+ $20

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:41.389
= $16 + $20

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.100
= $36

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.507
So at least for the scenarios that we set up here

00:04:46.507 --> 00:04:49.151
if I attend 0 or 1 or 2 sessions

00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:51.552
the trial plan seems to be winning out

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:52.777
but I want to explore at what point

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.161
does the trial plan actually become a little bit worse

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:57.278
But before we do that

00:04:57.278 --> 00:04:59.893
let's think about if we can represent this

00:04:59.893 --> 00:05:00.970
this a little algebraically

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.173
because it's going to allow us to be a little bit more precise

00:05:03.173 --> 00:05:06.036
with coming up with our answers

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:09.168
So if we say that, S is the "Number of Sessions per Month"

00:05:09.168 --> 00:05:11.257
and C is the "Monthly Cost"

00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:15.303
How can we express the trial plan as an equation?

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.092
Well, we could say our Total Cost

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:20.911
our Total Monthly Cost

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.694
so this is for our trial plan right over here

00:05:22.694 --> 00:05:24.278
let me draw a dotted line over here to show

00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:25.968
well, the dotted line goes around there

00:05:25.968 --> 00:05:29.814
so under the trial plan our total cost is going to be equal to

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:37.559
well, it's $12/session x # of sessions

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:41.864
times S

00:05:41.864 --> 00:05:46.159
So under the trial plan I could say my total cost is equal to

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.902
$12 x # of Sessions

00:05:48.902 --> 00:05:52.101
$12/session x the Number of Sessions

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.948
Let's so the same thing with the basic plan

00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:56.748
How can we express that as an equation?

00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.752
Well, we have our total cost

00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:03.166
our total cost is going to be equal to

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:05.507
well, regardless of what we do

00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:07.676
any given month, we're going to have to pay

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:09.633
the $20/month

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.368
we're going to have to pay that 20

00:06:11.368 --> 00:06:12.270
So no matter what we do,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.172
we're going to have to pay that 20

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:14.488
just from the get-go

00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:17.923
and then we're going to pay $8/session

00:06:17.923 --> 00:06:34.005
so it's going to be $20 + ($8 x # of Sessions)

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:35.793
so that's interesting and you can see

00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:38.430
if you put S is 0 here,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.580
if you make S = 0

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:42.300
you get 20 + (8 x 0) which is 20

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.547
if you say S is 1, you get 20 + (8 x 1)

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:47.492
which is 28

00:06:47.492 --> 00:06:49.967
so you see that each of these S's and C's

00:06:49.967 --> 00:06:52.369
they satisfy this equation

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:53.786
Same thing over here

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:55.204
and we can keep trying more and more

00:06:55.204 --> 00:06:56.832
What's neat about these equations is

00:06:56.832 --> 00:06:59.100
just this equation encapsulates

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.369
all of the possible combinations here

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.594
and just this equation encapsulates

00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:08.623
all the possible combinations there

00:07:08.623 --> 00:07:10.189
and so for the next few videos,

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:11.483
what I want to do is explore

00:07:11.483 --> 00:07:13.444
How can we use these equations

00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:15.405
to come up with more insights as to

00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:18.533
which plan is better for me
