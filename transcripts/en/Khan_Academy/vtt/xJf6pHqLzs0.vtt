00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.660
I've now supplied you with two
definitions of the state

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.600
variable entropy.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.390
And it's S for entropy.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.110
The thermodynamic definition
said that the change in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.440
entropy is equal to the heat
added to the system divided by

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.560
the temperature at which
the heat is added.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.590
So obviously, if the temperature
is changing while

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.600
we add the heat, which is
normally the case, we're going

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
to have to do a little
bit of calculus.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.790
And then you can view this as
the mathematical, or the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.700
statistical, or the
combinatorical

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.710
definition of entropy.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.630
And this essentially says that
entropy is equal to some

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.320
constant times the natural log
of the number of states the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.840
system can take on.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.990
And this is the case when all
the states are equally

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.720
probable, which is a pretty
good assumption.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.180
If you have just a gazillion
molecules that could have a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.270
gazillion gazillion states,
you can assume they're all

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.760
roughly equally likely.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970
There's a slightly more involved
definition if they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.480
had different probabilities,
but we won't

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.750
worry about that now.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.570
So given that we've seen these
two definitions, it's a good

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.560
time to introduce you to the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.220
And that's this.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.959
And it's a pretty simple law,
but it explains a whole range

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:06.110
of phenomena.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:16.410
It tells us that the change in
entropy for the universe when

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.760
any process is undergone
is always greater

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.940
than or equal to 0.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.530
So that tells us that when
anything ever happens in the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.560
universe, the net effect is that
there's more entropy in

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.830
the universe itself.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.830
And this seems very deep,
and it actually is.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.440
So let's see if we can apply it
to see why it explains, or

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.400
why it makes sense, relative
to some examples.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
So let's say I have two
reservoirs that are in contact

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.610
with each other.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.110
So I have T1.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.140
And let's call this
our hot reservoir.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.390
And then I have T2.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.290
I'll call this our
cold reservoir.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.720
Well, we know from experience.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.170
What happens if I put a hot cup
of water, and it's sharing

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.120
a wall with a cold glass of
water, or cold cube of water,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.090
what happens?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.729
Well, their temperatures
equalize.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.660
If these are the same substance,
we'll end up

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.960
roughly in between, if they're
in the same phase.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960
So essentially, we have a
transfer of heat from the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.720
hotter substance to the
colder substance.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.290
So we have some heat, Q, that
goes from the hotter substance

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.550
to the colder substance.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.960
You don't see, in everyday
reality, heat going from a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.350
colder substance to a
hotter substance.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.850
If I put an ice cube in, let's
say, some hot tea, you don't

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.760
see the ice cube getting
colder and the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.780
hot tea getting hotter.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.880
You see them both getting to
some equal temperature, which

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.550
essentially the T is giving
heat to the ice cube.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.490
Now in this situation there
are reservoirs, so I'm

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.810
assuming that their temperatures
stay constant.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.780
Which would only be the case
if they were both infinite,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.300
which we know doesn't exist
in the real world.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.950
In the real world, T1's
temperature as it gave heat

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.390
would go down, and T2's
temperature would go up.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.720
But let's just see whether the
second law of thermodynamics

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.770
says that this should happen.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.010
So what's happening here?

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.490
What's the net change
in entropy for T1?

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.790
So the second law of
thermodynamics says that the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.370
change in entropy for the
universe is greater than 0.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.670
But in this case, that's equal
to the change in entropy for

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.310
T1 plus the change in entropy
for-- oh, I shouldn't--

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.150
instead of T1, let me
call it just 1.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.490
For system 1, that's this hot
system up here, plus the

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.730
change in entropy
for system 2.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.990
So what's the change in
entropy for system 1?

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:43.330
It loses Q1 at a high
temperature.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.850
So this equals minus the heat
given to the system is Q over

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.690
some hot temperature T1.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.780
And then we have the heat being
added to the system T2.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.460
So plus Q over T2.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.230
This is the change in entropy
for the system 2, right?

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.260
This guy loses the heat, and is
at temperature 1, which is

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.430
a higher temperature.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.340
This guy gains the heat, and
he is at a temperature 2,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.430
which is a colder temperature.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.399
Now, is this going to
be greater than 0?

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.950
Let's think about
it a little bit.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.070
If I divide-- let
me rewrite this.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.900
So I can rearrange them, so that
we can write this as Q

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.980
over T2 minus this one.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.740
I'm just rearranging it.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.830
Minus Q over T1.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.520
Now, which number is bigger?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.720
T2 to T1?

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.130
Well, T1 is bigger, right?

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.380
This is bigger.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.060
Now, if I have a bigger number,
bigger than this--

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.480
when we use the word
bigger, you have to

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.870
compare it to something.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.590
Now, T1 is bigger than this.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.340
We have the same number
in the numerator

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.050
in both cases, right?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.370
So if I take, let's say, 1
over some, let's say, 1/2

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.350
minus 1/3, we're going
to be bigger than 0.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.830
This is a larger number than
this number, because this has

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:04.635
a bigger denominator.

00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:06.840
You're dividing by
a larger number.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.190
That's a good way to
think about it.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.610
You're dividing this Q by some
number here to get something,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.000
and then you're subtracting
this Q

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.470
divided by a larger number.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.890
So this fraction is going to be
a smaller absolute number.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.770
So this is going to
be greater than 0.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.490
So that tells us the second
law of thermodynamics, it

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.630
verifies this observation we
see in the real world, that

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.360
heat will flow from the hot
body to the cold body.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.990
Now, you might say, hey, Sal.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.100
I have a case that will show
you that you are wrong.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.270
You could say, look.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.660
If I put an air conditioner in a
room-- Let's say this is the

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.780
room, and this is outside.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.230
You'll say, look what the
air conditioner does.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.410
The room is already cold, and
outside is already hot.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.620
But what the air conditioner
does, is it makes the cold

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.490
even colder, and it makes
the hot even hotter.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.680
It takes some Q and it goes
in that direction.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.010
Right?

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.670
It takes heat from the cold
room, and puts it out

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.625
into the hot air.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.560
And you're saying, this defies
the second law of

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.690
thermodynamics.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.040
You have just disproved it.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.790
You deserve a Nobel Prize.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.460
And I would say to you, you're
forgetting one small fact.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.340
This air conditioner inside
here, it has some type of a

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.470
compressor, some type
of an engine, that's

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.210
actively doing this.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.600
It's putting in work to
make this happen.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.040
And this engine right here--
I'll do it in magenta-- it's

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.630
also expelling some more heat.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:47.490
So let's call that
Q of the engine.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.970
So if you wanted to figure out
the total entropy created for

00:06:52.970 --> 00:07:02.870
the universe, it would be the
entropy of the cold room plus

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.870
the change in entropy for
outside-- I'll call it

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.050
outside, maybe I'll call
this, for the room.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.870
Right?

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.590
So you might say, OK.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.520
This change in entropy for the
room, it's giving away heat--

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.700
let's see the room is roughly at
a constant temperature for

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.290
that one millisecond we're
looking at it.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.860
It's giving away some Q at
some temperature T1.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.460
And then-- so that's a minus.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.940
And then this the outside is
gaining some heat at some

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.480
temperature T2.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.440
And so you'll immediately
say, hey.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.110
This number right here is a
smaller number than this one.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.530
Right?

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.610
Because the denominator
is higher.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.570
So if you just look at this,
this would be negative

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.300
entropy, and you'd say hey, this
defies the second law of

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.150
thermodynamics.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.650
No!

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.470
But what you have to throw in
here is another notion.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.660
You have to throw in here the
notion that the outside is

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.900
also getting this heat from the
engine over the outside

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.990
temperature.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.980
And this term, I can guarantee
you-- I'm not giving you

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.460
numbers right now--
will make this

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.330
whole expression positive.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.430
This term will turn the total
net entropy to the universe to

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.770
be positive.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.050
Now let's think a little bit how
about what entropy is and

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.830
what entropy isn't in
terms of words.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.840
So when you take an intro
chemistry class, the teacher

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.000
often says, entropy
equals disorder.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.770
Which is not incorrect.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.210
It is disorder, but you have
to be very careful what we

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.830
mean by disorder.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.429
Because the very next example
that's often given is that

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:40.090
they'll say, look.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.090
A clean room-- let's say your
bedroom is clean, and then it

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:45.920
becomes dirty.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.950
And they'll say, look.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.850
The universe became
more disordered.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:53.370
The dirty room has more disorder
than the clean room.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.980
And this is not a case
of entropy increase.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.673
So this is not a good example.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.230
Why is that?

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.670
Because clean and dirty are
just states of the room.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.720
Remember, entropy is a
macro state variable.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.720
It's something you use to
describe a system where you're

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.430
not in the mood to sit there and
tell me what exactly every

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.800
particle is doing.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.200
And this is a macro variable
that actually tells me how

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.430
much time would it take for
me to tell you what every

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:28.290
particle is doing.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.610
It actually tells you how many
states there are, or how much

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.820
information I would have
to give you to tell

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.470
you the exact state.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.480
Now, when you have a clean room
and a dirty room, these

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.590
are two different states
of the same room.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.800
If the room has the same
temperature, and it has the

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.580
same number of molecules in it
and everything, then they have

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.450
the same entropy.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.930
So clean to dirty, it's
not more entropy.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.530
Now, for example, I could
have a dirty, cold room.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.630
And let's say I were to go into
that room and, you know,

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.950
I work really hard
to clean it up.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.980
And by doing so, I add a lot of
heat to the system, and my

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.810
sweat molecules drop all over
the place, and so there's just

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.240
more stuff in that room, and
it's all warmed up to me-- so

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:22.810
to a hot, clean room with sweat
in it-- so it's got more

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.350
stuff in here that can be
configured in more ways, and

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.620
because it's hot, every molecule
in the room can take

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.850
on more states, right?

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.420
Because the average kinetic
energy is up, so they can kind

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.070
of explore the spaces of how
many kinetic energies it can

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.700
have. There's more potential
energies that each molecule

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.240
can take on.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.610
This is actually an increase
in entropy.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.410
From a dirty, cold room
to a hot, clean room.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.410
And this actually goes well
with what we know.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.720
I mean, when I go into room and
I start cleaning it, I am

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.080
in putting heat into the room.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.140
And the universe is becoming
more-- I guess we could say

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.720
it's the entropy
is increasing.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.030
So where does the term
disorder apply?

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.330
Well, let's take a situation
where I take a ball.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.520
I take a ball, and it
falls to the ground.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.570
And then it hits the ground.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.050
And there should have been a
question that you've been

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.160
asking all the time, since the
first law of thermodynamics.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.360
So the ball hits the
ground, right?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.520
It got thrown up, it had some
potential energy at the top,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.380
then that all gets turned into
kinetic energy and it hits the

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.120
ground, and then it stops.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.410
And so your obvious question is,
what happened to all that

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.880
energy, right?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.430
Law of conservation of energy.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.380
Where did all of it go?

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.890
It had all that kinetic energy
right before it hit the

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.350
ground, then it stopped.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.760
Right?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.290
It seems like it disappeared.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.950
But it didn't disappear.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.260
So when the ball was falling, it
had a bunch of-- you know,

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.470
everything had a little
bit of heat.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.960
But let's say the ground
was reasonably ordered.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.260
The ground molecules were
vibrating with some kinetic

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.100
energy and potential energies.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.650
And then our ball molecules
were also

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.480
vibrating a little bit.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.340
But most of their motion
was downwards, right?

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.160
Most of the ball molecules'
motion was downwards.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.220
Now, when it hits the ground,
what happens-- let me show you

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.230
the interface of the ball.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.790
So the ball molecules at the
front of the ball are going to

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.400
look like that.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.730
And there's a bunch of them.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.460
It's a solid.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.100
It will maybe be some
type of lattice.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.740
And then it hits the ground.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.150
And when it hits the ground-- so
the ground is another solid

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.960
like that-- All right, we're
looking at the microstate.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.370
What's going to happen?

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.390
These guys are going to rub
up against these guys, and

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.880
they're going to transfer
their-- what was downward

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.090
kinetic energy, and a very
ordered downward kinetic

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.510
energy-- they're going
to transfer it to

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.110
these ground particles.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.950
And they're going to bump into
the ground particles.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.040
And so when this guy bumps into
that guy, he might start

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.910
moving in that direction.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.910
This guy will start oscillating
in that direction,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.770
and go back and forth
like that.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.300
That guy might bounce off of
this guy, and go in that

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.190
direction, and bump
into that guy, and

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.380
go into that direction.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.410
And then, because that guy
bumped here, this guy bumps

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.860
here, and because this guy bumps
here, this guy bumps

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.760
over there.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.820
And so what you have is, what
was relatively ordered motion,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.210
especially from the ball's point
of view, when it starts

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.280
rubbing up against these
molecules of the ground, it

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.855
starts making the kinetic
energy, or their movement, go

00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:26.760
in all sorts of random
directions.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.090
Right?

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.130
This guy's going to make this
guy go like that, and that guy

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.170
go like that.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.570
And so when the movement is no
longer ordered, if I have a

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.550
lot of molecules-- let me do it
in a different color-- if I

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.520
have a lot of molecules, and
they're all moving in the

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.910
exact same direction, then my
micro state looks like my

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.590
macro state.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.850
The whole thing moves
in that direction.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.860
Now, if I have a bunch of
molecules, and they're all

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.900
moving in random directions,
my ball as a whole will be

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.320
stationary.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.330
I could have the exact same
amount of kinetic energy at

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.740
the molecular level, but
they're all going to be

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.670
bouncing into each other.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.520
And in this case, we described
the kinetic energy as internal

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.140
energy, or we describe it as
temperature, where temperature

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.980
is the average kinetic energy.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.500
So in this case, when we talk
about, the world is becoming

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.650
more disordered, you think about
the order of maybe the

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.110
velocities or the energies
of the molecules.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.810
Before they were reasonably
ordered, the molecules-- they

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.210
might have been vibrating a
little bit, but they were

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.050
mainly going down in the ball.

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.490
But when they bump into the
ground, all of a sudden they

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.740
start vibrating in random
directions a little bit more.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.760
And they make the ground
vibrate in more random

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.600
directions.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.800
So it makes-- at the
microstate-- everything became

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.010
just that much more
disordered.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.530
Now there's an interesting
question here.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:41.830
There is some probability you
might think-- Look, this ball

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.250
came down and hit the ground.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.280
Why doesn't the ball just--
isn't there some probability

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.950
that if I have a ground, that
these molecules just rearrange

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:56.880
themselves in just the right
way to just hit these ball

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.190
molecules in just
the right way?

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.810
There's some probability, just
from the random movement, that

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.520
at get some second, all the
ground molecules just hit the

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.710
ball molecules just right to
send the ball back up.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.200
And the answer is yes.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.400
There's actually some
infinitesimally small chance

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.340
that that happens.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.790
That you could have a ball
that's sitting on the ground--

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.390
and this is interesting--
could have a ball that's

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.990
sitting on the ground, and while
you're looking, you'll

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.740
probably have to wait a few
gazillion years for it to

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.440
happen, if it happens at all--
it could just randomly pop up.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.160
And there's some random, very
small chance that these

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.310
molecules just randomly vibrate
in just the right way

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.960
to be ordered for a second, and
then the ball will pop up.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.270
But the probability of this
happening, relative to

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.740
everything else, is
essentially 0.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.520
So when people talk about
order and disorder, the

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.040
disorder is increasing, because
now these molecules

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.640
are going in more random
directions, and they can take

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.770
on more potential states.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.460
And we saw that here.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.970
And you know, on some level,
entropy seems something kind

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.630
of magical, but on some
level, it seems

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.900
relatively common sense.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.210
In that video-- I think was the
last video-- I had a case

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.580
where I had a bunch of
molecules, and then I had this

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.000
extra space here, and then
I removed the wall.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.760
And we saw that these molecules
will-- we know,

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.220
there's always some modules
that are bouncing off this

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.430
wall before, because we probably
had some pressure

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.640
associated with it.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.790
And then as soon as we remove
that wall, the molecule that

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.910
would have bounced there
just keeps going.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.170
There's nothing to stop
it from there.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.410
In that direction, there's
a lot of stuff.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.180
It could bump into other
molecules, and it could

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.410
bumping into these walls.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.190
But in this direction, the
odds of it bumping into

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.020
everything is, especially for
these leading molecules, is

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.710
essentially 0.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.690
So it's going to expand
to fill the container.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.640
So that's kind of
common sense.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.500
But the neat thing is that the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.170
as we saw in that video, also
says that this will happen.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.520
That the molecules will all
expand to fill the container.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.270
And that the odds of this
happening are very low.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:11.030
That they all come back and
go into a ordered state.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.470
Now there is some chance, just
from the random movements once

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.710
they fill, that they all just
happen to come back here.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.099
But it's a very, very
small probability.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.160
And even more-- and I want to
make this very clear-- S is a

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.410
macro state.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.410
We never talk about
the entropy for

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.010
an individual molecule.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:32.310
If we know what an individual
molecule is doing, we

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.500
shouldn't be worrying
about entropy.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.610
We should be worrying about
the system as a whole.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.400
So even if we're looking at
the system, if we're not

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.470
looking directly at the
molecules, we won't even know

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.940
that this actually happened.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.920
All we can do is look
at the statistical

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.110
properties of the molecules.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.460
How many molecules they are,
what their temperature is, all

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.750
their macro dynamics,
the pressure, and

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.560
say, you know what?

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.700
A box that has these molecules
has more state than a smaller

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.740
box, than the box when we
had the wall there.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.520
Even if, by chance, all of the
molecules happened to be

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.580
collecting over there, we
wouldn't know that that

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.920
happened, because we're not
looking at the micro states.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.150
And that's a really important
thing to consider.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.130
When someone says that a dirty
room has a higher entropy than

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.510
a clean room, they're looking
at the micro states.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.070
And entropy essentially is
a macro state variable.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.890
You could just say
that a room has a

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.650
certain amount of entropy.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:32.160
So entropy is associated with
the room, and it's only useful

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.640
when you really don't
know exactly what's

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.390
going on in the room.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.040
You just have a general sense of
how much stuff there is in

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.020
the room, what's the temperature
of the room,

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.550
what's the pressure
in the room.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.750
Just the general macro
properties.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.910
And then entropy will
essentially tell us how many

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.120
possible micro states that
macro system can actually

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.380
have. Or how much information--
and there's a

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.150
notion of information entropy--
how much information

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.970
would I have to give you to tell
you what the exact micro

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.250
state is of a system at
that point in time.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.780
Well anyway.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:05.330
Hopefully you found this
discussion a little bit

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.710
useful, and it clears up some
misconceptions about entropy,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.720
and gives you a little bit more
intuition about what it

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.780
actually is.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.590
See you in the next video.
