00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.535
We are asked, what number set
does the number 8 belong to?

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:05.910
So this is actually
a good review

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.180
of the different sets of numbers
that we often talk about.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.129
So the first set
under consideration

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.730
is the natural numbers.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.729
And these are essentially
the counting numbers,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.070
and you're not counting 0.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.050
So just if you were
actually to count objects,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.630
and you have at
least one of them,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.296
we're talking about
the natural numbers.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:30.400
So that would be 1, 2,
3, so on and so forth.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.400
So clearly, 8 is
a natural number.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.250
You can count up to 8 here.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.270
You could count 8 objects.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.960
So 8 is a member of
the natural numbers.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.360
The next one we
should consider, let's

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.070
consider the whole
numbers right over here.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.880
And I should say
natural numbers.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.560
So let's consider
the whole numbers.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.934
The whole numbers
are essentially

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:03.650
the same thing as
the natural numbers,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.860
but we're now
going to include 0.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.260
So this is 0, 1, 2,
3, so on and so forth.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.400
So clearly, 8 is one
of these as well.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.990
You could eventually
increment your way to 8,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.240
like you're just counting
all of the whole numbers.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.179
Another way to view this is
the non-negative numbers.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.530
So 8 clearly belongs
to this as well.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.100
So let's expand our
set a little bit.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.225
Let's think about integers.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.430
Now these are all the
numbers starting with,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.700
well you could keep counting
down, all the way up

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.780
to negative 3, negative
2, negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.300
and you could just
keep going there.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.187
Now clearly, 8 is
one of these as well.

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:48.520
You can just keep counting to 8.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520
In fact, let me just
put our check box there.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.700
In general, you
have your integers

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.850
that contain both the positive
and the negative numbers and 0,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.539
depending on
whether you consider

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.720
that positive or
negative, or neither.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.970
So that's the integers,
right over here.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.465
And then the whole numbers
is a subset of the integers.

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.370
So I'll draw it like this.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.010
The whole numbers
are right over here,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.170
that is the whole numbers.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.589
We've now excluded all
of the negative numbers.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.540
So these are all the
non-negative numbers.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.019
All the non-negative
integers, I should say.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.490
So these are the whole numbers.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.020
And then the natural numbers
are a subset of that.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.380
It's essentially everything.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.380
So the only thing that's
in whole numbers that's

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.560
not in the natural numbers
is just the number 0.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.710
So this whole area
right here just

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.340
corresponds to the number 0.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.270
So it really should
be a bit of a point.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.270
So let me make it clear.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.330
This circle is
the whole numbers,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.040
and then I have the
natural numbers,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.519
which is a subset of that.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.490
Obviously this isn't
drawn to scale.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.210
The natural numbers
is a subset of that.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.610
8 is a member of all of them.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.630
8 is sitting right over here.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.000
So it's a member of the
natural numbers, whole numbers,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.365
and the integers.

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:09.160
Now let's keep expanding things.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.995
Let's talk about
rational numbers.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.239
Now these are numbers that
can be expressed in the form p

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.090
over q, where both p
and q are integers.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.330
So can 8 be expressed this way?

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:37.420
Well, you can express
8 as 8 over 1.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.459
Or actually 16 over 2.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.620
Or you could just
keep going, 32 over 4,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.140
you can express it as a
bunch of p's over q's, where

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.070
both the p and q are integers.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.140
So it's definitely
a rational number.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.739
And in fact, all of these things
over here are rational numbers.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.940
So let me draw.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.940
So this is all a subset
of rational numbers.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.130
So 8 is definitely a
member of that as well.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.920
Rational numbers, so let me
put the check box over here.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.329
Now what about
irrational numbers?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.900
Irrational numbers.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.560
Well, by definition, these are
numbers that are not rational.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.050
These are numbers that cannot
be expressed in this form,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.959
where p and q are integers.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.880
So if something is rational,
it just cannot be irrational.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.110
So 8 is not a member of
the irrational numbers.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.900
The irrational numbers are
just a completely separate set

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.039
over here.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.980
So I would draw it like this.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.700
This area right over
here, this would

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.150
be the irrational numbers.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.349
Irrational.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.350
Rational is not a subset of
irrational, they are exclusive.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.800
You can't be in both sets.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.830
So that's irrational
right over there.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.996
And then finally let's ask, is
8 a member of the real numbers?

00:04:52.997 --> 00:04:55.080
Now the real numbers are
essentially all of these.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.810
It's combining both the
rational and the irrational.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.590
So the real numbers is all
of this right over here.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.270
And so 8 is clearly
a member of the real.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.609
It's a member of the
real, and within the real,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.310
you either can be rational or
irrational, 8 it is rational.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.070
It's an integer.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.490
It's a whole number.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.010
And it is a natural number.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.909
So it's definitely a
member of the reals.

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.450
And just to give
you might be saying,

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.130
hey well, what is an
irrational number then?

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.260
Can't almost every number
be represented like this?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.980
Or every number you can think
of be represented like this?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.480
And an example of maybe
the most famous example

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.890
of an irrational number is pi.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.599
Pi is equal to 3.14159, and
people devote their lives

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.490
to memorizing the digits of pi.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.330
But what makes this irrational
is you can't represent it

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.130
as a ratio, or as a
rational expression,

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.890
of integers, the way you
can for rational numbers.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.650
And this right here
is non-repeating.

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.130
And if it was
repeating, you actually

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.310
could express it as
a ratio of integers,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.000
and we do that in other videos.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.960
It is non-repeating
and non terminating,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.664
so you never run out digits to
the right of the decimal point.

00:06:09.664 --> 00:06:11.830
So this would be an example
of an irrational number.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.190
So pi would sit here
in the irrationals.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.870
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
