00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.667
Everything in human experience, and really human history or human civilizations experience, is that everything

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:15.933
seems to fall to the earth, that if you have water particles, they don't just float up.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:16.433
If they are small enough they are being held up by the wind and all that, but if they are large enough, they will fall.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:25.733
That you don't have people that are able to just float around, they will fall.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.400
You don't have taxi cabs that float around, they'll fall.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.467
Not only will the water fall, it will hit the ground, it will puddle up, and if there is a gutter it

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:38.200
will fall into the gutter. It is just trying to get lower and lower and lower.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.733
If i were to drop a bunch of needles they would just fall. They don't... If i had a needle at rest here

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:49.333
it doesn't just automatically for no reason jump and fly upwards and start to float.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:53.667
And so it is just a thing that is fundamental to everything that we have ever

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.933
ever experienced.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:01:03.333
And so, for most of human history or human civilization, we just accepted it as a given.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:10.133
We thought, "well look it's just obvious, everything should just fall down, that's just the way the universe is.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:18.933
To think otherwise would just be crazy." And that's why this guy, this guy right over here, is one of the greatest geniuses

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.600
of all time. He did many more things than just the things I am going to describe in this video,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.867
and any one of those things would have earned him his place in history.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:31.667
And this, as you may already know, is Isaac Newton.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:38.467
Easily one of the top five minds in all of human history. So a pretty fascinating dude.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:43.236
And one of his big insights about this 'things falling down' problem is:

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.041
Do they have to fall down?

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:49.467
Is this just something we should assume about the universe?

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:58.133
Things just need to fall down, he said, or we were told he said that he was somewhat inspired by

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:05.000
observing an apple falling from a tree. It's probably not true that you'll see in some cartoons

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.923
on television that the apple hit his head or hit his head while he was sleeping and gave him the idea.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:15.800
Most people were to see... Let me draw a tree here.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:30.333
That's a twig right there, some leaves. So if most people... So that is an apple over here.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:38.067
So if most people... If i were to snap this twig over here, the apple would fall. Pretty much common sense. The apple would fall.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:44.067
And if most people were to see that, they would just think it's a normal happening in the universe. But for Isaac Newton, at least on that day,

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:50.600
he asked himself, "Why? Why did that apple fall?"

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.267
And this, to some degree, is a great example of "out of the box" thinking, because something

00:02:54.267 --> 00:03:00.133
for thousands of years or tens of thousands of years human beings had taken for granted, just

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.733
because that's the way it always was. He actually asked the question why?

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:07.067
Does it always have to be that way?

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:11.933
And that question took him down a entire line of reasoning that set up the basis for all of

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:15.867
classical mechanics for the most part we still use today.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:20.733
It has been tweaked a good bit by this gentleman in the last hundred years. [Albert Einstein]

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:26.067
But for most purposes, when we're engineering things on the surface of the planet,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:35.745
and we are not going close to the speed of light, we can still use the mathematics that Isaac Newton came up with from this simple question.

00:03:35.822 --> 00:03:39.939
And not only was he able to kind of think that there's something...

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.912
There's something that might be pulling, somehow,

00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:45.930
acting on this apple, bringing it to the earth.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.599
But he actually formulated an entire, an entire.. I guess

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.943
Law around this thing. So, as you can imagine,

00:03:52.943 --> 00:03:58.796
the thing that Isaac Newton believes brought the apple to the Earth

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.710
is gravity... is gravity.

00:04:01.988 --> 00:04:05.311
And he formulated the universal Law of gravitation, or the law of universal gravitation; either way.

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:14.267
And in it, he theorizes that the forces between objects

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:17.733
now it's a vector quantity, it's always going to attract the two objects to each other.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:23.800
So the direction is towards each other. The force of gravity between two objects...

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:33.000
is going to be equal to this this big G, which is really just a number, its a very small number.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.200
I'll give you that number in a second. It's equal to this constant, this gravitation constant.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:49.133
Which is a super-duper small number, times the mass of the first object, times the mass of the second

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:57.800
object, divided by the distance between the two objects. Distance squared.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:09.067
So this is distance between two objects.

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:14.333
So if you're talking about the force of gravity on Earth, this right over here...

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:21.800
You pick one of the masses to be Earth, so this mass over here. You pick one to be Earth.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.200
This is the object on Earth. Maybe it's me. Then this is the distance between the center

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:38.933
of masses between those two objects. The center of me and center of the Earth.

00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.467
So really it's from roughly the distance from the surface of the Earth or if I'm roughly

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:47.000
five foot-nine [inches tall] then about half of that distance to the center of the Earth

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.867
is this number right over here. So right when you see this, before we even talk about me and Earth,

00:05:54.867 --> 00:06:01.067
or needles and Earth, or taxi cabs and Earth and that force of gravity, you might have something

00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:07.867
bizarre raising up in your brain. You might be saying, "the way gravity is defined

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:14.400
by Isaac Newton, this formula we're given right here, it's saying we have gravity between

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.867
any two objects" and you're saying, "Look, I'm looking at a computer screen right now,

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:30.200
so you're looking at a computer screen right now..." And let me draw an old school computer,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.800
not a flat panel. How come your not attracted to the computer screen?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.333
How come it doesn't fly into your face? And the answer there is, this number, this number is

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:52.600
really small. And there actually is some force of attraction between you and the computer.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:00.067
It's just that it's more than overcompensated for the friction between the computer and the desk,

00:07:00.067 --> 00:07:06.067
the friction between you and your seat, which is frankly being caused by the force

00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:12.067
between you and the Earth, the force of gravitation between the computer and the Earth.

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:17.333
That you and the computer have such small masses that you really can't notice it. It's really negligible.

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:23.533
It's being overpowered by other forces that are keeping the computer from even drifting

00:07:23.533 --> 00:07:29.600
into your face or your face drifting into the computer. So just to get a sense of that...

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.000
This G, this big G,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.733
this constant of proportionality, just to get a sense of how small it is... This is, and I'm going to round

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:50.667
it here, it's approximately 6.67 times 10 to the negative 11th Newtons.

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.667
And we'll talk about Newtons, it is the metric unit of force.

00:07:53.667 --> 00:08:09.200
Let me actually make sure I say this correctly. Newton meters per kilogram squared. Newton times meter per kilogram, squared.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.400
It's this strange set of units here, but the units are really there. So when you multiply by two masses,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.400
which are in kilograms, and divide by a distance, which is in meters, you'll end up with Newtons.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.933
But I want to make it clear that this is a super small number.

00:08:22.933 --> 00:08:29.000
Ten to the negative 11th. If I were to just write 10 to the negative 11th, it would be 0.0 and

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:46.133
then we would have eleven 0's. So this number right here is the same as 6.67 times

00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:54.333
this thing over here. So this is a super small number. And that is why if you multipy it by not so

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.733
large numbers, if you don't use Earth, if you use yourself and a computer,

00:08:57.733 --> 00:09:04.667
you're going to end up still with a super duper small force. Something so small that you won't

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:08.133
notice it. It is going to be overpowered by other forces, so these things don't fly into each other.

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:14.267
But when you think about really massive bodies, like the Earth, the force of gravity

00:09:14.267 --> 00:09:19.600
starts to become noticeable, very noticeable. And I'm not going to give you the mass of Earth in this

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.733
video, you can look it up yourself. But if you put in the mass of Earth right over here,

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:30.933
if you put it in right over there, and if you put in roughly the distance from the surface

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:37.933
of the Earth to the center of the Earth for R, and you multiply that by G. All of these terms over here...

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:44.600
So this term, if you multiply that times that term and multiply by this term squared,

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:53.000
they simplify to what is sometimes called little g. Little g. So this right here, we can view that

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.400
as the gravitational field at the surface of Earth. It's also the same thing as the acceleration

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.933
of gravity at the surface of the Earth, and this, and once again I'm just going to round it

00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:09.867
for the sake... This is... This comes out to be, units wise, 9.8 meters per second squared.

00:10:09.867 --> 00:10:18.267
Then you're left with just the other mass. So times M1. So for simplicity, if something

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:28.000
is close to the surface of the Earth, the distance does matter. We can say that the force of

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.600
gravity can be this "little g" times whatever the mass is close to Earth. For example,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:44.933
if you were to take me, and I weighed 70 kilograms... So, in the case of Sal, Sal has a...Actually I

00:10:44.933 --> 00:10:51.400
shouldn't say weight, I have a mass of 70 kilograms. I have a mass of 70 kilograms.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.667
Weight is actually a force, but we'll talk about that, clarify that more later.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:11:03.733
My mass is 70 kilograms, then we can figure out the force that the Earth is pulling down on me

00:11:03.733 --> 00:11:10.733
which is actually my weight. So in this situation, the force is going to be g, which is 9.8 meters

00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:27.400
per second squared, times my mass, which is 70 kilograms. And let me get my handy T85 calculator

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:42.067
out to figure this out. So I get 9.8 times 70. That gives me...686. So this is equal to 686

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:53.400
kilogram meters per second squared. OR this is the exact same thing as this thing right over here.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:12:00.867
This IS the definition of a Newton. So this is a newton, which is appropriately named for

00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:04.000
the guy that is the Father of All Classical Physics.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So my weight on Earth, which is the same thing as the force that Earth is pulling down on me,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:22.400
or that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and me is 686 newtons. Now I will ask you

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.333
an interesting question.

00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:31.267
So here is Earth,

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:33.867
and I am not even a speck of a speck on Earth, but say for simplicity let's say

00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:40.133
this is me, I'm hanging out in the Indian Ocean some place. So that is me.

00:12:40.133 --> 00:12:49.267
And we already know that Earth is pulling down on me with a force of 686 newtons.

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:57.133
Now my question to you is, "Am I pulling on the Earth with any force? And am I pulling on the Earth with

00:12:57.133 --> 00:13:01.067
a larger or small force that is pulling on me?"

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:08.200
And your gut or your knee-jerk reaction might be: Earth is so huge, Sal is so tiny.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:14.333
Clearly the Earth must be pulling with a greater force than Sal is pulling on the Earth.

00:13:14.333 --> 00:13:17.800
Unfortunately that is NOT the case.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:26.733
That I am. So the Earth is pulling on Sal with the force of 686 Newtons and Sal is also pulling on the

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:34.067
Earth with a force of 686 Newtons. So Sal is also pulling on the Earth. It makes me feel very powerful

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:39.333
with the force of 686 Newtons. But you might say, "Wait, that doesn't make sense, Sal."

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:47.733
If I have a building over here, and if you were to, let's say, jump from the building, you're going to start...

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:52.400
The force of gravity is going to be acting on you, and you're going to start accelerating downwards.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.333
It doesn't seem that the Earth is accelerating up to you. Wouldn't we notice that, every time someone

00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:03.067
were to jump off a building, that the Earth starting accelerating in a major way. And the way to think

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:06.867
about that is that the force is the SAME. And we'll talk about that in other videos.

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:17.400
Force is equal to mass times acceleration. So when we are talking about 686 Newtons, in terms of

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:23.400
the force of Earth, the gravitational attraction between myself and Earth. And this is going to be

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:30.467
68 kilograms, then this provides a pretty good acceleration on me. So in this case, if you

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:39.600
solve for A... Solve for A over here. You're going to get 9.8 meters per second squared. Now, if you

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.867
do the same thing for Earth... I already told you that we are pulling on each other with the same

00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:49.867
force, 686 Newtons. Now if you want to find out how much is the Earth accelerating... That force

00:14:49.867 --> 00:14:54.400
you're going to get a... I'm not even going to put it here. You're going to put a huge number

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:04.000
in here. Huge number times the acceleration of Earth towards me. And since this is such a huge number,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.467
very very very large number, this is going to be an immeasurably small number, super small number.

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:16.133
And frankly it's probably averaged out by the acceleration of Earth, or the force of gravity

00:15:16.133 --> 00:15:26.467
and all the other people and things on the surface of the planet. So it all averages out in the end.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.800
But even if it didn't, it would be negligible, you wouldn't even notice the acceleration of Earth

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:36.533
towards me. But you would notice the acceleration of me towards Earth because of our vastly

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:41.867
different masses. Even though we have the same force of attraction.
