00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.400
 

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
In the last video, we hopefully
got ourselves a respectable

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.760
understanding of how a
vector-valued function works,

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.340
or even better, a position
vector-valued function, that

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.460
is, in some ways, a
replacement for traditional

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.110
parameterization to
describe a curve.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.050
And what I want to do in this
video is just get a little bit

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.910
of gut sense of what it means
to take of a derivative of

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.730
a vector-valued function.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.190
In this case, it'll be with
respect to our parameter t.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.510
So let me draw some
new stuff right here.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.580
So let's say I have the
vector-valued function r of t,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.450
and this is no different than
what I did in last video. x of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.830
t times unit vector i plus y of
t times the unit vector j.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.460
If we were doing it in 3
dimensions, we'd add a z of t

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.510
times k, but let's keep things
relatively simple, and let's

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
say that this describes a
curve, and let's say the curve

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.630
we're dealing with, t is
between a and b, and this curve

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.870
will look something like, let
me do my best effort to draw

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.600
the curve, I'll just draw some
random curve here, so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.900
let's say the curve looks
something like that.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.890
This is when t is equal
to a, so it's going to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.750
go in this direction.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.620
This is when t is equal to b
right here, this is t is equal

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.790
to a, so this right here would
be x of a, this right here is y

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.730
of a, and similarly, this up
here, this is x of b, and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.240
this over here is y of b.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.150
Now, we saw in the last video
that the endpoints of these

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
position vectors are what's
describing this curve.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.400
So r of a we saw in the
last video, it describes

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.300
that point right there.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.270
I don't want to review
that too much.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.800
But what I want to do is
think about, what is the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.930
difference between 2 points?

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.410
So let's say that we take
some random point here.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.760
Let's say, some random t here.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.780
Let's call that r of t.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.197
Well actually, I'm going to do
a different point, just because

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.100
I want to make it a
little bit clearer.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.370
So let's say-- I'm going to
switch colors-- let's say

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.080
that that right there
is r of some t.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.980
Some particular t, right there.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.410
That is r of t.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.050
It's going to be, you
know, a plus something.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.950
So that's some a particular t.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.080
And let's say that we want to
figure out, and let's say we

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.560
increase t by a little bit.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.650
By h.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.250
So let's say that r of t plus
h, well, if we view the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.430
parameter t as time, we've
moved in forward in time by

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.310
some amount, so our little
particle has moved

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.180
a little bit.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.650
And let's say that
we're over here.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.530
So that is that right there,
in yellow, is r of t plus h.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.360
Just a slightly
larger value for h.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.040
Now, one question we might ask
ourselves, is how quickly is r

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.650
changing with respect to t?

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.380
So the first thing we might
want to say, well, what's the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.550
difference between these two?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.010
If I were to take, and I
want to visualize it.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.880
If I were to take r, the
position vector, that we get by

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.080
evaluating r at t plus h, and
from that, I would

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.590
subtract r of t.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.580
 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.690
What do we get?

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.730
Well, you might want to review
some of your vector algebra

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.130
but we're essentially just
going to get this vector.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.210
Let me do it in a
nice, vibrant color.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.820
We're going to get this
vector right there, that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.320
I'm doing in magenta.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.010
So that magenta vector right
there is, let me do it, that

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.080
magenta one right there,
is the vector r of t

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.120
plus h minus r of t.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.110
And it should make sense,
because when you add vectors,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.050
you go heads to tails.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.060
You could alternatively write
this as r of t plus this

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.490
character right here, plus r
of t plus h minus r of t.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.630
When you add two vectors,
you're adding, let me make

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.180
it very clear, I'm adding
this vector to this

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.350
vector right here.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.260
You put the tail of the
second vector at the

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.450
head of the first.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.850
So this is the first vector,
and I put the tail of the

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.000
second there, and then the sum
of those two, as we predicted,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.470
should be equal to
this last one.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.050
It should be equal
to r of t plus h.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.000
And we see that is the case,
and algebraically, you would

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.240
see that obviously this
guy and that guy are

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.080
going to cancel out.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.270
So hopefully that
satisfies you.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.510
And I want to be clear.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.450
This, all of a sudden, this
isn't a position vector.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.560
We're not saying that hey,
let's nail this guy's tail at

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.870
the origin and use this guy to
describe a unique position.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.610
Now all of a sudden he's, it's
just kind of a pure vector.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.700
It's describing just
a change between two

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.140
other position vectors.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.790
So this guy is right out here.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.930
But this vector literally
describes the change.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.070
But say we care, and how would
this look algebraically if we

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.460
were to expand it like that?

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.740
So this is going to be equal
to, what's r of t plus h?

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.520
That's the same thing as x
of, let me do it over here.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.190
This is the same thing as x of
t plus h times the unit vector

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.040
i plus y of t plus h times the
unit vector j, that's just that

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.570
piece, that piece right there
is that piece, minus this

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.300
piece, so minus, I'll do it in
the second line, I could have

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.240
done it out here, but I'm
running out of space.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.650
Minus x of t, right r of t is
just x of t times i, plus, but

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.700
I'll just distribute the minus
sign, so it's minus

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.690
y of t times j.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.660
Actually let me write it,
this would be minus, let me

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.130
write this way, plus this.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.200
So you realize that this
is really just this

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.950
guy right here.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.200
I'm just evaluating at t.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.030
So you have x of t and y
of t, and then later we

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.970
can distribute, right?

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.255
If you distribute this minus
sign, you get a minus x

00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:15.920
of t and a minus y of t.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.380
And in vector addition, you
might need a little review on

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.920
this if you haven't seen it in
a while, you know that you can

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.990
just add the corresponding
components.

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.450
You can add the x-components
and you can add

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.750
the y-components.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.790
So this is going to be equal
to, let me rewrite it over

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.810
here, because I think I'm going
to need some space later on.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.510
So let me rewrite it over here.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.930
So I have r of t plus h minus r
of t is equal to, and I'm just

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.100
going to group the x- and the
y-components, this is equal to

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.920
the x-components added
together, but this is a

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.400
negative, so we're going to
subtract this guy

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.100
from that guy.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:02.400
So x of t plus h minus x of t,
and then all of that times our

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.840
unit vector in the x-direction,
and then we'll have plus y of t

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.900
plus h minus y of t times a
unit vector the j-direction,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.490
I'm just rearranging things
right now, and this will tell

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.870
us what is our change between
any 2 r's for given

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.610
change in distance.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.140
And our change in distance
here is h between any

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.000
2 position vectors.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.500
Now, what I set out at the
beginning of this video, I

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.100
said, well, I wanted to figure
out the change, and we're going

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.990
to think about the
instantaneous change

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.790
with respect to t.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.920
So I want to see, well,
how much did this change

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.570
over a period of h?

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.750
Instead of writing h we could
have written delta t, it

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.010
would've been the same thing.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.570
So I want to divide this by h.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.410
So I want to say, look.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.200
My vectors changed this much,
but I want to say it's

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.310
over a period of h.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.250
And this is analogous
to when we do slope.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.090
We say rise over run, over
delta y, or change in

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.290
y, over change in x.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.160
This is kind of the change in
our function per change in x.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.960
Let's just divide everything,
or I shouldn't say change

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.470
x, per change in t.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.100
So here, our change
in t is h, right?

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.290
The difference between t plus h
and t is just going to be h.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.650
And so we're going to
divide everything by h.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.750
When you multiply a vector by
some scalar, or divide it by

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.070
some scalar, or you're just the
taking each of its components

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.140
and multiplying or dividing
by that scalar, and we

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.660
get that right there.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.540
So this, for any finite
difference right here, h,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.300
this'll tell us how much
our vector changes per h.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.220
But if we want to find the
instantaneous change, right,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.230
just like what we did when we
first learned differential

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.520
calculus, we said, ok.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.670
This is kind of
analogous to a slope.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.520
This would be good, this would
work out well for us, if the

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.220
path under question looked
something like this.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.920
If it was a linear path.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.240
If our path looked
something like this.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.800
We could just calculate this,
and we'll essentially have the

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.080
average change in our position
vectors, so you could imagine,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.880
2 position vectors,
that's one of them.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.050
Well, actually, they'd
all be parallel.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:24.470
Well, the position vectors,
they don't have to be parallel.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.740
They could be like that.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.340
And then, this would just
describe the change between

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.940
these 2 per h, or how quickly
are the position vectors

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.230
changing per our change
in our parameter, right?

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.530
This is, the h, you could also
consider, is kind of a delta t.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.050
Sometimes people find the
h simpler, or sometimes

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:44.900
they find the delta t.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.230
But anyway, I'm concerned
with the instantaneous.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.140
We're dealing with curves,
we're dealing with calculus.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.870
This would have been OK
if we were just in an

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.670
algebraic, linear world.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.850
So what do we do?

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.080
Well maybe, we can just take
the limit as h approaches 0.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.760
Let me scroll this over.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.700
So let's just take the limit,
let me do this in a nice

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.910
vibrant color, let's take, I'm
running out of colors, the

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.170
limit as h approaches 0
of both sides of this.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.440
So here, too, I'm going to take
the limit as h approaches 0,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.520
and here, too, I'm going to
take the limit as

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.380
h approaches 0.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.970
So I just want to say, well,
what happens, how much do I

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.866
change per a change in my
parameter t, but what's kind of

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:30.480
the instantaneous change, as
the difference gets smaller

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.280
and smaller and smaller?

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.870
This is exactly what we first
learned when we learned about

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.810
instantaneous slope, or
instantaneous velocity, or

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.330
slope of a tangent line.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.270
Well, this thing looks a little
bit undefined to me, right now.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.260
We haven't defined limits for
vector-valued functions, we

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.820
haven't defined derivatives
for vector-valued functions.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.250
But lucky for us, all of
this stuff here looks

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.160
pretty familiar.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.400
This is actually the
definition of our derivative.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.310
And these are scalar-valued
functions right here.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.340
They're multiplied by vectors,
in order for us to get

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.880
vector-valued functions.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.100
But this right here, by
definition, this is the

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.330
derivative, this
is x prime of t.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.020
Or this is dx dt.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.280
This right here is y
prime of t, or we could

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.950
write that as dy dt.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.520
So all of a sudden we can
define, we can say, and I'm

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.220
being a little hand-wavy here,
but I want to give you the

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.590
intuition, more than anything.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.890
We can say that the derivative,
we can call this expression

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:30.100
right here, as the derivative
of my vector-valued function r

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.440
with respect to t, or we could
call it dr dt, notice I keep

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.170
the vector signs there.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:44.470
This is its derivative, and all
it's going to be equal to, r

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.700
prime of t, is going to be
equal to, well, this is just

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.450
the derivative of x with
respect to t, is equal to x

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.230
prime of t times the x-unit
vector, the horizontal unit

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:01.170
vector, plus y prime of t,
times the y-unit vector, times

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.240
j, the unit vector in the
horizontal direction.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.800
That's a pretty nice
and simple outcome.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.340
But the hard thing may be
to a kind of visualize

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.730
what it represents.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.490
So if we think about what
happens, let me draw a big

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.730
graph, just to get the
visualization in a healthy way.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.310
So let's say my curve looks
something like this.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.700
That's my curve.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.860
And let's say that this is,
we want to figure out the

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.210
instantaneous change at
this point right here.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.550
So that is r of t.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.520
And then if we take r of t plus
h, we saw this already, you

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.740
know, t plus h might be
something like right there.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.090
So this is r of t plus h.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.290
Right now, the difference
between these two, and this is

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.250
just the numerator when you
take the difference, or how

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:55.170
fast we're changing from this
vector to that vector in terms

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.140
of t, and it's hard
to visualize here.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.960
And I'm going to do a whole
video so we can think about

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.160
the magnitudes here.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.200
That might be some vector.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.560
Well, the difference
between these two is

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.070
just going to be that.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.470
But then when you divide it by
h, it's going to be a larger

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.840
vector, right, if we assume
that h is a small number.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.410
Let's say h is less than one.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.410
We're going to get a
larger vector, right?

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.100
But this is kind of the average
change over this time.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.910
But as h gets smaller and
smaller and smaller, this r

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.100
prime of t is going to, its
direction is going to be

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.090
tangential to the curve.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.900
And I think you can
visualize that, right?

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.320
As these two guys get closer
and closer and closer, the dr's

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.790
get smaller, so the change, the
dr, the difference between the

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.220
two, the delta r's, get smaller
and smaller, you can imagine if

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.790
h was even smaller, if
it was right here.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.510
Then all of a sudden, the
difference between those two

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.795
vectors is getting smaller.

00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:50.500
And it's getting more and more
tangential to the curve.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.770
 

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.800
But then we're also dividing by
a smaller h, so the actual

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.670
derivative, as the limit of h
approaches 0, it might be you

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.120
know, maybe it's even a
bigger number there.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.420
And actually, the magnitude
of this vector, it's a

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.720
little hard to visualize.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.510
It's going to be dependent our
parameterization for the curve.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.990
it's not dependent on
the shape of the curve.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.170
The direction of this vector is
dependent on the shape of this

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.860
curve, and the direction, so
the direction, this will

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.460
be tangent to the curve.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.830
Or you could imagine that this
vector is on the tangent

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.220
line to the curve.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.960
The magnitude of it is a little
bit hard to understand.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.050
I'll try to give you a
little bit of intuition on

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.060
that in the next video.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.380
But this is what I want you to
understand right now, because

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.990
we're going to be able to use
this in the future, when we do

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.400
the line integral over
vector-valued functions.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.900
