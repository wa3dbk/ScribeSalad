00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.310
We need to factor negative 4t
squared minus 12t minus 9.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.290
And a good place to start is
to say, well, are there any

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.460
common factors for all
of these terms?

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.270
When you look at them, well
these first two are divisible

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.980
by 4, these last 2 are divisible
by 3, but not all of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.920
them are divisible
any one number.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.270
Will, but you could factor out
a negative 1, but even if you

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.550
factor out a negative 1-- so you
say this is the same thing

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.990
as negative 1, times positive
4t squared plus 12t plus 9--

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
you still end up with a non-one
coefficient out here

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.120
and on the second degree term,
on the t squared term.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.200
So you might want
to immediately

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.110
start grouping this.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.830
And if you did factor it by
grouping, it would work, you

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.500
would get the right answer.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.550
But there is something about
this equation that might pop

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.080
out at you that might make it a
little bit simpler to solve.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.540
And to understand that, let's
take a little bit of a break

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.680
here on the right hand side,
and just think about what

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.690
happens if you take a plus b
times a plus b, if you just

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.060
have a binomial squared.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
Well you have a times a,
which is a squared.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.070
Then you have a times that
b, which is plus ab.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.310
Then you have b times a, which
is the same thing is ab.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.815
And then you have b times b,
or you have b squared.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:28.360
And so if you add these middle
two terms, right here, you're

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.850
left with a squared plus
2ab plus b squared.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.150
This is the square
of a binomial.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.990
Now, does this right here, does
4t squared plus 12t plus

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.400
9 fit this pattern?

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.020
Well the 4t squared
is a squared.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.080
So this right here
is a squared.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.180
If that is a squared right
there, then what

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.345
does a have to be?

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.450
If this is a squared, then a
would be equal to the square

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.150
root of this.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.940
It would be 2t.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.100
And if this is b squared,
let me do that

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.940
in a different color.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.670
If this right here is b
squared, if the 9 is b

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.110
squared, right there,
then that means that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.170
b is equal to 3.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.400
It's equal to the positive
square root of the 9.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.430
Now, this number, right here--
and actually it doesn't have

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.150
to just be equal to 3,
it might have been

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.430
negative 3 as well.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.240
It could be plus or minus 3.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.000
But this number here,
is it 2 times ab?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.330
Right?

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.650
That's the middle term
that we care about.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.010
Is it 2 times ab?

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.890
Well if we multiply 2t
times 3, we get 6t.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.260
And then if we multiply that
times 2, you get 12t.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.600
This right here, 12t, is equal
to 2 times 2t times 3.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.960
It is 2 times ab.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.060
And if this was a negative 3,
we would look to see if this

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.010
was a negative 12, but this
does work for positive 3.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.030
So this it does fit the pattern
of a perfect square.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.060
This is a square
of a binomial.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.590
So if you wanted to factor
this-- the stuff on the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.940
inside, you still have that
negative 1 out there, the 4t

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.490
squared plus 12t plus 9-- you
could immediately say, well

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.880
that's going to be a plus
b times a plus b.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:29.570
Or 2t plus 3 times 2t plus 3, or
you could just say, it's 2t

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.330
plus 3 squared.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.350
It fits this pattern.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.270
And, of course, you can't
forget about this

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.450
negative 1 out here.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.750
You could have also solved it by
grouping, but this might be

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.460
a quicker thing to recognize.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.820
This is a number squared.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.260
That's another number squared.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.600
If you take each of those
numbers that you're squaring,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.910
take their product and multiply
it by 2, you have

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.650
that right there.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.330
So this is a perfect square.
