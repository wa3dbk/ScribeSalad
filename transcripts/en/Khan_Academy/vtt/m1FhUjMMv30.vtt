00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:01.442
- [Voiceover] In the last video

00:00:01.442 --> 00:00:02.620
we took a look at this function

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.855
f of x, y equal x to the fourth

00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:06.889
minus four x squared plus y squared

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:09.653
which has the graph that
you're looking at on the left.

00:00:09.653 --> 00:00:11.404
And we looked for all of the points

00:00:11.404 --> 00:00:13.636
where the gradient is equal to zero.

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:15.468
Which basically means
both partial derivatives

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:17.581
are equal to zero and we solved that

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:20.566
and we found that there
were three different points.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.953
The origin zero, zero,
and then square root

00:00:22.953 --> 00:00:25.321
of two, zero and negative
square root of two, zero

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.029
which corresponds to this origin here

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.566
which is a saddle point and
then these two local minima.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.190
And it seemed like we had
a reasonable explanation

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.572
for why this is a saddle point

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:35.240
and why both of those are local minima.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.025
'Cause we took the
second partial derivative

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:38.815
with respect to x, that
was kind of all over

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:40.728
the board here, second partial derivative

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:42.678
with respect to x, and found that when you

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:45.649
evaluate it at x equals zero
you get a negative number,

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.555
kind of indicating a negative concavity

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:49.223
so it should look like a maximum.

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:50.970
And then when you do the same with

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.671
the second partial derivative of y,

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.290
man I always do this, I
always leave out the squared

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.873
on that lower term there, okay,

00:00:57.873 --> 00:01:01.182
so second partial
derivative with respect to y

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:03.826
you get two as a constant, a positive.

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:05.413
And that kind of indicates that it looks

00:01:05.413 --> 00:01:06.839
like a minimum to y.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:09.275
So that's why, you know, this origin point

00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:10.699
looks like a saddle point
'cause the x direction

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:13.219
and y direction disagree
and when you do this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.093
with the other points
they kind of both agree

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:16.635
that it should look like a minimum.

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:18.222
But I said that's not enough, I said

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:19.405
that you need to take into account

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:20.913
the mixed partial derivative term.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.758
And to see why that's true let me go ahead

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:26.154
and pull up another example for you here.

00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:28.794
So the graph of the function
that you're looking at

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:30.827
right now, it clearly has a saddle point

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:32.895
at the origin that we can see visually,

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:37.571
but when we get the
equation for this function,

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:41.738
the equation is f of x,
y is equal to x squared

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:46.834
plus y squared minus four times xy.

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:50.881
Now let's go ahead and analyze

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.345
the partial differential information

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.767
of this function, we'll just take

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.676
it's partial derivatives, so the partial

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:58.685
with respect to x is equal to,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.578
so we've got, when we
differentiate this term

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:04.709
we get two x, two x, y
looks like a constant,

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.537
we do nothing, and then this last term

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:08.584
looks like negative four times y

00:02:08.584 --> 00:02:12.932
'cause y looks like a
constant, so negative four y.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.215
And when we do the partial derivative

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:18.026
with respect to y, very
similarly we're gonna get two and

00:02:18.026 --> 00:02:20.181
when we differentiate y squared.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.398
Two y, and now we subtract minus four x

00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:24.824
'cause x looks like the constant and y

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:28.735
looks like the variable, minus four x.

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:31.335
Now when we plug in x and
y are each equal to zero,

00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.212
you know, we plug in the origin point

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:35.365
to both of these functions, we see

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:36.589
that they're equal to zero.

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.651
'Cause x is zero, y is
zero, this guy goes to zero.

00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.644
Similarly over here, that goes to zero.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:45.891
So we will indeed get a flat
tangent plane at the origin.

00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:48.376
But now let's take a look at
the second partial derivatives.

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.821
If we do the second
partial derivatives purely

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:53.018
in terms of x and y, so if we take

00:02:53.018 --> 00:02:56.937
the pure second partial derivative of f

00:02:56.937 --> 00:03:00.477
with respect to x squared what we get,

00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:02.753
we look at this expression,
we differentiate

00:03:02.753 --> 00:03:06.214
it with respect to x and we
get a constant positive two

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:08.169
because that y does nothing for us.

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.208
And then similarly, when
we take the second partial

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:13.941
derivative with respect to y,
always forget that squared on

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.644
the bottom, we also get
a constant positive two

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:18.639
because this x does nothing for us

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.083
when we take the derivative
with respect to y.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.871
So we get constant positive two.

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.185
So this would suggest that, you know,

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:26.979
there's positive concavity
in the x direction,

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.052
there's positive concavity
in the y direction,

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:30.432
so it would suggest that, you know,

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:31.936
it looks like an upward smiley face

00:03:31.936 --> 00:03:34.499
from all directions and it
should be a local minimum.

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.168
But when we look at the
graph this isn't true,

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:38.977
it's not a local minimum,
it's a saddle point.

00:03:38.977 --> 00:03:40.770
So what this tells us is that these two

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.844
second partial derivatives aren't enough,

00:03:42.844 --> 00:03:44.186
we need more information.

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:45.525
And what it kinda comes down to is that

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:47.968
this last term here, minus four xy,

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:49.600
oh, actually, I think I made a mistake,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.221
I think I meant to make this plus four xy.

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.801
So let's see, plus four xy
which would influence these.

00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.632
It actually won't make a difference,

00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:00.258
it still gives a saddle point,

00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:02.455
but anyway, we've got
this plus four xy term

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.002
that evidently makes a difference.

00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:05.503
That evidently kind of, influences

00:04:05.503 --> 00:04:07.652
whether this is a local
minimum or a maximum.

00:04:07.652 --> 00:04:10.210
And just to give a loose intuition
for what's going on here.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.709
If instead of writing four here, I wrote,

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.227
I'm gonna write the variable P, okay,

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:17.406
and P is just gonna be some number

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:20.208
and I'm gonna move that variable around.

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:23.909
I'm gonna basically let it
range from zero up to four.

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.349
So right now, as you're looking
at it it's sitting at four.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.100
So I'm gonna pull it
back and kind of let it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.803
range back to zero just to see

00:04:29.803 --> 00:04:33.017
how this influences the graph.

00:04:33.017 --> 00:04:35.094
And we see that once we
pull it back to zero,

00:04:35.094 --> 00:04:36.727
we get something where it kinda reflects

00:04:36.727 --> 00:04:38.721
what you would expect,
where from the x direction

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:40.430
it's a positive smiley
face, from the y direction

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.162
it's also a positive smiley
face and everything's good,

00:04:43.162 --> 00:04:45.199
it looks like the local minimum and it is.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.797
And even as you let P range more and more,

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:50.353
and here P is around,
I'm guessing right now

00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:52.430
it's around 1.5, you get something

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.014
that's still a local minimum.

00:04:54.014 --> 00:04:56.658
It's a positive concavity
in all directions,

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:58.322
but there's a critical point here

00:04:58.322 --> 00:05:00.274
where as you're moving P, at some point

00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:03.479
it kind of passes over and
turns it into a saddle point.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.630
And again, this is
entirely the coefficient

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.699
in front of the xy term,
it has nothing to do

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.949
with the x squared or the y squared.

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.969
So at some point it kinda passes over

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:15.756
and from that point on everything

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:17.785
is going to be a saddle point.

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.043
And in a moment it'll become clear

00:05:19.043 --> 00:05:20.792
that that critical point happens

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:22.339
when P is equal to two.

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.700
So right here it's gonna
be when P equals two,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.863
it kinda passes from making
things a local minimum

00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:29.694
to a saddle point.

00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.688
And let me show you the
test which will tell us

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:32.869
why this is true.

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:35.839
So the full reasoning behind this test

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:37.754
is something that I'll
get to in later videos,

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.477
but right now I just want to,
kind of have it on the table

00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:42.955
and teach you what it
is and how to use it.

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:46.699
So this is called the second
partial derivative test.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.848
Second partial derivative
test, I'll just write

00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:53.765
deriv test since I'm a slow writer.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.345
And basically what it says is if you found

00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:58.421
a point where the
gradient of your function

00:05:58.421 --> 00:06:00.253
at this point, and I'll write it kind of

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:03.711
x not, y not is our point, if
you found where it equals zero

00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:06.803
then calculate the following value.

00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:08.268
You'll take the second partial derivative

00:06:08.268 --> 00:06:10.262
with respect to x twice,
so here I'm just using

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.701
that subscript notation
which is completely

00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:14.934
the same as saying, you know,
second partial derivative

00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:16.887
with respect to x twice, just different

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.681
choice in notation, and you evaluate it

00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:22.848
at this point, x not, y
not, then you multiply that

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.249
by the second partial
derivative with respect to y

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:30.075
evaluated at that same point, y not,

00:06:30.075 --> 00:06:33.046
and then you subtract off
the mixed partial derivative,

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:34.873
the one where first you
do it with respect to x

00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:36.743
then with respect to y,
or in the other order,

00:06:36.743 --> 00:06:38.373
it doesn't really matter as long as you

00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:40.365
take it with respect
to both the variables.

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:42.924
You subtract off that guy squared.

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:45.567
So what you do is you
compute this entire value

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:47.317
and it's gonna give you
some kind of number,

00:06:47.317 --> 00:06:49.512
and let's give it a name, let's name it H,

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:54.270
and if it's the case that
H is greater than zero

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.682
then you have either a max or a min,

00:06:57.682 --> 00:06:59.143
you're not sure which one yet

00:06:59.143 --> 00:07:01.095
and it's a max or a min.

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.474
And you can tell whether it's a maximum

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:04.304
or a minimum basically by
looking at one of these

00:07:04.304 --> 00:07:06.662
partial derivative with respect to x twice

00:07:06.662 --> 00:07:08.979
or with respect to y twice and kind of

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:11.014
getting a feel for the
concavity there, right.

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:12.720
If this was positive it would indicate

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.592
kind of a smiley face concavity

00:07:14.592 --> 00:07:16.300
and it would be a local minimum.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.966
And the fact that this entire value H

00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:20.040
is greater than zero is what you need

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.466
to tell you that you can just do that,

00:07:21.466 --> 00:07:23.700
you can look at the concavity with respect

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.690
to one of those guys and that'll tell you

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.579
the information you need
about the entire graph.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:32.153
But if H is less than zero,
if H is less than zero,

00:07:32.153 --> 00:07:36.054
then you definitely have a saddle point.

00:07:36.054 --> 00:07:37.137
Saddle point.

00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.066
And if H is purely equal to zero,

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:46.386
if you get that unlucky
case, then you don't know,

00:07:46.386 --> 00:07:47.848
then the second partial derivative test

00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:49.436
isn't enough to determine.

00:07:49.436 --> 00:07:51.062
But almost all cases
you'll find that either

00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:54.186
it's purely greater than zero
or purely less than zero.

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:56.345
So as an example let's
see what that looks like

00:07:56.345 --> 00:07:59.107
in the case of the specific
function we started with.

00:07:59.107 --> 00:08:00.613
Where P is some constant
that I was letting

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:02.200
kind of, range from zero to four

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.433
when I was animating it
here, but you should just

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:06.709
think of P as being some number.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:08.990
Well in that case, this value H

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.426
that we plug in, and let's
say we're plugging it in

00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:13.869
at the origin, right, we're
analyzing at the origin.

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:16.063
Well we've already calculated
the partial derivative

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:19.399
with respect to x twice in
a row and y twice in a row

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.633
and both of those, when we computed those

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:24.034
were just constants two, they
were equal to two everywhere

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:27.205
and in particular they're
equal to two at the origin.

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.154
So we can go ahead and just plug in those

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:32.649
and we see that this is two times two

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.723
and then now we need to subtract off

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.444
the mixed partial derivative squared.

00:08:37.444 --> 00:08:39.359
So if we go ahead and compute that

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:41.631
where we take the derivative
with respect to x and then and

00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.028
or y and then x, let's
say we started with the

00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:46.752
partial derivative with respect to x.

00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:49.953
When we take this
derivative with respect to y

00:08:49.953 --> 00:08:51.623
we're gonna get this constant term

00:08:51.623 --> 00:08:53.045
that's sitting in front of the y.

00:08:53.045 --> 00:08:56.297
But really it's whatever this
constant P happened to equal.

00:08:56.297 --> 00:08:57.889
And you might be able
to see that just looking

00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:59.191
at this function, that when you take

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:00.898
the mixed partial derivative it's gonna be

00:09:00.898 --> 00:09:02.810
the coefficient in front of the xy term,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.840
'cause it's kind of like, first you do

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.785
the derivative with respect
to x and the x goes away

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:09.385
and then with respect to
y and that y goes away

00:09:09.385 --> 00:09:11.864
and you're just left with a constant.

00:09:11.864 --> 00:09:12.880
So what you end up getting here

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.795
in the second partial derivative test,

00:09:14.795 --> 00:09:17.110
when we take that value which is P,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.302
which might equal four or zero or whatever

00:09:19.302 --> 00:09:22.420
we happen to have it
as and we square that,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.871
we square that, that's gonna be the value

00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:26.253
that we analyze.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:29.343
So in the case where P
was equal to zero, right,

00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:31.454
if we go over here and we scale so that P

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:34.304
is completely equal to zero,
then our entire value H,

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:38.696
H would equal four, and
because H is positive

00:09:38.696 --> 00:09:40.773
it's definitely a maximum or a minimum

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.440
and then by analyzing one of those

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.407
second partial derivatives
with respect to x or y

00:09:45.407 --> 00:09:47.481
and seeing that it's positive concavity,

00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.042
we would see, oh, it's
definitely a local minimum

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:52.603
'cause positive concavity
gives local minimum.

00:09:52.603 --> 00:09:54.068
But in the other case where, let's say

00:09:54.068 --> 00:09:58.170
we let P range such that P
is all the way equal to four,

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.655
in formulas what that means for us

00:10:00.655 --> 00:10:03.748
when we let P equal four is we're taking

00:10:03.748 --> 00:10:06.151
two times two, minus four squared.

00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:08.843
We're taking two times two, minus 16.

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:11.198
What that would imply,
sorry about getting kinda

00:10:11.198 --> 00:10:15.022
scrunched on the board
here, is that H is equal to,

00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:18.524
let's see four minus 16, negative 12.

00:10:18.524 --> 00:10:22.228
I'm just gonna erase this to
kind of, clear up some room.

00:10:22.228 --> 00:10:25.030
So when P equals four,
this is negative 12.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.038
And in fact, this kind of
explains the crossover point

00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:30.237
for when it goes from being local minimum

00:10:30.237 --> 00:10:32.066
to a saddle point.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:34.463
It's gonna be at that point where

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:36.864
this entire expression is equal to zero.

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:39.873
And you can see that
happens when P equals two.

00:10:39.873 --> 00:10:41.783
So over here the crossover point

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:42.963
when it kind of goes from being

00:10:42.963 --> 00:10:46.059
a local minimum to a saddle
point is at P equals two.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:48.861
And when P perfectly
equals two, let's see,

00:10:48.861 --> 00:10:52.848
so about here, the second
partial derivative test

00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:54.967
isn't gonna be enough to tell us anything.

00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:56.714
It can't tell us it's definitely a max

00:10:56.714 --> 00:10:59.723
and it can't tell us that
it's definitely a saddle point

00:10:59.723 --> 00:11:01.753
and in this particular
case that that corresponds

00:11:01.753 --> 00:11:04.275
to the fact that the
graph is perfectly flat

00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:06.998
in one direction and a
minimum in another direction.

00:11:06.998 --> 00:11:08.510
In other cases it might
mean something different

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.813
and I'll probably make a video

00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:11.769
just about that special case when

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:14.049
this whole value is equal to zero.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.515
But for now all that I want to emphasize

00:11:15.515 --> 00:11:18.647
is what this test is
where you take all three

00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.561
second partial derivatives and you kind of

00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:21.870
multiply together the two pure

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.863
second partial derivatives where you do

00:11:23.863 --> 00:11:26.628
x and then x, and then one
where you do y and then y,

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:28.211
you multiply those together and then

00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:32.155
you subtract off that mixed
partial derivative squared.

00:11:32.155 --> 00:11:33.581
And in the next video I'll try to give

00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:35.128
a little bit more intuition for,

00:11:35.128 --> 00:11:36.792
you know, where this
whole formula comes from,

00:11:36.792 --> 00:11:38.053
why it's not completely random,

00:11:38.053 --> 00:11:39.800
why taking this and analyzing

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.262
whether it's greater than zero

00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:44.273
or less than zero is a
reasonable thing to do

00:11:44.273 --> 00:11:46.875
for analyzing whether a
point that you're looking at

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:50.338
is a local minimum or a local
maximum or a saddle point.

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:51.421
See you then.
