00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.450
Convert log base
4 of 2 equals 1/2

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.050
into an exponential equation.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.990
So a logarithm
literally tells you--

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.480
so if we were to just look
at this part right over here,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.010
a logarithm is just saying,
tell me the exponent

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.620
that I would have
to raise my base to,

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.040
that I would have to
raise 4 to, to get to 2.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.990
So tell me the
exponent that I would

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.190
have to raise it to to get to 2.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.460
And so this equation written
as a logarithmic equation says,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.171
I need to raise 4 to the
1/2 power in order to get 2.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.420
So if I wanted to write it
as an exponential equation,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.530
I could literally just
say, well, if I raise 4--

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.150
and that's this 4
right over here.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.740
That's my base-- to this
exponent, to the 1/2 power,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.830
then that is going
to be equal to 2.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.520
And we're done.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.110
We've written the same equation
as an exponential equation.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.850
The value of a logarithm--
this is saying,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.320
what do I get if I raise
4 to the 1/2 power?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.390
I get 2 if I raise
4 to the 1/2 power.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.210
This is saying, what power do I
have to raise 4 to to get to 2?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.800
And then that is equal to 1/2.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.960
So a logarithm is
saying, what power

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.530
do I have to raise
the base to to get

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.210
what's inside the logarithm?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.738
This says, what do I get to
when I raise 4 to the 1/2 power?
