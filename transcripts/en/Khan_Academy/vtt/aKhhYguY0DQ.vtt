00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.380
Well, after the last video,
hopefully, we're a little

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.330
familiar with how you
add matrices.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.150
So now let's learn how
to multiply matrices.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.450
And keep in mind, these are
human-created definitions for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.840
matrix multiplication.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.000
We could have come up with
completely different ways to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.450
multiply it.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.510
But I encourage you to learn
this way because it'll help

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.810
you in math class.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.100
And we will see later that
there's actually a lot of

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.730
applications that come out
of this type of matrix

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.290
multiplication.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.340
So let me think of
two matrices.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.320
I will do two 2 by 2 matrices,
and let's multiply them.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.500
Let's say-- let me pick some
random numbers: 2,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.530
minus 3, 7, and 5.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.980
And I'm going to multiply that
matrix, or that table of

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:56.440
numbers, times 10, minus 8--
let me pick a good number

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.980
here-- 12, and then minus 2.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.400
So now there might be a strong
temptation-- and you know in

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
some ways it's not even an
illegitimate temptation-- to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.880
do the same thing with
multiplication that we did

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.520
with addition, to just multiply
the corresponding

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.580
terms. So you might be tempted
to say, well, the first term

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.160
right here, the 1, 1 term, or
in the first row and first

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.070
column, is going to
be 2 times 10.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.970
And this term is going
to be minus 3 times

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.230
minus 8 and so forth.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.330
And that's how we added matrices
so maybe it's a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.510
natural extension to multiply
matrices the same way.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.180
And that is legitimate.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.530
One could define it that way,
but that's not the way it is

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.410
in the real world.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.380
And the way in the real world,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.470
unfortunately, is more complex.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.980
But if you look at a
bunch of examples I

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:45.670
think you'll get it.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.460
And you'll learn that
it's actually fairly

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.980
straightforward.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.985
So how do we do it?

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:53.290
So this first term that's in
the first row and its first

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.050
column, is equal to essentially
this first row's

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.380
vector-- no, this first
row vector--

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.790
times this column vector.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.229
Now what do I mean
by that, right?

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.320
So it's getting it's row
information from the first

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.170
matrix's row, and it's getting
it's column information from

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.320
the second matrix's column.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.190
So how do I do that?

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.860
If you're familiar with dot
product, it's essentially the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.930
dot product of these
two matrices.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.820
Or without saying it that fancy,
it's just this: it's 2

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.890
times 10, so 2-- I'm going to
write small-- times 10, plus

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.640
minus 3 times 12.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.630
I'm going to run out of space.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.600
And so what's this second
term over here?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.170
Well, we're still on the first
row of the product vector but

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.350
now we're on the
second column.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.910
We get our column information
from here.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.800
So let's pick a good color--
this is a slightly different

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.530
shade of purple.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.110
So now this is going to be--
I'll do that in another

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.580
color-- 2 times minus 8-- let me
just write out the number--

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.810
2 times minus 8 is minus 16,
plus minus 3 times minus 2--

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.160
what's minus 3 times minus 2?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.400
That is plus 6, right?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.870
So that's in row 1 column 2.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.590
It's minus 16 plus 6.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.830
And then let's come down here.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.920
So now we're in the
second row.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.550
So now we're going to use--
we're getting our row

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.930
information from the first
matrix-- I know this is

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.380
confusing and I feel bad for you
right now, but we're going

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.230
to a bunch of examples and
I think it'll make sense.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.060
So this term-- the bottom left
term-- is going to be this row

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.310
times this column.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:58.010
So it's going to be 7 times
10, so 70, plus 7 times 10

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.650
plus 5 times 12, plus 60.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.290
And then the bottom right term
is going to be 7 times minus

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:19.540
8, which is minus 56 plus
5 times minus 2.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.900
So that's minus 10.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:31.290
So the final product is going to
be 2 times 10 is 20, minus

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:41.040
36, so that's minus 16
plus 6, that's 10.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.220
90-- was that what I said?

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.390
No, it was-- 70, plus
60, that's 130.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:55.580
And then minus 56 minus
10, so minus 66.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.400
So there you have it.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.020
We just multiplied this matrix
times this matrix.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.360
Let me do another example.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.490
And I think I'll actually
squeeze it on this side so

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.106
that we can write this side out
a little bit more neatly.

00:05:06.106 --> 00:05:18.630
So let's take the matrix and
now 1, 2, 3, 4, times the

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:27.710
matrix 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.200
Now we have much more space to
work with so this should come

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.760
out neater.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.460
OK, but I'm going to do the
same thing, so to get this

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.350
term right here-- the top left
term-- we're going to take--

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.070
or the one that has row 1 column
1-- we're going to take

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:52.050
the row 1 information from
here, and the column 1

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.440
information from here.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.070
So you can view it as
this row vector

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.120
times this column vector.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.680
So it results, 1 times
5 plus 2 times 7.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.380
Right?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.610
There you go.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.520
And so this term, it'll be this
row vector times this

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.740
column vector-- let me do that
in a different color-- will be

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.550
1 times 6 plus 2 times 8.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.370
Let me write that down.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:28.590
So it's 1 times 6
plus 2 times 8.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.720
Now we go down to
the second row.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.130
And we get our row information
from the first vector-- let me

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.150
circle it with this color--
and it is 3 times 5

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.520
plus 4 times 7.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.760
And then we are in the bottom
right, so we're in the bottom

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.070
row and second column.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.350
So we get our row information
from here and our column

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.930
information from here.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.860
So it's 3 times 6
plus 4 times 8.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.680
And if we simplify,
this is 5 plus--

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.950
Well actually, let me just
remind you where all the

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:16.630
numbers came from.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.200
So we have that green
color, right?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:25.890
This 1 and this 2, that's
this 1 and this 2,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.620
this 1 and this 2.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.755
Right?

00:07:28.755 --> 00:07:30.330
And notice, these were in the
first row and they're in the

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.660
first row here.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.640
And this 5 and this 7?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.920
Well, that's this 5 and this
7, and this 5 and this 7.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.800
So, interesting.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.410
This was in column 1 of the
second matrix and this is in

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.780
column 1 in the product
matrix.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.030
And similarly, the
6 and the 8.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.610
That's this 6, this 8, and then
it's used here, this 6

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.540
and this 8.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.250
And then finally this 3 and the
4 in the brown, so that's

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.980
this 3, this 4, and
this 3 and this 4.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.290
And we could of course
simplify all of it.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.180
This was 1 times 5 plus 2 times
7, so that's 5 plus 14,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.410
so this is 19.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.200
This is 1 times 6 plus 2
times 8, so it's 6 plus

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.330
16, so that's 22.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.380
This is 3 times 5
plus 4 times 7.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.909
So 15 plus 28, 38, 43-- if my
math is correct-- and then we

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.250
have 3 times 6 plus 4 times 8.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:44.220
So that's 18 plus
32, that's 50.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.980
So now let me ask you-- just so
you know that the product

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.690
matrix-- just write
it neatly-- is

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.610
19, 22, 43, and 50.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.100
So now let me ask
you a question.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.810
When we did matrix addition we
learned that if I had two

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:03.210
matrices-- it didn't matter what
order we added them in.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.970
So if we said, A plus B-- and
these are matrices; that's why

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.340
I'm making them all bold-- we
said this is the same thing as

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.330
B plus A, based on how
we define matrix

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.520
addition, B plus A.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.060
So now let me ask
you a question.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.970
Is multiplying two matrices,
is AB-- that's just means

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.460
we're multiplying A and B-- is
that the same thing as BA?

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.820
Does it matter?

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.800
Does the order of the matrix
multiplication matter?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.310
And so, I'll tell you right
now, it actually matters a

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.090
tremendous amount.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.550
And actually there are certain
matrices that you can add in

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.040
one direction that you can't
add in the other-- oh, that

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:47.300
you can multiply in one way but
you can't multiply in the

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:48.200
other order.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.755
And well, I'll show you that
in an example-- but just to

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:52.800
show that this isn't even equal
for most matrices, I

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.640
encourage you to multiply these
two matrices in the

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.110
other order.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.950
Actually let me do that.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.630
Let me do that really
fast just to prove

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.440
the point to you.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.830
So let me delete all
this top part.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:13.830
Let me delete all of it, and
actually I can delete to this.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.960
So hopefully, you know that when
I multiply this matrix

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.850
times this matrix, I got this.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.250
So let me switch the order--
and I'll do it fairly fast

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.140
just so as to not bore you-- so
let me switch the order of

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.150
the matrix multiplication.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.755
This is good as this is another
example-- so I'm going

00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:36.740
to multiply this matrix: 5, 6,
7, 8, times this matrix-- and

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.400
I just switched the order; and
we're testing to see whether

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.700
order matters-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.010
Let's do it-- and I won't do all
the colors and everything,

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.690
I'll just do it systematically.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.330
I think you just have to see a
lot of examples here-- So this

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.410
first term gets its row
information from the first

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.810
matrix, column information
from the second matrix.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:06.340
So it's 5 times 1 plus 6 times
3, so it's 5 times 1--

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.130
Let me just write,
actually edit.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:17.650
I'm going to skip a step here--
OK so it's 5 times 1

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.480
plus 6 times 3, plus 18.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.110
What's the second term here?

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.650
It's going to be 5 times
2 plus 6 times 4.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:40.190
So 5 times 2 is 10, plus
6 times 4 is 24.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.390
Right, now we just took
this row times this

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.680
column right here.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.030
OK now we're down here for the
set-- so then we're doing this

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.095
row, this element right here at
the bottom left is going to

00:11:51.095 --> 00:11:52.960
use this row, and this column.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:12:00.410
So it's 7 times 1
plus 8 times 3.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.980
8 times 3 is 24.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.430
And then finally, to get this
element we're essentially

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:11.820
multiplying this row times this
column, so it's 7 times 2

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:21.810
is 14, plus 8 times
4, plus 32.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:30.020
So this is equal to 5
plus 18 is 23, 34.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.100
What's 7 plus 24?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.530
That's 31, 46.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:44.140
So notice, if we called
this matrix A and this

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.080
is matrix B, right?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:57.560
In the last example, we showed
that A times B is equal to 19,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.640
22, 43, 50.

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.550
And we just showed that, well,
if you reverse the order, B

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.225
times A is actually this
completely different matrix.

00:13:10.225 --> 00:13:12.230
So the order in which
you multiply

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.140
matrices completely matters.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.330
So I'm actually running
out of time.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.210
In the next video I going talk
a little bit more about the

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.260
types of matrix-- well, one, we
know that order matters--

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.110
and in the next video I'll
show that what type of

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.460
matrices can be multiplied
by each other.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.820
When we added or subtracted
matrices, we just said, well

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.850
they have to have the same
dimensions because you're

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.855
adding or subtracting
corresponding terms. But

00:13:33.855 --> 00:13:37.040
you'll see with multiplication
it's a little bit different.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.253
And we'll do that in
the next video.

00:13:38.253 --> 00:13:39.790
See you soon.
