00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.400
In the video on the Fourth
Coalition, I forgot to add to

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.810
one super important
consequence of

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
the Treaties of Tilsit.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.240
And especially the Treaty
of Tilsit with Prussia.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.560
I already talked about that it
was all about carving up

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.260
Prussia, and humiliating
Prussia.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.440
And really removing it from
the status of one the

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.940
preeminent powers.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.320
And all I talked about was the
loss of the territories of

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.710
Prussia west of the Elbe.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.800
And that's about that
area right there.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.850
But just as important
as that, the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.050
Polish holdings of Prussia.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:45.340
So all of this area right over
here, this also was removed

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.500
from Prussia and became a
French satellite state.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760
It became the Duchy of Warsaw.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.160
So I just really want
to emphasize.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.300
The Treaty of Tilsit, I only
emphasized kind of what

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.240
happened on the western side
of Prussia, but the eastern

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.020
side of Prussia also
got carved up.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.730
And Prussia essentially
lost half of its size.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.150
So it's very dramatic
humiliation for Prussia at the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.250
end of the Treaty of Tilsit.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.740
Or the Treaties of Tilsit.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.780
Now with that out of the way,
we talked about in the last

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.510
video, that at the end of the
Fourth Coalition, Napoleon was

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.740
kind of near the peak
of his power.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.360
He'd kind of done everything
right.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.370
He had this kind of steady
upward momentum, or France had

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.900
a steady upward momentum
in its power.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.200
But what we're going to see in
this video, at least the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.400
beginnings of the downfall
of Napoleon.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.670
And it's not going to
be obvious when

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.570
you look at the territory.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.390
Because from a territorial point
of view, you're going to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.040
see in this video that he's
actually gaining territory.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.430
But he is going to start doing
some of the actions that end

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.190
up undermining him.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.500
So we talked about in the last
video, we talked about this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.950
whole notion of the Continental
System, where

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.800
Napoleon was obsessed with
people on the continent of

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.580
Europe boycotting England,
not trading with England.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.900
And he figured this is the only
way that he could really

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.800
undermine England's dominance
on the ocean.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.480
Or eventually maybe even
undermine England generally.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.390
So as we said, in the Treaties
of Tilsit he got Russia to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.850
participate in the Continental
System.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.100
So he wanted everyone
to buy into it.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.110
And one party that, at this
point, we're talking about--

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.390
we're in 1807 now-- one party
that wasn't all that keen in

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.240
participating in the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.420
Continental System was Portugal.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.600
That's Portugal right there.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.050
So Napoleon goes and chats--
well they didn't chat

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.280
directly-- but he gets
the agreement

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.590
of the King of Spain.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.790
This is Charles IV, and he's
going to look like a bit of a

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.040
fool and this video.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.320
And Napoleon says, hey Charles,
let's go in there,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.740
let's go into Portugal, that
little upstart country that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.980
doesn't want to participate
in the Continental System.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.970
You and me, we'll
invade together.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.870
We'll bring them into kind of
our realm of influence.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.960
And we can both kind of pillage
the lands and get the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.910
wealth of Portugal.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.840
Charles IV, he's all
up for this.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.870
So a combined French and Spanish
force invade Portugal.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.690
So in 1807, this is
the end of 1807,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.700
it's actually in October.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:33.980
In October, you have a combined
French and Spanish

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.060
invasion of Portugal.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.570
And they are able to take
Portugal, but we're going to

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.570
see that it's reasonably
temporary.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.290
Now I just mentioned that this
guy is going to look like the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.760
fool of this video.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.400
And the reason is, because
with the excuse of

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.100
reinforcements, obviously to get
to Portugal, you have to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.820
go through Spain.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.700
So with the excuse of sending in
reinforcements, Napoleon in

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.410
1808-- and now we're talking
about early 1808, in

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.480
particular in March.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.980
So with the excuse of sending
in reinforcements to support

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610
the Portugal campaign, and Spain
is like your my ally,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.440
sure, send those hundreds of
thousands of troops right

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.250
through our territory.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.220
We're not going to
worry about it.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.250
And with that excuse, Napoleon
was able to send 100,000

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.950
troops and occupy Madrid.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.570
So this is one of
those lessons of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.490
never get too greedy.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.620
This guy got greedy, wanted
to help Napoleon.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.710
Or I guess the other lesson
is be careful who

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.960
your friends are.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.020
This guy wanted to invade
Portugal, but the side effect

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.960
of it is that Madrid
gets occupied.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.080
And that actually he
gets dethrowned.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.650
And so you have this situation
here, the French are now in

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.010
control of Spain.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:59.440
In May of 1808-- and this is
really going to be the first

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.010
little spark that is kind of
the downfall of Napoleon.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:12.510
In May 2, 1808, a popular
uprising starts in Madrid.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.990
Dos de Mayo.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.136
So a popular uprising
in Madrid.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.860
And at the same time, a little
bit after that--

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.350
So you can imagine, this is
a hugely tumultuous time.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.030
You have this occupation of
Portugal with the excuse of

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.640
reinforcements in March.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.725
The French troops
occupy Madrid.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.860
Then in May-- so a couple of
months later-- a popular

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.600
uprising starts in Madrid.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.880
This leads to popular uprisings
throughout Spain.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.490
But at the very same time as
this-- this is a little bit

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.890
after the uprising in May--
Napoleon says, oh, this is

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.250
just a little uprising, I'm
still in control of Spain.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.630
He appoints his other brother--
remember, there's

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.650
this whole business he's putting
his brothers in charge

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.860
of different parts
of the Empire.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.290
He puts his brother Joseph, he
appoints his brother Joseph--

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.890
or you could kind of say-- he
inserts his brother Joseph as

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.140
the King of Spain.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.410
So this is all in kind
of early, mid-1808.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.110
Spain is in all of
this turmoil.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.710
A new king has been appointed,
who is Napoleon's brother.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.350
The old king is no
longer in charge.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.060
You have this ongoing
battle in Portugal.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.960
They don't have a firm hold
on Portugal just yet.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.680
And in the rest of 1808, the
uprising that occurs

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.770
throughout Spain is actually
pretty successful in enforcing

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.810
the French troops to retreat.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.770
And a major, I guess, aspect of
this uprising is it's one

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.780
of the first real national
uprisings in history.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.000
It's people saying we are
Spanish, we do not like being

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.940
controlled by the French.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.240
We do not like how they have
treated our royalty.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.870
We as a nation are
going to rise up.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.040
And the other interesting aspect
of this whole uprising

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.770
that starts in Madrid with Dos
de Mayo, but then it starts

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.120
continuing throughout the whole
nation, is the idea of

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.370
guerrilla warfare.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.730
Not gorilla warfare.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.360
And this comes from the Spanish
for little war.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.220
Not from the large ape.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.280
And what it implies, you
probably heard the word on the

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.330
news before, is kind of a
non-conventional style of

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.800
fighting, where small little
groups kind of engage their

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.740
enemy in very nontraditional
styles.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.200
So it becomes a very painful--
at least for it Napoleon's

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.800
forces-- it became very
difficult fighting these

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.360
non-conventional battles
all over Spain.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.930
So they were able to force
the French to retreat.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.530
Napoleon says, gee,
you know what?

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.630
If you want a job well done,
you've got to do it yourself.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.910
So Napoleon comes in at the end
of the year, and then he

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.530
retakes Madrid.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:39.340
So December of 1808, Napoleon
back in Madrid.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.670
Now, you might say all
is fine and well.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.220
Now Napoleon is back here.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.470
He has firm control of Spain.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.130
But not everything is good.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.170
Because as you could imagine,
there's all these other

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.050
characters here that keep
forming coalitions for and

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.460
against Napoleon.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.300
Even when they say that they're
allied, you know that

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.630
in the back of their minds they
can't wait until they can

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.770
declare the next war
on Napoleon.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:19.990
So in 1809-- let me write this
down-- Austria declares war.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:28.410
And since Great Britain was in--
at this point in time--

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.790
perpetual war with France, this

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.076
becomes the Fifth Coalition.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.920
But this one is fairly
short-lived.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.980
Napoleon says gee, I got these
guys on my eastern front.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.980
Austria is re-declaring
war on me.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.330
So he leaves Spain to
go lead that fight.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.210
And he leaves 300,000 of
his best troops in

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.860
Spain to hold Spain.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.690
And frankly, this is the most
important side effect of the

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.750
Fifth Coalition, is that it
makes Napoleon go to fight

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.150
Austria, to lead that effort,
as opposed to

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.680
worrying about Spain.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.790
And essentially by doing that--
and I don't know if

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.300
it's necessarily the fact that
Napoleon wasn't there.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.250
But it could be because Napoleon
wasn't there-- is

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.510
that Spain just becomes
a major thorn

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.390
in Napoleon's side.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.480
This guerrilla warfare just
continues on and on and on.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.990
And it just goes
back and forth.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.550
And the French will
win a battle and

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.360
they'll win another battle.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.470
But they still don't
have control.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.240
And these guerrillas will kind
of peck at them and continue

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.680
the uprising.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.190
And this really just drains
the French army.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.060
And really just gets at them
little bit by little bit,

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.340
really over the remainder
of Napoleon's reign.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.540
So all the way until 1814.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.800
We haven't gone over that yet.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.870
But this occurs all
the way to 1814.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.140
So I said at the beginning the
video, this is one of the

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.950
starting points of Napoleon's
downfall.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.490
That's just because he was just
stuck in Spain from 1808

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.260
on, just continuing to have to
send troops and supplies and

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.730
reinforcements and wealth to
support what they called the

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.980
Peninsular Campaign.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.420
And it just drains him.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.710
It drains his resources,
it drains his energy.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.200
And it really hurts his ability
to fight wars with all

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.800
of the other people who he
needs to fight wars with.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.660
This is one of the
major downfalls.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.720
The other one, which we'll
probably talk about in the

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.830
next video or video
after that, is

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.060
his invasion of Russia.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.140
Which he does in 1812.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.340
One could debate which
one drains

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.280
France's resources more.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.950
But the invasion of
Russia really

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.040
decimates Napoleon's forces.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.950
And really makes him susceptible
to really conquest

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.160
by England and all of
the other allies.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.590
And we're going to see that
in a couple of videos.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.810
So you have this been Peninsular
Campaign continuing

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.920
to drain Napoleon.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.880
It all started because he
wanted to enforce the

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.570
Continental System
on Portugal.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:04.580
And he got a little
bit greedy.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.480
And he also wanted
to conquer Spain.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480
And just to highlight
why it's called

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.490
the Peninsular Campaign.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.050
This right here, a little bit
of geography, this is called

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.120
the Iberian Peninsula right
there that I'm circling.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.580
So you could call it the Iberian
Peninsular Campaign,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.895
because it's everything that's
going on in this Peninsula in

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.145
Spain and Portugal.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.290
Now if we back up a little bit
back to 1808, where we had

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:39.380
this uprising in Spain, and
they were able to push the

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.380
French back.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.320
At the same time, you also had a
popular uprising in Portugal

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.330
roughly in the fall, late
summer or fall of 1808.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:50.440
The British got excited.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.570
They saw it as their chance to
push Napoleon out of Portugal.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.880
So you have this
gentleman right

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.830
here, Sir Arthur Wellesley.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.600
He's a future Duke
of Wellington.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.590
And he's eventually going to
be responsible for pushing

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.720
Napoleon out of Spain
entirely.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.970
Or at least out of Madrid.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.670
Him and along with the British
and along with the Portuguese

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.240
are able to push the French
out in August of 1808.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.510
So let me put this in my not so
neatly drawn timeline here.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.280
So in December, Napoleon is
back, so right before that in

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.836
August, out of Portugal.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.900
And this is another motivation
for Napoleon to say,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.570
gee, you know what?

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.340
Things aren't going well on the
Iberian Peninsula, I have

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.810
to take charge of
things myself.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.000
Now, at the very same time as
all of this is happening, and

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.200
this is really just kind of
out of interest. Well it's

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.510
more than out of interest,
because actually it has huge

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.460
global repercussions.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.680
You might say, OK, well you have
this Iberian Peninsula.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.510
Spain is going back and
forth between the

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.690
French and the guerillas.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.590
And Portugal has this whole
situation where their king was

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.180
dethrowned, but then the British
help and take it back.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.720
But you could imagine, these
nations are in just a super

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.970
state of flux.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.440
Now you could also imagine, the
King of Spain wasn't just

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.640
the King of Spain, he was King
of the Spanish Empire.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.670
And the Spanish Empire, the main
land mass of the Spanish

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.180
Empire was in the Americas.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.170
So this right here.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.830
That was the Spanish
Empire at the time.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.900
This was a 400 year old
Spanish Empire.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.970
Starting with Columbus sailing
the ocean blue in 1492.

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.490
You had this huge
Spanish Empire.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.680
And one of the really important
side effects of

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.180
Napoleon invading Spain and
having this long protracted

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.380
engagement in Spain, is it
catalyzed the ability of these

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.040
colonies at the time to start
looking for their

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.500
independence.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.260
And we're going to do whole
videos on that in the future.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.890
But this really is one of the
things that allowed them to

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.350
get independence.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.860
Obviously, if the empire is in
flux, these guys can say hey,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:14.860
gee, why do we have to listen
to that nation anymore?

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.950
We don't even know who's
in charge there.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.580
At the same time, same
thing in Portugal.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.540
Brazilian independence didn't
come until a little bit later

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.860
after this period, but
Napoleon's invasion is what

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.320
really sparked the beginning
of a lot

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.500
of turmoil in Portugal.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.300
And that eventually is one of
the causes that leads to the

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.510
eventual independence
of Brazil.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.790
That doesn't happen for another
10 or 15 years.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.240
But you could imagine, this is
where a lot of that action can

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.550
be traced back.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.510
Now, another interesting
point that

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.900
occurred around this time.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.580
And actually, I didn't tell
you what happened

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.710
on the Fifth Coalition.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.500
I said Austria declared war.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.730
Obviously Britain was
already at war.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.130
So it was the Fifth Coalition.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.200
Napoleon had to leave, that
maybe made Spain a little bit

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.860
harder to hold for France.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.550
And that's why it kind of
bled France slowly.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.580
But Napoleon was able to
take care of Austria.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.930
And then he was able to
take a little bit

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.140
more land from them.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.890
Actually Galicia, this area of
Austria was given to the Duchy

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.880
of Warsaw, which was a French
satellite state.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.330
And then Austria once again, had
to say oh Napoleon, we're

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.460
your friend, we're going to
do whatever you ask us to.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.020
So you can imagine at this time
landwise, the empire of

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.530
Napoleon seemed pretty
dramatic.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.480
You could include Spain here.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.500
Although he had to spend a lot
of resources to keep Spain.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.510
And then now we had Austria, at
least it was in the fold.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.770
You know Prussia was not
really happy about it.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:44.230
But this whole area here, the
western half of Poland was

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.300
under French control.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.310
Germany-- the Confederacy
of the Rhine--

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.600
which is now Germany.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.070
And then a good bit of Italy,
the Kingdom of Italy was also

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.900
a French satellite state.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.950
But Napoleon, of course, he
wanted everyone to participate

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.870
in the Continental System.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.440
That's the only way to really
strangle England.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.940
And the Papal States were
not participating in the

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.190
Continental System.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.270
So he sent some people over
to kind of try to

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.339
convince them to.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.470
And when they didn't, they
occupied the Papal States.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.630
So French troops occupied
the Papal States.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.920
And then once again, this
was still back in 1808.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.620
This is actually early
1808, it's just

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.120
on a different front.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.040
So in February, up
here, in 1808.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.460
Actually, that's before they
even occupied Madrid.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:42.070
So in 1808, February, French
troops occupy Papal States.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.300
They essentially give them over
to the Kingdom of Italy,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.180
which at that time was a
French satellite state.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.090
So it's almost like annexing
it to France.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.020
And then once the Fifth
Coalition was done with,

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.880
Napoleon felt so good about
himself, that he formally

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.530
annexed the Papal States.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:06.900
Now we're in 1809.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:19.030
In 1809, he formally-- The
Papal States are actually

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.940
annexed into the
French Empire.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.410
Now you can imagine that
the Pope wasn't

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.530
that happy about this.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.660
This is the Pope at the time,
this is Pius VII.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.590
He wasn't so happy about it.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.660
So he excommunicates Napoleon.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.230
And I'll do a whole video
on excommunication.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.210
But it's really about as bad as
something you could do to

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.990
someone within the powers
of the Catholic Church.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.700
And by implication, you're no
longer part of the church, and

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.430
you'll probably go to hell now,
at least if the Pope has

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:55.610
anything to do with it.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.560
So Napoleon wasn't
happy about this.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.110
He sent some people, some
officers, once again to talk

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.180
to the Pope about it.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.410
To say hey, gee, why
do you want to

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.700
excommunicate Napoleon?

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.920
Why don't you just play nice?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.470
Why don't you just agree to
whatever Napoleon says?

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.060
The Pope doesn't agree, and
so he gets abducted.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.310
This is why it's interesting.

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:18.710
Napoleon, he's not afraid to
take some serious action.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.370
So he gets abducted in 1809
by French officers.

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:37.120
And it's not clear, it's not
obvious that Napoleon told

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.930
them to do it.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.990
But once he was abducted, and
they actually started

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.430
shuttling him all around France
depending on who needed

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:44.200
to talk to him.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.800
Or if they were afraid that the
British might try to free

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.560
him from one port, they would
send them some place else.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.810
But it wasn't clear that
Napoleon ordered this.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.020
But he never ordered
his release.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.180
So in some ways, you got
to say that it was

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.240
sanctioned by Napoleon.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.790
So all of this mess starts, you
know, Napoleon is messing

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:02.520
with the Pope.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.730
He has this ongoing bleeding
going on in Spain.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.620
And that ends actually in 1812
where Sir Arthur Wellesley

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.240
finally retakes Madrid.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.590
But during this whole period,
you can imagine it's really
