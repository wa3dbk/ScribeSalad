00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.130
So far, when I've told you about
the dot and the cross

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.440
products, I've given you the
definition as the magnitude

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.710
times either the cosine
or the sine of the

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.710
angle between them.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.430
But what if you're not given
the vectors visually?

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.210
And what if you're not given
the angle between them?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.240
How do you calculate the dot
and the cross products?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.160
Well, let me give you
the definition that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.000
I giving you already.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.710
So let's say I have a
dot b dot product.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.610
That's the magnitude of a times
the magnitude of b times

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.200
cosine of the angle
between them.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.730
a cross b is equal to the
magnitude of a times the

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.670
magnitude of b times sine of
the angle between them-- so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.360
the perpendicular projections
of them-- times the normal

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.130
vector that's perpendicular
to both of them.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.750
The normal unit vector, and you
figure out which of the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.500
two perpendicular vectors
it is by using

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.620
the right hand rule.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.170
But what if we don't have
the thetas; the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.320
angles between them?

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.760
What if, for example, I were
to tell you that the vector

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.990
a,-- if I were to give it to you
in engineering notation.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.090
In engineering notation,
you're essentially just

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.270
breaking down the vector into
its x, y and z components.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.580
So let's say vector a is 5i--
i is just the unit vector in

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.890
the x direction, minus
6j, plus 3k.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.790
i,j and k are just the unit
vectors of the x, y and z

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.310
directions.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700
And the 5 is how much it goes
in the x direction.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.400
The minus 6 is how much it
goes in the y direction.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.890
And the 3 is how much it goes
in the z direction.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.040
You could try to graph it.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.960
And actually, I'm trying to look
for a graphing calculator

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.370
that'll do this, so I can show
you it all in videos to give

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.360
you more intuition.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.830
But lets say this is
all you're given.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.100
And let's say that b-- I'm just
making these numbers up--

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.170
let's say it's minus 2i-- and,
of course, we're working in

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:14.480
three dimensions right now--
plus 7j, plus 4k.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.300
You could graph it.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.030
But obviously, if you were given
a problem, and if you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.270
were actually trying to model
vectors on a computer

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.510
simulation, this is the
way you would do it.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.690
You'd break it up into the x, y,
and z components because of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.780
the add vectors.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.600
You just have to add the
respective components.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.210
But how do you multiply them
either taking the cross or the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.340
dot product?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580
Well it actually turns out I'm
not going to prove it here but

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.400
I'll just show you
how to do it.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.100
The dot product is very
easy when you have it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.330
given in this notation.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.880
And actually another way of
writing this notation,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.360
sometimes it's in bracket
notation.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.955
Sometimes they would rewrite
this as 5 minus 6, 3.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:49.455
Or it's just the magnitudes of
the x,y and z direction.

00:02:49.455 --> 00:02:53.170
I just want to make sure you're
comfortable with all of

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.270
these various notations.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.360
You could have written b
as minus is 2, 7, 4.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.380
These are all the same things.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.360
You shouldn't get daunted if
you see one or the other.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.430
But anyway, so how do
I take a dot b?

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.670
This, I think you'll find
fairly pleasant.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.410
All you do is you multiply the
i components, add that to the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.270
j components multiplied, and
then add that to the k

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.210
components multiplied
together.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:34.350
So it would be 5 times minus 2
plus minus 6 times 7 plus 3

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:45.260
times 4, so it equals minus
10 minus 42 plus 12.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.020
So this is minus 52 plus 12,
so it equals minus 40.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.460
That's it.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.840
It's just a number.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.090
And I'd actually be curious
to graph this on a three

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.980
dimensional grapher to see
why it's minus 40.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.600
They must be going in
opposite directions.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.680
And their projections onto each
other go into opposite

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.070
directions.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.770
And that's why we get
a minus number.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.030
The purpose of this-- I don't
want to get too much into the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.050
intuition-- this is just how to
calculate, but it's fairly

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.900
straightforward.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.930
You just multiply the
x components.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.029
Add that to the y components
multiplied and add that to the

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.450
z components multiplied.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.710
So whenever I am given something
in engineering or

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.470
bracket notation and I have to
find the dot product, it's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.680
very, almost soothing, and
not so error prone.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.390
But, as you will see, taking the
cross product of these two

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.160
vectors when given in this
notation isn't so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.490
straightforward.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.020
And I want you to keep in mind,
another way you could

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.590
have done it, you could have
figured out the magnitude of

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.470
each of these vectors and then
you could have used some fancy

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.770
trigonometry to figure out the
thetas and then used this

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.370
definition.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.230
But I think you appreciate the
fact that this is a much

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.350
simpler way of doing it.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.140
So the dot product
is a lot of fun.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.570
Now let's see if we could
take the cross product.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.450
And once again, I'm not
going to prove it.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.230
I'm just going to show
you how to do it.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.370
In a future video, I'm sure I'll
get a request to do it

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.710
eventually, and I'll prove it.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.270
But the cross product, this
is more involved.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.210
And I never look forward to
taking the cross product of

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.290
two vectors in engineering
notation.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.700
a cross b.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.760
It equals.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.530
So this is an application
of matrices.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.850
So what you do is you take the
determinant-- I'll draw a big

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.120
determinant line-- on the top
line of the determinant.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.190
This is really just
a way to make you

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.090
memorize how to do it.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.240
It doesn't give you much
intuition, but the intuition

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.690
is given by the actual
definition.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.010
How much of the vectors are
perpendicular to each other.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.050
Multiply those magnitudes.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.210
Right hand rule figures
out what direction

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.360
you're pointing in.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.380
But the way to do it if you're
given engineering notation,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.763
you write the i, j, k unit
vectors the top row.

00:05:55.763 --> 00:06:00.080
i, j, k.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.230
Then you write the first vector
in the cross product,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.560
because order matters.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.550
So it's 5 minus 6, 3.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.320
Then you take the second vector
which is b, which is

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.970
minus 2, 7, 4.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.880
So you take the determinant
of the 3 by 3 matrix,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.350
and how do I do that?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.930
Well that's equal to the
subdeterminant for i.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.460
So the subdeterminant for i, if
you get rid of this column

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.920
and this row, the determinant
that's left over, so that's

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:40.760
minus 6, 3, 7, 4 times i--
you might want to review

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.430
determinants if you don't
remember how to do this, but

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.770
maybe me working through it
will just jog your memory.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.590
And then remember, it's
plus, minus, plus.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.550
So then minus the subdeterminant
for j.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.500
What's the subdeterminant
for j?

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.470
You cross out j's
row and columns.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.065
You have 5, 3, minus 2, 4.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.650
We just crossed j's
row and column.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.770
And whatever's left over, those
are the numbers in its

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.470
subdeterminant.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.420
That's what I call it.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.136
j plus-- I want to do them all
on one line because it would

00:07:18.136 --> 00:07:19.870
have been a little bit
neater-- plus the

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:20.840
subdeterminant for k.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.290
Cross out the row and
the column for k.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:35.010
We're left with 5 minus 6,
minus 2 and 7 times k.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.980
And now let's calculate them.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.440
And let me make some
space, because I've

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.130
written this too big.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.790
I don't think we need
this anymore.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.460
So what do we get?

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.400
Let's take this up here.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.090
So these 2 by 2 determinants
are pretty easy.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:58.690
This is minus 6 times
4 minus 7 times 3.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.180
I always make careless
mistakes here.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:10.770
Minus 24 minus 21 times i minus
5 times 4 is 20, minus

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:23.270
minus 2 times 3, so minus minus
6 j, plus 5 times 7, 35

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.640
minus minus 2 times minus 6.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.330
So it's minus positive 12k.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.330
We could simplify this, which
equals minus 24 minus 21.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:40.830
It is minus 35-- I didn't have
to put a parentheses-- i, and

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.720
then what's 20 minus minus 6?

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.600
Well that's 20 plus
plus 6, so 26.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.590
And then we have a
minus out here.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.640
So minus 26j.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.340
And that was 35 minus
12, that's 23.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.190
Plus 23k.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.690
So that's the cross product.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.150
And if you were to graph this in
three dimensions, you will

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.710
see-- and this is what's
interesting-- you will see

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:09.410
that vector, if my math is
correct, minus 35i, minus 26j,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:15.750
plus 23k, is perpendicular
to both of these vectors.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.440
I think I'll leave you there for
now, and I will see you in

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.050
the next video.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.140
And hopefully, I can track down
a vector graphic program.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.880
Because I think it'll be fun to
both calculate the dot and

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.130
the cross products using the
methods I just showed you and

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.840
then to graph them.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.320
And to show that it
really does work.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.930
That this vector really is
perpendicular to both of these

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.820
and pointing in the direction as
you would predict using the

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.520
right hand rule.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.990
I'll see you in the next video.
