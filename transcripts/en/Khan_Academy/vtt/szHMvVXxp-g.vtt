00:00:00.398 --> 00:00:03.789
- [Voiceover] ♫ Line things
up a little bit right here. ♫

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:04.622
All right.

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:07.953
So in the last video I
set up the scaffolding

00:00:07.953 --> 00:00:09.825
for the quadratic approximation which

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.263
I'm calling Q of a function,

00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:15.119
an arbitrary two variable
function which I'm calling f,

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.252
and the form that we have right now

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:18.496
looks like quite a lot actually.

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.029
We have six different terms.

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.283
Now the first three were
just basically stolen

00:00:22.283 --> 00:00:24.606
from the local linearization formula

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.212
and written in their full abstractness.

00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:27.791
It almost makes it seem a little bit more

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.393
complicated than it is.

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:31.065
And then these next three terms

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.946
are basically the quadratic parts.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.512
We have what is basically X squared.

00:00:35.512 --> 00:00:37.859
We take it as X minus X naught squared

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.757
so that we don't mess
with anything previously

00:00:39.757 --> 00:00:42.357
once we plug in X equals X naught,

00:00:42.357 --> 00:00:44.446
but basically we think
of this as X squared.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:46.537
And then this here is basically X times Y,

00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:48.650
but of course we're
matching each one of them

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.181
with the corresponding X naught Y naught,

00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.969
and then this term is the Y squared.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.625
And the question at hand is

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:55.888
how do we fill in these constants?

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.955
The coefficients in front of each one

00:00:57.955 --> 00:00:59.873
of these quadratic terms to make it

00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:02.821
so that this guy Q hugs the graph of f

00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.191
as closely as possible.

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:05.546
And I showed that in the very first video,

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.828
kind of what that hugging means.

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:09.755
Now in formulas, the goal here,

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:10.847
I should probably state,

00:01:10.847 --> 00:01:13.307
what it is that we want is for the second

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.700
partial derivatives of Q,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.696
so for example if we take
the partial derivative

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:19.855
with respect to X twice in a row,

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:22.195
we want it to be the case
that if you take that guy

00:01:22.195 --> 00:01:24.935
and you evaluate it at
the point of interest,

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.164
the point about which
we are approximating,

00:01:27.164 --> 00:01:28.953
it should be the same as when you take

00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:30.672
the second partial derivative of f

00:01:30.672 --> 00:01:32.598
or the corresponding
second partial derivative

00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:34.701
I should say since
there's multiple different

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.164
second partial derivatives,

00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:39.136
and you evaluate it at that same point.

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:40.634
And of course we want this to be true

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.991
not just with the second
partial derivative

00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:44.640
with respect to X twice in a row,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.870
but if we did it with the other ones.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:46.939
Like for example,

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.982
let's say we took the partial derivative

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:50.631
first with respect to X,

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.093
and then with respect to Y.

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:54.044
This is called the mixed
partial derivative.

00:01:54.044 --> 00:01:56.146
We want it to be the case
that when we evaluate that

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:59.206
at the point of interest
it's the same as taking

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:04.073
the mixed partial derivative
of f with respect to X,

00:02:04.073 --> 00:02:05.791
and then with respect to Y,

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:08.958
and we evaluate it at that same point.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.137
And remember, for almost all
functions that you deal with,

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:16.975
when you take this
second partial derivative

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:20.048
where we mix two of the variables,

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:21.765
it doesn't matter the order in which

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:22.598
you take them, right?

00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:24.774
You could take it first
with respect to X then Y

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.980
or you could it first with respect to Y,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.514
and then with respect to X.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:29.929
Usually these guys are equal.

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.042
There are some functions
for which this isn't true,

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.286
but we're going to basically assume that

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.120
we're dealing with
functions where this is.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.536
So, that's the only
mixed partial derivative

00:02:37.536 --> 00:02:39.207
that we have to take into account.

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:42.353
And I'll just kind of get
rid of that guy there.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:44.720
And then, of course, the final one,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.265
just to have it on record here,

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:48.541
is that we want the partial derivative

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:50.792
when we take it with respect to Y

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:51.908
two times in a row

00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:54.252
and we evaluate that at the same point,

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:55.720
there's kind of a lot,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.904
there's a lot of writing that goes on

00:02:56.904 --> 00:02:59.480
with these things and that's just kind of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.469
par for the course when it comes

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:01.839
to multi-variable calculus,

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:03.984
but you take the partial derivative

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.998
with respect to Y, add both of them,

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:09.086
and you want it to be the
same value at this point.

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:10.387
So even though there's
a lot going on here,

00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:12.476
all I'm basically saying is all the second

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.690
to partial differential
information should be the same

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.199
for Q as it is for f.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.126
So, let's actually go up and take a look

00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:21.542
at our function and start thinking about

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:22.832
what it's partial derivatives are.

00:03:22.832 --> 00:03:26.315
What it's first and second
partial derivatives are.

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:27.148
And to do that,

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.264
let me first just kind of clear up

00:03:29.264 --> 00:03:31.097
some of the board here

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.932
just to make it so we can actually start

00:03:33.932 --> 00:03:37.670
computing what this second
partial derivative is.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.809
So let's go ahead and do it.

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.830
First, this partial derivative
with respect to X twice,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.856
what we'll do is I'll
take one of those out

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.085
and think partial derivative
with respect to X.

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:47.409
And then on the inside I'm going to put

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.439
what the partial derivative
of this entire expression

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.424
with respect to X is.

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:54.315
But we just take it one term at a time.

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:56.232
This first term here is a constant,

00:03:56.232 --> 00:03:58.065
so that goes to zero.

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:01.757
The second term here actually
has the variable X in it.

00:04:01.757 --> 00:04:03.429
And when we take it's partial derivative,

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:05.247
since this is a linear term,

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:07.540
it's just going to be that
constant sitting in front of it.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.862
So it will be that
constant which is the value

00:04:09.862 --> 00:04:13.249
of the partial derivative
of f with respect to X

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.166
evaluated at the point of interest.

00:04:17.172 --> 00:04:18.632
And that's just a constant.

00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:20.093
All right, so that's there.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.616
This next term has no Xs in it,

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.311
so that's just going to go to zero.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:27.254
This term is interesting
because it's got an X in it.

00:04:27.254 --> 00:04:29.530
So when we take its
derivative with respect to X,

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.900
that two comes down.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.988
So this will be two times a,

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.748
whatever the constant a is,

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:37.331
multiplied by X minus X naught.

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.925
That's what the derivative
of this component is

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:42.434
with respect to X.

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:43.758
Then this over here,

00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:45.315
this also has an X,

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:47.372
but it's just showing up
basically as a linear term.

00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:48.858
And when we treat Y as a constant,

00:04:48.858 --> 00:04:50.414
since we're taking the partial derivative

00:04:50.414 --> 00:04:51.923
with respect to X,

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:55.939
what that ends up being
is b multiplied by that,

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:58.632
what looks like a constant
as far as X is concerned,

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:00.543
Y minus Y naught.

00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:02.866
And then the last term
doesn't have any Xs in it.

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:05.791
So that is the first partial derivative

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:07.327
with respect to X.

00:05:07.327 --> 00:05:08.186
And now we do it again.

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:10.834
Now we take the partial
derivative with respect to X,

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:12.273
and I'll hmm,

00:05:12.273 --> 00:05:14.085
maybe I should actually clear up

00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:15.802
even more of this guy.

00:05:15.802 --> 00:05:17.195
And now when we take
the partial derivative

00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:19.959
of this expression with respect to X,

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.561
f of X of X naught, Y naught,

00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:22.653
that's just a constant,

00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:24.324
so that goes to zero.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.727
Two times a times X, that's going to,

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:29.190
we take the derivative with respect to X

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.652
and we're just going to get two times a.

00:05:31.652 --> 00:05:33.254
And this last term
doesn't have an Xs in it,

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:34.834
so that also goes to zero.

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:35.994
So conveniently,

00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:38.502
when we take the second partial derivative

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:40.198
of Q with respect to X,

00:05:40.198 --> 00:05:41.520
We just get a constant.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.190
It's this constant to a.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.025
And since we want it to be the case,

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:49.608
we want that this entire
thing is equal to,

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:52.666
well what do we want?

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.570
We want it to be the
second partial derivative

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.055
of f both times with respect to X.

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:59.029
So here I'm going to use
the subscript notation.

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.909
Over here I'm using the
kind of Leibniz notation,

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.375
but here just second partial derivative

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:03.815
with respect to X,

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:06.067
we want it to match
whatever that looks like

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:09.295
when we evaluate it at
the point of interest.

00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:10.782
So what we could do to make that happen,

00:06:10.782 --> 00:06:13.170
to make sure that two
a is equal to this guy,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.253
is we set a equal to one half of that

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:21.621
second partial derivative evaluated

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:23.704
at the point of interest.

00:06:24.943 --> 00:06:26.651
Okay. So this is something
we kind of tuck away.

00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:28.318
We remember this is,

00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:31.991
we have solved for one of the constants.

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.872
So now let's start thinking
about another one of them.

00:06:33.872 --> 00:06:35.219
Well I guess actually I
don't have to scroll off

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.099
because let's say we just want to take

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:39.677
the mixed partial derivative here where

00:06:39.677 --> 00:06:41.999
if instead of taking it
with respect to X twice,

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.623
we wanted to, let's see
I'll kind of erase this,

00:06:44.623 --> 00:06:47.665
we wanted to first do
it with respect to X,

00:06:47.665 --> 00:06:49.754
and then do it with respect to Y.

00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:50.789
Then we can kind of just edit what

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.136
we have over here and we say,

00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:53.991
"we already took it with respect to X,

00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:56.824
"so now as our second go we're going to be

00:06:56.824 --> 00:06:59.028
"taking it with respect to Y."

00:06:59.028 --> 00:07:00.189
So in that case,

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:03.068
instead of getting two a
let's kind of figure out

00:07:03.068 --> 00:07:04.508
what it is that we get.

00:07:04.508 --> 00:07:06.250
When we take the derivative
of this whole guy

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.875
with respect to Y,

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:10.034
well this looks like a constant.

00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:11.753
This here also looks like a constant

00:07:11.753 --> 00:07:13.169
since we're doing it with respect to Y

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.539
and no Ys show up.

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.025
And the partial derivative of this

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:17.604
just ends up being b.

00:07:17.604 --> 00:07:19.485
So again, we just get a constant.

00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:22.178
This time it's b not two,

00:07:22.178 --> 00:07:23.363
previously it was two a,

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:24.826
but now it's just b.

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:26.451
And this time we want it to equal

00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.076
the mixed partial derivative.

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:30.445
So instead of saying f sub XX,

00:07:30.445 --> 00:07:32.813
I'm going to f XY which basically says

00:07:32.813 --> 00:07:34.452
you take the partial derivative first

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:36.799
with respect to X and
then with respect to Y.

00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:39.817
We want this guy to
equal the value of that

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:42.464
mixed partial derivative
evaluated at that point.

00:07:42.464 --> 00:07:43.300
So that gives us another fact.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.208
That means we can just
basically set b equal to that.

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:48.914
And this is another fact,

00:07:48.914 --> 00:07:51.120
another constant that we can record.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.287
And now for C,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:55.192
when we're trying to figure
out what that should be,

00:07:55.192 --> 00:07:56.956
the reasoning is almost identical.

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:58.025
It's pretty much symmetric.

00:07:58.025 --> 00:08:00.742
We did everything that
we did for the case X,

00:08:00.742 --> 00:08:03.331
and instead we do it for
taking the partial derivative

00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:05.406
with respect to Y twice in a row,

00:08:05.406 --> 00:08:06.939
and I encourage you to
do that for yourself.

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:08.944
It'll definitely solidify everything that

00:08:08.944 --> 00:08:10.801
we're doing here because it can seem

00:08:10.801 --> 00:08:12.868
kind of like a lot and
a lot of computations.

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:14.623
But you're going to get
basically the same conclusion

00:08:14.623 --> 00:08:16.241
you did for the constant a.

00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:18.726
It's going to be the case
that you have the constant c

00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:22.836
is equal to one half of the
second partial derivative

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:24.577
of f with respect to Y,

00:08:24.577 --> 00:08:26.899
so you're differentiating
with respect to Y twice

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:30.243
evaluated at the point of interest.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:33.494
So this is going to be
kind of the third fact.

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:35.537
And the way that you get
to that conclusion again,

00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:37.418
it's going to be almost
identical to the way

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:39.252
that we found this one for X.

00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:41.760
Now when you plug in these
values for a, b and c,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.898
and these are constants,

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:44.686
even though we've written them as formulas

00:08:44.686 --> 00:08:45.963
they are constants,

00:08:45.963 --> 00:08:48.958
when you plus those in
to this full formula,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.118
you're going to get the
quadratic approximation.

00:08:51.118 --> 00:08:52.697
It'll have six separate terms.

00:08:52.697 --> 00:08:54.554
One that corresponds to the constant,

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:56.807
two that correspond to the linear fact,

00:08:56.807 --> 00:08:58.150
and then three which correspond to

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.868
the various quadratic terms.

00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:01.447
And if you wanted to dig into more details

00:09:01.447 --> 00:09:03.844
and kind of go through an
example or two on this,

00:09:03.844 --> 00:09:06.584
I do have an article on
quadratic approximations

00:09:06.584 --> 00:09:08.139
and hopefully you can kind of step through

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:11.009
and do some of the computations
yourself as you go.

00:09:11.009 --> 00:09:12.357
But in all of this,

00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:14.145
even though there's a
lot of formulas going on,

00:09:14.145 --> 00:09:15.863
it can be pretty notationly heavy.

00:09:15.863 --> 00:09:16.990
I want you to think back to that

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.140
original graphical intuition, here,

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.135
let me actually pull up the
graphical intuition here.

00:09:22.135 --> 00:09:23.551
So if you're approximating a function

00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:25.130
near a specific point,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.221
the quadratic approximation looks like

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:29.521
this curve where if you were to chop it

00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.445
in any direction it would be a parabola,

00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:34.419
but it's hugging the graph pretty closely.

00:09:34.419 --> 00:09:36.440
So it gives up a pretty
close approximation.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.948
So even though there's a lot of formulas

00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:39.273
that go on to get us that,

00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:41.515
the ultimate visual and I
think the ultimate intuition

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.277
is actually a pretty sensible one.

00:09:43.277 --> 00:09:44.439
You're just hoping to find something that

00:09:44.439 --> 00:09:46.808
hugs the function nice and closely.

00:09:46.808 --> 00:09:49.272
And with that, I will see you next video.
