00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.740
In the last video, we set out
to figure out the surface area

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.410
of the walls of this
weird-looking building, where

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.880
the ceiling of the walls was
defined by the function f of xy

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.800
is equal to x plus y squared,
and then the base of this

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.030
building, or the contour of its
walls, was defined by the path

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.100
where we have a circle of
radius 2 along here, then we go

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.230
down along the y-axis, and then
we take another left, and we go

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.450
along the x-axis, and
that was our building.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.790
And in the last video, we
figured out this first

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.830
wall's surface area.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.570
In fact, you can think of it,
our original problem is, we

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.730
wanted to figure out the line
integral along the closed path,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.360
so it was a closed line
integral, along the closed path

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.770
c of f of xy, and we're always
multiplying f of xy times a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.720
little bit, a little, small
distance of our path, ds.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.550
We're writing this in the
most abstract way possible.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.800
And what we saw in the last
video is, the easiest way to do

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.560
this is to break this up into
multiple paths, or into

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.990
multiple problems.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.700
So you can imagine, this whole
contour, this whole path we

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.900
call c, but we could call this
part, we figured out in

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.330
the last video, c1.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.430
This part we can call, let me
make a pointer, c2, and this

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.010
point right here is c3.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.640
So we could redefine, or we can
break up, this line integral,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.540
this closed-line integral, into
3 non-closed line integrals.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.340
This will be equal to the line
integral along the path c1 of f

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:40.560
of xy ds, plus the line
integral along c2 of f of x y

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.900
ds plus the line integral, you
might have guessed it, along c3

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.930
of f of xy ds, and in the last
video, we got as far as

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.340
figuring out this first part,
this first curvy wall

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.490
all right here.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.870
Its surface area, we figured
out, was 4 plus 2 pi.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.960
Now we've got to figure
out the other 2 parts.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.850
So let's do C2, let's do
this line integral next.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.600
And in order to do it,
we need to do another

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.540
parameterization of x and y.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.620
It's going to be different than
what we did for this part.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.570
We're no longer along
this circle, we're

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.390
just along the y-axis.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.570
So as long as we're there,
x is definitely going

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.750
to be equal to 0.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.060
So that's my parameterization,
x is equal to 0.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.070
If we're along the y-axis, x
is definitely equal to 0.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.710
And then y, we could say it
starts off at y is equal to 2.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.790
Maybe we'll say y is equal to 2
minus t, for t is between 0, t

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.230
is greater than or equal to
0, less than or equal to 2.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.270
And that should work.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.300
When t is equal to 0, we're at
this point right there, and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.900
then as t increases towards 2,
we move down the y-axis, until

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.270
eventually when t is equal
to 2, we're at that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.080
point right there.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.780
So that's our parameterization.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530
And so let's evaluate this
line, and we could do our

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.250
derivatives, too, if we like.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.920
What's the derivative,
I'll write it over here.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.290
What's dx dt?

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.230
Pretty straightforward.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.550
Derivative of 0 is 0, and
dy dt is equal to the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.400
derivative of this.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.930
It's just minus 1, right?

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.030
2 minus t, derivative of
minus t, is just minus 1.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.940
And so let's just break it up.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.540
So we have this thing right
here, so we have the

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.635
integral along c2.

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:28.490
But let's, instead of writing
c2, I'll leave c2 there, but

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.450
we'll say were going from t is
equal to 0 to 2 of f of xy.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.690
f of xy is this thing right
here, is x plus y squared,

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.090
and then times ds.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.420
 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.410
And we know from the last
several videos, ds can be

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.350
rewritten as the square root of
dx dt squared, so 0 squared,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.340
plus dy dt squared, so minus 1
squared is 1, all

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.910
of that times dt.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.390
And obviously, this is
pretty nice and clean.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.640
This is 0 plus 1, square
root, this just becomes 1.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.260
And then what is x?

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.330
x, if we write it in terms of
our parameterization, is always

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.780
going to be equal to 0, and
then y squared is going to

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.280
be 2 minus is t squared.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.490
So this is going to be
2 minus t squared.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.020
So this whole crazy thing
simplified to, we're going to

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.240
go from t is equal to 0 to t is
equal to 2, the x disappears in

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.330
our parameterization, x just
stays 0, regardless of what

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.070
t is, and then you have y
squared, but y is the same

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.180
thing as 2 minus t, so 2 minus
t squared, and then you have

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.440
your dt sitting out there.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.840
This is pretty straightforward.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.910
I always find it easier when
you're finding an

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.780
antiderivative of this,
although you can do this in

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.610
your head, I like to
just actually multiply

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.720
out this binomial.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.340
So this is going to be equal to
the antiderivative from t is

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:16.230
equal to 0 to t is equal to 2
of 4 minus 2 minus 4t plus t

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.690
squared, plus t squared,
just like that dt.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.290
And this is pretty
straightforward.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.150
This is going to be, the
antiderivative of this is 4

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.750
t minus 2 t squared, right?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.580
When you take the derivative,
there's 2 times minus 2 is

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:43.200
minus 4 t, and then you have
plus 1/3 t to the third, right?

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.190
These are just simple
antiderivatives, and we need

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.300
to evaluate it from 0 to 2.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.180
And so let's evaluate it at 2.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.140
4 times 2 is 8, let
me pick a new color.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:02.560
4 times 2 is 8, minus 2 times 2
squared, so 2 times 4, so minus

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.800
8, plus 1/3 times 2
to the third power.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.910
So 1/3 times 8.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.970
So these cancel out.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.530
We have 8 minus 8, and
we just have 8/3.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.530
So this just becomes 8/3.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.470
And then we have to put a 0 in,
minus 0 evaluate here, but

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.320
it's just going to be 0.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.180
We have 4 times 0, two times 0,
all of these are going to be 0.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.730
So minus 0.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.700
So just like that, we
found our surface area

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.210
of our second wall.

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.250
This turned out being,
this right here is 8/3.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.890
And now we have our last
wall, and then we can

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.380
just add them up.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.640
So we have our last wall.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.800
I'll do another
parameterization.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.180
I want to have the graph there.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.620
Well, maybe I can
paste it again.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.990
Edit.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.590
So there's the graph again.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.250
And now we're going
to do our last wall.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.870
So our last wall is this one
right here, which is, we

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.930
could write it, you
know, this was c3.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.750
Let me switch colors here.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:06.420
So this is c, we're going to go
along contour c3 of f of xy ds,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.170
which is the same thing as,
let's do a parameterization.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.580
Along this curve, if we just
say, x is equal to t, very

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.770
straight forward, for t is
greater than or equal to 0,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.420
less than or equal to 2, and
this whole time that we're

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.520
along the x-axis, y is
going to be equal to 0.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.650
That's pretty straightforward
parameterization.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.100
So this is going to be equal
to, we're going to go from t is

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:37.845
equal to 0 to t is equal to 2
of f of xy, which is, I'll

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:41.860
write in terms of x right now,
x and y, x plus y

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.760
squared times ds.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.970
Now, what is dx-- well, let
me write ds right here.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.690
Times ds.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.520
That's what we're dealing with.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.870
Now we know what ds is.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:08:01.030
ds is equal to the square
root of dx dt squared plus

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.940
dy dt squared times dt.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.510
We proved that in
the first video.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.690
Or we didn't rigorously prove
it, but we got the sense

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.980
of why this is true.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.560
And what's the derivative
of x with respect to t?

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.890
Well, that's just 1, so this
is just going to be a 1,

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.250
1 squared, same thing.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.030
And the derivative of y
with respect to z is 0.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.840
So this is is 0, 1 plus 0 is
1, square root of 1 is 1.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.090
So this thing just becomes dt.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.290
ds is going to be equal
to dt, in this case.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.510
So this just becomes a dt.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.515
And then our x is going to be
equal to a t, that's part

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.460
of our definition of our
parameterization, and y is

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.090
zero, so we can ignore it.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.710
So this was a
super-simple integral.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.580
So this simplified down to,
we're going to go from 0 to 2

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.540
of t dt, which is equal to the
antiderivative of t is just 1/2

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.240
t squared, and we're going to
go 0 to 2, which is equal

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.160
to 1/2 times 2 squared.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.780
2 squared is 4, times 1/2
is 2, and then minus 1/2

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.410
times 0 squared, minus 0.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.860
So this third wall's area
right there is just 2.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.390
Pretty straightforward.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.580
So that right there, the
area there, is just 2.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.270
And so to answer our question,
what was this line integral

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:27.420
evaluated over this
closed path of f of xy?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.870
Well, we just add
up these numbers.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.980
We have 4 plus 2 pi plus 8/3
plus 2, well, what is this.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:39.530
8/3 is same thing as 2 and 2/3,
so we have 4 plus 2 and 2/3 is

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.290
6 and 2/3, plus another 2 is 8
and 2/3, so this whole thing

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.880
becomes 8 and 2/3, if we
write it as a mixed

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.470
number, plus 2 pi.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.550
And we're done!

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.190
And we're done.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.210
Now we can start trying to
do line integrals with
