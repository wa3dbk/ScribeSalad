00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.630
On Monday morning, there
were 12 inches

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.290
of snow on the ground.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.130
The weather warmed up, and
by Tuesday morning,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.520
2 inches had melted.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.440
All right, so we'll
have 10 left.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.350
2 more inches melted by
Wednesday morning.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.980
This pattern continued
throughout the week until no

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.300
more snow was left.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.280
So they're essentially saying
that we had 12 inches of snow

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.790
on the ground on Monday and that
every day after that, two

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.640
inches melted.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.220
So after Tuesday, you'd have
10 inches, and after

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.780
Wednesday, you'd have
eight inches, and

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.220
that pattern continued.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.640
And what they say is create an
equation and a graph to show

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.790
the relationship between the day
and the amount of snow on

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.330
the ground.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.670
So let's define a variable that
tells us how far away we

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.670
are from Monday.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.010
So let's let x equal
days after Monday.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.050
And then let y be equal to
inches of snow on the ground.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.110
So, one way to think about it
is, OK, when x is 0, when

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.905
we're on Monday, when we're 0
days after Monday, we're going

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.880
to have 12 inches of snow on
the ground, and every day

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.280
after that, we're going
to lose two inches.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.550
So if we're on Tuesday, we're
going to have 2 inches times

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.975
1, because Tuesday is one day,
so if x is 1, that means we're

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:34.890
on Tuesday.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.130
If x is 2, that means we're 2
times 2, we've lost 4 inches,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.770
which is what the case
is on Wednesday.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.280
So this is our equation for the
relationship between the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370
day and the amount of
snow on the ground.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.885
x is the day, how many days
after Monday, and then y is

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.440
the inches of the snow
left on the ground.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.670
We start with 12, and
then every day we

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060
lose exactly two inches.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.310
Now let's graph this.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.009
So I'll make my vertical axis
the y-axis, that's inches on

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.780
the ground.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.420
y is equal to inches
left on the ground.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.400
And then the horizontal axis,
that is our x-axis-- let me

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.940
scroll down a little bit-- this
is days after Monday.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.790
And so we have 0 days after
Monday, we have 1, 2,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.000
3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.630
And then on Monday, which is
exactly 0 days after Monday,

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.380
that is Monday, we have 12
inches on the ground.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.970
So I'll do it up here, so we
have 12 inches on the ground

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.210
right there.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.740
And actually, I could do
a table if you like.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.420
Let me draw this.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.610
So if we do x and y, this is
the days after Monday, so

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.050
there's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.730
And then on the first day, we
have 12 inches, on Monday, 0

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.770
days after Monday.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.610
Then we lose two inches
each day.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.600
On day 1 we have 10, day
2, 8, 6, 4, 2, 0.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.690
So let's plot these points.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.240
We already plotted 0, 12
in that blue color.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.820
Now let's plot 1, 10.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.505
1, 10 is right about there.

00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:41.690
It'll be right over there.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.500
Then we can plot 2, 8.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.730
So 2 days after Monday,
we have 8

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.450
inches left on the ground.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.580
So this is on Wednesday,
so that's 8 inches.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.650
And then on 3 days after Monday,
we have 6 inches on

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.900
the ground.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.340
You can see that a line
is forming here.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.810
And then if we go to 4 days
after Monday, we have 4 inches

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.060
on the ground.

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.890
So that is 4.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.850
And then 5 days after
Monday, we have 2

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.100
inches on the ground.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.350
And then finally, on the sixth
day, 6 days after Monday-- so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.650
what are we at, Sunday now-- we
are going to have no inches

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.550
on the ground.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.450
So that's that right there.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.580
And you can see that there's
this line that formed, because

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.720
this is a linear relationship.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.230
It looks a little curvy because
I didn't draw it

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.690
perfectly, but that is a line.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.660
So we've done everything.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.010
We've created the equation.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.030
We start with 12 inches,
every day after

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.500
that we lose two inches.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.050
And we showed a graph that
depicts the relationship.
