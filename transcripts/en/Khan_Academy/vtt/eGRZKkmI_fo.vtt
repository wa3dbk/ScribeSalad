00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.920
What I want to do in the next
few videos is try to see what

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.780
happens to a line integral,
either a line integral over a

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.870
scalar field or a vector field,
but what happens that line

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.370
integral when we change the
direction of our path?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.560
So let's say, when I say change
direction, let's say that

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.820
I have some curve C that
looks something like this.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.760
We draw the x- and y- axis.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.180
So that's my y-axis, that is
my x-axis, and let's say my

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.560
parameterization starts there,
and then as t increases, ends

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.120
up over there just like that.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.230
So it's moving in
that direction.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.130
And when I say I reverse
the path, we could

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.350
define another curve.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.430
Let's call it minus C, that
looks something like this.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.150
That is my y-axis,
that is my x-axis.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.690
And it looks exactly the same,
but it starts up here, and then

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
as t increases, it goes down
to the starting point

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.370
of the other curve.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.320
So it's the exact same shape
of a curve, but it goes in

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.530
the opposite direction.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.310
So what I'm going to do in this
video is just understand how we

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.490
can construct a
parameterization like this, and

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.010
hopefully understand
it pretty well.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.320
And then next two videos after
this, we'll try to see what

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
this actually does to the line
integral, one for a scalar

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.850
field, and then one
for a vector field.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.430
So let's just say, this
parameterization right here,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.630
let's just define it in the
basic way that we've

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.500
always defined them.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.540
Let's say that this is x is
equal to x of t, y is equal to

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.280
y of t, and let's say this is
from t is equal, or t,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.670
let me write this way.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.695
t starts at a, so t is
greater than or equal to

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:42.290
a, and it goes up to b.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.070
So in this example, this was
when t is equal to a, and the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:55.000
point right here is the
coordinate x of a, y of a.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.590
And then when t is equal to b
up here, this is really just a

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.870
review of what we've seen
before, really just a review of

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.270
parameterization, when t is
equal to b up here, this is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.160
the point x of b, y of b.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.980
Nothing new there.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.570
Now given these functions, how
can we construct another

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.140
parameterization here that has
the same shape, but

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.460
that starts here?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.660
So I want this to be,
t is equal to a.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.600
Let me switch colors.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.570
Let me switch to,
maybe, magenta.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.460
So I want this to be t is equal
to a, and as t increases, I

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.020
want this to be t equals b.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.270
So I want to move in the
opposite direction.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.950
So when t is equal to a,
I want my coordinate to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.470
still be x of b, y of b.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.350
When t is equal to a, I want a
b in each of these functions,

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.150
and when t is equal to b, I
want the coordinate to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.400
be x of a, y of a.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.630
Right?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.770
Notice, they're opposites now.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.180
Here t is equal to a, x
of a, y of a, here t is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.700
equal to b, our endpoint.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.460
Now I'm at this coordinate,
x of a, y of a.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.520
So how do I construct that?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.450
Well, if you think about it,
when t is equal to a, we want

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.740
both of these functions
to evaluate it at b.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.210
So what if we define our x, in
this case, for our minus C

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.900
curve, what if we say x is
equal to x of, and when I say x

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.700
of I'm talking about the
same exact function.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.240
Actually, maybe I should write
it in that same exact color.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.180
x of-- but instead of putting t
in there, instead of putting a

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.340
straight-up t in there, what if
I put an a plus b

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.030
minus t in there?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.520
What happens?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.010
Well, let me do it
for the y as well.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:54.310
So then our y, y, is equal
to y of a plus b minus t.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.920
a plus b minus is t.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.600
I'm using slightly different
shades of yellow, might be

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.180
a little disconcerting.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.030
Anyway, what happens
when we define this?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.000
When t is equal to a, when t is
equal to a, let's say that this

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
parameterization is also
for t starts at a and

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.470
then goes up to b.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.040
So let's just experiment and
confirm that this

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.560
parameterization really is the
same thing as this thing,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.070
but it goes in an
opposite direction.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.950
Or at least, confirm in
our minds intuitively.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:32.240
So when t is equal to a, when t
is equal to a, x will be equal

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.350
to x of a plus b
minus a, right?

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.040
This is when t is equal to
a, so minus t, or minus a,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.370
which is equal to what?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.960
Well, a minus a, cancel out,
that's equal to x of b.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.280
Similarly, when t is equal
to a, y will be equal to

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.840
y of a plus b minus a.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.990
The a's cancel out, so
it's equal to y of b.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.860
So that worked.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.480
When t is equal to a, my
parameterization evaluates to

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.160
the coordinate x of b, y of b.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.480
When t is equal to
a, x of b, y of b.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.210
Then we can do the exact same
thing when t is equal to b.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.450
I'll do it over here, because
I don't want to lose this.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.690
Let me just draw a line here.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160
I'm still dealing with this
parameterization over here.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.300
Actually, let me scroll over
to the right, just so that

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.380
I don't get confused.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.630
When t is equal to b, when t
is equal to b, what does x

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.310
equal? x is equal to x of
a plus b minus b, right?

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.580
a plus b minus b when
t is equal to b.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.420
So that's equal to x of a.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.000
and then when she's able to be
why is equal to lie of a plus b

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.080
minus b, and of course, that's
going to be equal to y of a.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.410
So the endpoints work, and if
you think about it intuitively,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.010
as t increases, so when t is at
a, this thing is going

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.270
to be x of b, y of b.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.990
We saw that down here.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.760
Now as t increases, this
value is going to decrease.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.340
We started x of b, y of b, and
as t increases, this value is

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.640
going to decrease to a, right?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.940
It starts from b,
and it goes to a.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.370
This one obviously starts
at a, and it goes to b.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.490
So hopefully, that should give
you the intuition why this is

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.610
the exact same curve as that.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.270
It just goes in a completely
opposite direction.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.570
Now, with that out of the way,
if you accept what I've told

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.540
you, that these are really
the same parameterizations,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.770
just opposite directions.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.050
I shouldn't say same
parameterizations.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.500
Same curve going in an opposite
direction, or same path going

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.700
in the opposite direction.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.530
In the next video, I'm going to
see what happens when we

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:00.550
evaluate this line integral, f
of x ds, versus this

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.760
line integral.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.020
So this is a scalar field, a
line integral of a scalar

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.750
field, using this curve or this
path, but what happens if we

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:18.050
take a line integral over the
same scalar field, but we do

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.150
it over this reverse path?

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.690
That's what we're going
to do in the next video.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.510
And the video after that, we'll
do it for vector fields.
