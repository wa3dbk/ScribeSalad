00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.460
The government has said a lot
about the fact that this $700

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.240
billion might not just be a
blank check, that we're

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.490
actually buying assets.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.150
And, who knows, maybe
we'll even make a

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.530
profit on the assets.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.920
And I've hinted and other people
have hinted that, well,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.500
that's very unlikely because
these assets, they're probably

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.820
not worth what the government's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.460
going to pay for it.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.090
And one could argue that even
some of these are worth 0.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.230
And I've gotten some letters and
I've heard other people on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.720
the news actually say, well,
how could they be worth 0?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.370
They're backed by mortgages,
which are backed by houses,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.119
which are the collateral.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.350
That's where the collateral
comes from, the collateralized

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.330
debt obligations.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.200
So in this video I'm going to
do, hopefully, a reasonably

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.980
straightforward example to show
you why some of these

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.180
collateralized debt obligations
could be worth

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.030
very little or maybe
even nothing.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.050
So let's do something simple.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680
Let's not talk in terms of
millions of homes, let's talk

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.720
in terms of 10 homes.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.820
Let's say I were to create
a very small

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.140
mortgage-backed security.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.180
Essentially, I give
out 10 mortgages.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.460
Right?

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.010
Let's say each mortgage
is $1 million.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.050
Let's say that's 10 times
1 million more.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.320
10 times $1 million.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.720
And the people who I give those
mortgages to buy ten $1

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.450
million houses.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.440
Right?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.910
So, I create a corporation, a
special purpose entity, for

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.630
the sake of this mortgage-backed
security for

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.620
constructing these
collateralized debt

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.870
obligations.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.800
That's my company I create,
the balance sheet of it.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.130
What are the assets?

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.370
Well, I have 10 mortgages times
a million so I have $10

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.400
million in loans, essentially,
$10 million in mortgages.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.190
And they're collateralized
or they're backed by the

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.330
underlying houses that these
mortgages were used to buy.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.390
$10 million in mortgages,
$10 million more, right?

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.750
Now, how is this special purpose
entity-- we'll call it

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.160
an S.P.E.-- how is this S.P.E.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.550
funded?

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.390
Well, it's essentially funded
by the people who are buying

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.470
the collateralized
debt obligations.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.050
And collateralized debt
obligations are essentially

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.350
just debt that is used to
fund these mortgages.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.000
And what's interesting about
a collateralized debt

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.075
obligation-- see in a
mortgage-backed security, I

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.470
would have just given these
$10 million mortgages and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.650
then, in this corporation, I
would have just issued a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.650
thousand shares.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.600
And so each share would hold
1/1000 of this value, right?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.230
That's a mortgage-backed
security.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.810
But in a collateralized
debt obligation, I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.260
split it into buckets.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.830
So what I do is, let's say
I borrow three tranches.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.080
Just call that buckets.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.660
So I go to some people and I
borrow, I don't know, of that

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.060
$10 million that I said you lent
out, I borrow-- I don't

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.120
know-- let me say-- I'll make
up a number-- $5 million.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.850
%5 million from these people,
and these are

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.930
the senior debt holders.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.370
So essentially, both this debt
holder and this debt holder

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.930
has to get wiped out before
this guy gets impaired.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.280
Impaired just means that
you get less money

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.830
than you lent, right?

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.730
So I borrow $5 million from
somebody else and I'm going to

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.900
pay them the lowest interest
rate because this is the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.770
safest bucket.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.060
So think of it this way: let's
say these 10 mortgages, let's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.200
say that I'm getting 8%.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.370
And let's say that I'm paying,
let me draw, they're giving me

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.190
$5 million.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.010
Let's say that I'll
pay these guys 5%.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.600
And why are they willing to take
a lower interest rate?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.460
Because essentially any default
on this side will hit

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.750
these two buckets before
it hits these people.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.640
So this'll be an arguably very
safe debt instrument.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.010
And I'll do more about
that in a second.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.380
And let's say I borrow
another $4 million

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.190
from some other people.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.360
So they gave me $4 million.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.600
I have to pay a little bit
higher interest to them.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.410
I have to pay 6% interest
to them, right?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.180
And then, finally, I borrow
another $1 million.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.400
I borrow $1 million from people
who are willing to take

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.140
the biggest risk.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.920
So if there's any defaults over
here, these people are

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.064
going to be wiped out before
these people get touched.

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:22.230
And actually, we can figure out
the appropriate amount of

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.760
interest, right?

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.680
How much money is coming in per
month before anyone starts

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.170
defaulting?

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.750
Let's see, I'm getting $800,000
in per month.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.190
That's the inflow.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.950
And then on the outflow, I have
to pay these people 5

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.650
million times 5%.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:38.990
That's $250,000.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.360
So that's how much I'm paying
to that tranche.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.750
$250,000.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.500
And then four times 6%.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.650
That's $240,000, minus 240.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.100
So that's what, 800 minus 490.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.370
So then I have 310,000
left, right?

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.590
So I can essentially pay
this $310,000 per

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.100
year to this tranche.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.460
So they're going to actually get
a 31% interest. And that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.920
sounds great.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.230
That's why they call that the
equity tranche normally in a

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.700
CDO because those people
get a lot of upside.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.930
But guess what: if there's any
default, these people get

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.570
wiped out first. And just to
make this example clear, let's

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.880
do it very simply because you
could model this out and

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.560
assume some type of prepayment
et cetera, et cetera.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.150
Let me scratch this
out right here.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.330
Let's say that one year out,
half of the mortgages, I don't

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.330
know, the people refinance or
they move or they sell their

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.920
house or whatever.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.450
So they just prepay
the mortgage.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.670
So let's say in one year.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.280
Let me redraw this balance
sheet in one year.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.030
So in one year, let's say five
of those borrowers-- so this

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.490
is a year later.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.170
Magenta is my color
for a year later.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.050
A year later, half of those
borrowers just refinance or

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.160
they sell their house.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.370
And so they just pay us back
$5 million, right?

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.050
So we get $5 million.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.530
I'll put that on the
asset side of the

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.170
balance sheet, right?

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.420
This is assets.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.130
There's a bunch of videos on
assets and liabilities and

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.530
balance sheets if this
confuses you.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.380
And there's no equity in
this company, right?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.270
Because assets minus liability
is equity.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.330
And I did that because these are
special purpose entities.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.560
Their whole purpose is to
structure these securities.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.920
Their purpose really isn't to
be an ongoing operation that

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.020
has net income in and of
itself, although there

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.070
probably was equity in the
bank who constructed this

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.320
probably took at all.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.660
OK, so we said half the
people refinance.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.100
Those people were great.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.520
They were worth giving the money
to because they paid off

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.570
their loans in whole.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.250
But guess what?

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:54.140
The other half of the people,
the title of subprime was

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.700
deserving of them,
and they default.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.010
And we have to foreclose on
them a year later, right?

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.090
But all is not lost, right?

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.280
We don't lose that $5 million
that we lent those other 5

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.450
million people because they
had homes, right?

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.290
These are collateralized
debt obligations.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.460
We are able to take
their houses.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.990
Unfortunately, it's a really
weak real estate market and

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.200
let's say, just for the sake
of argument, we take those

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.550
five houses from the people
who didn't pay, right?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.770
Five paid, five didn't pay.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.790
We take the five who
didn't pay houses.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.830
And let's say, when we sell
them, let's say we're only

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.230
able to get, I don't know, 60%
on those houses, right?

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.820
So 60% of $5 million.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.750
We're essentially only able to
get $3 million for the houses

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.000
we've foreclosed on.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.660
So a year later, what are
all of our assets?

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.850
We get the $5 million in cash
from the people who are good

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.270
and paid off their mortgages.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.100
And then we get the $3 million
from the people who

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.940
foreclosed.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.930
And then we only got 60% of
the original purchase

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:57.610
price of the homes.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.180
We only got that on
the foreclosure.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.850
That makes sense because
credit's getting tighter, and

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.450
it's a tough mortgage market,
and all these houses were in

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.490
South Florida or Las
Vegas or whatever.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.860
But what happens now?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.890
There's really no purpose for
this entity to even exist

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.870
anymore because everyone's
paid off.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.730
There's no income streams
coming in or out.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.520
So essentially we will just
dissolve the corporation and

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.900
give everyone what
they're due.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.650
Well, this guy, he gets first
dibs on it, right?

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.270
He took the lowest interest rate
in exchange for having

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.550
the lowest risk.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.130
So that guy right there, I'll
draw him in green because he's

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.710
good to go.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.570
This tranche right here, he
gets a full $5 million.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.230
That's great.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.020
He got 5% interest and he got
all of his money back.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.809
Sounds great.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.980
The CDOs look safe so far.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.600
But what about this next
tranche, this $4 million guy.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.440
He didn't do so good, right?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.050
The $4 million guy, that's what
he was owed, that's what

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.490
he essentially lent the special
purpose entity.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.710
This $4 million tranche
of CDOs.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.350
He's owed $4 million,
but guess what?

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.410
After you pay this guy $5
million, there's only $3

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:04.480
million left.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.470
So this guy only gets
$3 million.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.280
So for every $4 he lent,
he only gets $3.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.993
So this guy gets $0.75
on the dollar.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.870
That's a seven, right there.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.310
I write my sevens
like a European.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.640
But what happens to that equity

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.980
tranche, this guy up here?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.360
This $1 million, right?

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.740
He thought he was a genius.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.570
He lent this money and he was
getting a 31% interest.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.370
Sounded good and, frankly, the
bank probably wasn't able to

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.010
unload this to anyone because
pension funds and a lot of

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.210
these foreign governments,
they only buy the safer

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:45.970
assets, right?

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.230
So this is the stuff that's
probably sitting on a lot of

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.210
these investment bank
balance sheets.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.970
These are the smelly, toxic,
stinky assets that people are

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.090
talking about.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.330
And guess what?

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.280
There's nothing left to pay this
$1 million to this guy.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.780
You pay $5 to this guy.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.710
This guy only got $0.75
on the dollar, right?

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.690
He was impaired by
$1 million here.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.540
And then this last tranche
up here: he gets nothing.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.470
So the question is: these CDOs
that are on banks's balance

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.400
sheets, are they these CDOs?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.720
Are they a share in that tranche
of debt, in which

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.770
case, they're very safe.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.190
But I would argue in which case
the banks probably aren't

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.230
looking to unload them as
quickly, or they can probably

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.220
find buyers.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.580
Are they this tranche, in which
case maybe they're worth

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.600
$0.75, but you know even at
$0.75, you're just going to

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.440
break even?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.120
Maybe they're worth, at $0.60
on the dollar, maybe

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.840
they're a good deal.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.450
Or are they this stuff?

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.780
And if they're this stuff,
then they really, really,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.480
really are worth nothing,
at least in the

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.760
example I just gave.
