00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.022
We're in problem number seven.

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:05.580
Let me switch colors.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.330
The average of the weights
of 14 books is p pounds.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.080
In terms of p, what is
the total weight of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.470
the books in pounds?

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.620
So this comes up all the
time in the SAT.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.010
The average of weights of
14 books is p pounds.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.970
So if you had weight 1, plus
weight 2, plus-- if I were to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.300
add all 14 books, that's just
the weights of all the 14

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.210
books, and I were to divide
by 14, that is equal to p.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.310
This is just the definition
of average.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.690
You add up the weights of all
the books, divide by the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.680
number of books, and you
get the average.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.500
Well, if you multiply both sides
by 14 you get w1-- you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.390
get the sum of all of the
weights of the books is equal

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.100
to what? p times 14.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.760
And what are they asking?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.080
In terms of p, what is
the total weight

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.970
of all of the books?

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.260
Well, this is the total weight
of all of the books, right?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.350
I just take the weight of the
first one, plus the weight of

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.980
the second one, and keep adding
until I get to the

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.380
weight of the 14th, and that
is equal to p times 14.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.700
And that is choice E.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.000
14p.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.770
Choice E.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.860
Next problem.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.110
Problem eight.

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:24.286
Draw the axes.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.820
This is x and y.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.190
And then they draw-- let me do
it in a different color.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.460
They have point A, which
is 2, negative 1.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.010
So it's 2 comma negative 1.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.970
So this is the point
x is equal to 2.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.560
If we were to go down, this
is y equal negative 1.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.330
And then they have point
B, which is k,t.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.450
And then they have point C
up here-- C is 2 comma 5.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
So it's 2 comma and this is 5.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.530
Point B is the midpoint of AC.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
So point B is this
midpoint of AC.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.670
So this distance is the
same as that distance.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.250
What is the value of t?

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.190
So what's its y value?

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.540
We know what k is, k's going
to have to be 2.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.790
So what's the y value?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.780
So the y value's essentially
just going to be the average

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.980
of this y value and that y
value, because it's right in

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.380
the middle of the two.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.680
So it's going to be 5
plus minus 1 over 2,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.070
which is equal to what?

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.060
That's equal to 4 over 2,
which is equal to 2.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.090
So this point, right here,
is going to be 2 comma 2.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.910
And all I did is I took the
average of the y values.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.610
The other way you could have
thought about it is, what is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.000
this total distance?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.600
What's the distance from
5 to negative 1?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.010
Well, that's 6.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.435
So this distance would be 3.

00:02:58.435 --> 00:03:00.330
And what's 5 minus 3?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.690
It's 2 as well.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.340
But the easiest way is just to
average this y value and this

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.330
y value, and you'll get the
y value for the midpoint.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.920
And that is choice C.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.170
Next problem.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.100
Problem nine.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.130
So far I didn't have to draw
anything, this is pretty good.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:33.130
If k times 2x plus 3, times x
minus 1 is equal to 0, and

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.960
they also tell us that x is
greater than 1, what is the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.370
value of k?

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.250
So let's see, if for this times
this, times this to

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.770
equal 0, at least one of them
has to be equal to 0.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.530
Maybe more than one,
maybe all of them.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.670
In order for this term to be 0,
what does x have to equal?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.225
Well, for x to be 0 here-- for
this term to be 0, sorry-- x

00:04:00.225 --> 00:04:01.470
would have to be equal to 1.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.980
How did I get that?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.580
I said x minus 1
is equal to 0.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.640
Add 1 to both sides,
x is equal to 1.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.030
Well, they told us that x
is greater than 1, so x

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.490
cannot equal 1.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.460
So this cannot happen.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.910
That cannot happen, because
x is greater than 1.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.050
So we know that this is not 0.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.850
This term is not-- this might
not equal-- that's

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.480
not equal to 0.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.830
What has to be a value for
x for this term to be 0?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.630
2x plus 3 equals 0.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.350
Subtract 3 from both sides.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.960
2x is equal to minus 3.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.500
x is equal to minus 3/2.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.650
Once again, they tell us that
x has to be greater than 1.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.950
If x is greater than 1, we know
that x cannot be minus

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.760
3/2, because obviously
this is less than 1.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.750
So once again, we know that this
term does not equal 0.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.650
So if this term doesn't equal 0,
this term doesn't equal 0.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.770
But when I multiply all three
of these terms I get 0.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.420
This k has to equal 0.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.360
This is non-zero, this
is non-zero.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.310
If I'm getting 0 when I multiply
them, k has to be 0,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.150
and that's choice B.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.540
Next problem.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.390
Problem number 10.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.505
Let's see if I have enough
space to do it.

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:14.755
I should just clear
it every time.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.650
If all men in the Williams
family are over 6 feet tall--

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.880
that's not true of my family, of
the Khan family; maybe one

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.840
day if we eat right-- which
of the following

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.060
statements must be true?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.570
If all of the men in the
Williams' family are over 6

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.920
feet tall, which of
the following

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.490
statements must be true?

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.000
Choice A, no man under 6 foot
tall is a member of the

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.180
Williams family.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.650
Sure.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.610
That sounds good to me.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.700
Choice A, no man under 6 feet
tall is a member of the

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.850
Williams family.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.730
For example, I am 5 foot 9.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.210
If I was a member of the
Williams family, then the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.030
first statement could not be
have been said, that all men

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.795
in the Williams family
are over 6 feet tall.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.190
So that makes sense, all men
in the Williams family are

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.920
over 6 feet tall.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.750
So that means that no man under
6 foot tall is a member

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.010
of the Williams family, because
if there were then you

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.930
couldn't have said that all men
in the Williams family are

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.810
over 6 feet tall.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.880
That probably required the most
talking and the least

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.680
writing on my behalf,
but hopefully that's

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.000
a convincing answer.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.720
Problem 11.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.240
Let me know if it wasn't.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.410
What is the radius of a circle
that has circumference of pi.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.820
So we know that circumference
is equal 2 pi r.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.440
And they're telling us that
the circumference is pi.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.870
So pi is equal to 2 pi r.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.660
Divide both sides by 2
pi, you get pi over 2

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.980
pi is equal to radius.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.510
Divide the numerator and
the denominator by

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.550
pi, you get 1, 1.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.380
So you get 1/2 is equal to the
radius, and that is choice B.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.590
Pretty straightforward, eh?

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:05.270
Problem 12.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.950
If y is directly proportional
to x squared and y equals--

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.440
OK, so when I say directly
proportional, that means y is

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.975
equal to some constant, we don't
know what it is, y is

00:07:15.975 --> 00:07:18.620
equal to some constant
times x squared.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.150
That's what directly
proportional means.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.540
It means it's some constant
times x squared.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.740
y is directly proportional to
x squared, and y is equal to

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.690
1/8 when x is equal to 1/2.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:35.110
So y is equal to 1/8 is equal
to k times when x is 1/2.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.910
So when x is 1/2, that's
all we're saying.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.760
So what does this tell us?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.340
That means that 1/8 is
equal to k times 1/4.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:49.590
Multiply both sides by 4, times
4, you get 4/8 is equal

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.570
to k, because this
cancels out.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.890
And 4/8 is the same
thing as 1/2.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.880
So the relationship is, y is
equal to 1/2 x squared, and

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.720
now what are they asking us?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.200
What is the positive value of
x when y is equal to 9/2?

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.786
So they're saying when y equals
9/2, let's solve for x

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.150
in the positive value.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.130
9/2 is equal to 1/2 x squared.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.870
Multiply both sides by 2,
this 2 cancels here,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.006
this 2 cancels here.

00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:19.410
I was multiplying.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.090
So you get 9 is equal
to x squared.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.670
So they want the positive
value of x.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.320
So x is equal to plus
or minus 3.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.100
And they want the positive
value, so x is equal to

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.880
positive 3.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.260
And that's choice D.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.510
Choice D.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.120
Let me do the next problem
in the next video.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.789
I'll see you soon.
