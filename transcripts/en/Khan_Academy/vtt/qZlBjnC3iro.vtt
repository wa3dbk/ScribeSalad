00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:01.688
- [Voiceover] So in the
last couple of videos,

00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:03.523
I talked about the
multi-variable chain rule,

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:04.751
which I have up here, and if you

00:00:04.751 --> 00:00:06.628
haven't seen those go take a look.

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:09.063
Here and I want to write
it out in vector notation,

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:11.466
and this helps us generalize
it a little bit when

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.260
the intermediary space is a
little bit higher dimensional.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.944
So, instead of writing X of T and

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:21.211
Y of T as separate functions,
and just trying to emphasize

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.015
"oh they have the same input space, and

00:00:23.015 --> 00:00:25.869
whatever X takes in that's
the same number Y takes in."

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.444
It's better and a little bit cleaner

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:32.037
if we say there's a vector valued function

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:33.737
that takes in a single number "T,"

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:36.808
then it outputs some kind of vector.

00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:38.228
In this case you could say the components

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:41.895
of V are X of T and Y
of T, and that's fine.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.459
But I want to talk about
what this looks like

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:52.372
if we start writing
everything in vector notation,

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:56.566
and just since we see
DX/DT here and DY/DT here,

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.072
you might start thinking,
"oh we should take

00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:03.664
the derivative of that
vector valued function."

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:07.441
The derivative of V, with respect to T,

00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:09.120
and when we compute this
it's nothing more than

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.603
taking the derivatives of each component.

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:13.785
So in this case, the derivative of X,

00:01:13.785 --> 00:01:17.952
so you'd write DX/DT,
and the derivative of Y,

00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:23.418
DY/DT. This is the
vector value derivative.

00:01:25.182 --> 00:01:26.940
And now you might start
to notice something here.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.258
Okay so we've got one of
those components multiplied

00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:31.318
by a certain value and
another component multiplied

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:33.355
by a certain value, you might

00:01:33.355 --> 00:01:36.022
recognize this as a dot product.

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:39.129
This would be the dot product between the

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:41.005
vector that contains the derivatives,

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:45.172
the partial derivatives,
partial of F with respect to Y,

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.355
partial of F with respect to X, oh,

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:52.766
whoops, don't know why
I wrote it that way,

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:56.933
but up here that's with respect
to X, and then here to Y.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.261
So this whole thing, we're
taking the dot product

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.428
with the vector that contains
ordinary derivative DX/DT

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.711
and ordinary derivative DY/DT.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:16.653
And of course both of
these are special vectors,

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:19.667
they're not just random, the left one,

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:24.496
that's the gradient of F,
and the right vector here

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:25.755
that's what we just wrote that's

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:28.217
the derivative of V with respect to T,

00:02:28.217 --> 00:02:32.423
just for being quick I'm gonna
write that as V prime of T.

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.371
That's saying completely
the same thing as VDVT,

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.712
and this right here is
another way to write

00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:39.700
the multi-variable chain rule,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.349
and maybe if you were being
a little bit more exact

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.481
you would emphasize that when
you take the gradient of F

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:47.253
the thing that you input
into it is the output

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:48.771
of that vector valued function,

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.379
you know you're throwing
in X of T and Y of T,

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.895
so you might emphasize
that you take in that

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:57.054
as an input, and then
you multiply it by the

00:02:57.054 --> 00:03:01.221
derivative, the vector
valued derivative of V of T.

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.325
And when I say multiply,
I mean dot product, right,

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.317
these are vectors and you're
taking the dot product,

00:03:07.317 --> 00:03:09.646
it should seem very familiar to, you know,

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.790
the single-variable chain rule.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.823
And just to remind us
I'll throw it up here,

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:18.264
if you take the derivative
of composition of

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:21.347
two single-variable functions F of G,

00:03:23.872 --> 00:03:26.625
you take the derivative
of the outside F prime,

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:30.792
and throw in G, throw in what
was the interior function,

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:32.778
and you multiply it by the

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:36.568
derivative of that interior
function, G prime of T.

00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:38.331
And this is super helpful
in single-variable calculus

00:03:38.331 --> 00:03:40.437
for computing a lot of derivatives,

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:42.579
and over here it has a
very similar form right?

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.029
The gradient which really
serves the function

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.926
of the true extension
of the derivative for

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:50.736
multi-variable functions for
scalar valued multi-variable

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:53.543
functions at least. You
take that derivative

00:03:53.543 --> 00:03:56.428
and throw in the inner function,

00:03:56.428 --> 00:03:58.253
which just happens to be
a vector valued function.

00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:00.222
You throw it in there,
and then you multiply it

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:02.526
by the derivative of that,
but multiplying vectors

00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:06.487
in this context means taking
the dot product of the two,

00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:07.550
and this could mean if you have a function

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.191
with a whole bunch of different variables,

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:13.024
let's say you have some
F of X, or not F of X,

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:17.154
F of X1 and X2 and it takes in a

00:04:19.244 --> 00:04:23.411
whole bunch of variables
that it goes out to X100.

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.222
And then what you throw into
it is the vector value function

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:32.305
that's vector valued,
takes in a single variable,

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:36.343
and in order to be able to compose them

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:39.359
it's gonna have a whole bunch
of intermediary functions,

00:04:39.359 --> 00:04:43.312
and you can write it as X1, X2,
X3, all the way up to X100 ,

00:04:43.312 --> 00:04:45.289
and these are all functions at this point.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.036
These are component functions
of your vector valued V.

00:04:49.036 --> 00:04:51.175
This expression still makes sense, right?

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.130
You can still take the gradient of F,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.099
it's gonna have 100
components, you can plug

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.876
in any vector, any set
of 100 different numbers,

00:04:58.876 --> 00:05:00.819
and in particular the output of a

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.348
vector valued function with
100 different components

00:05:03.348 --> 00:05:05.153
is gonna work, and then
you take the dot product

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:07.801
with the derivative of
this. That's the more

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.284
general version of the
multi-variable chain rule,

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:13.005
and then the cool way
about writing it like this,

00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:16.902
you can interpret it in terms
of the directional derivative,

00:05:16.902 --> 00:05:19.012
and I think I'll do
that in the next video,

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:22.019
so, that's a certain way to interpret

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:24.309
this with a directional derivative.
