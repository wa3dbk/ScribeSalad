00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.500
We're on problem 55.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:15.050
If y is equal to 4 plus x minus
3 squared, then y is

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.140
lowest when x is equal to-- so
think about when will this

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.950
expression be the lowest
possible number?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.460
Well, if you think about this
whole term, right here, this x

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.770
minus 3 squared.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.350
Any number squared, if we're
dealing with real numbers, is

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.210
going to be a positive
number, right?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.170
So you could say that x minus
3 squared is going to be

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.920
greater than or equal
to 0, right?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.820
0 is kind of its
minimum point.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.080
So this whole value is going
to be as small as possible

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.700
when x minus 3 squared is as
small as possible, right?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.330
Because that's the variable
part of it.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.790
And this is going to be as small
as possible when x minus

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.470
3 is equal to 0.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.700
And when is x minus 3 going
to be equal to 0?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.440
We could write it out.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.110
When is x minus 3 equal to 0?

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.330
Well, add 3 to both sides.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.050
It's when x is equal to 3.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.840
So y is lowest when x minus
3 is equal to 0 or

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.350
x is equal to 3.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.850
And that's choice D.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.660
And all you have to recognize is
the lowest value that this

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.360
function can attain is when this
term goes to 0, because

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.720
otherwise it's a
positive term.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.700
It will only add to the 4.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.720
Next problem.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.000
56.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.720
Which of the following
is not equal to the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.990
square of an integer?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.120
So they say the square root
of the square root of 1.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.520
The square root of 1 is 1.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.380
And the square root of that
is going to be equal to 1.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.980
You could have said negative
1, but then that would have

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.170
been undefined.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.600
Fair enough.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
One of the roots of
the roots is 1.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.490
And this is the square
of an integer, right?

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.800
This is equal to 1 squared.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.930
2.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660
Square root of 4.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.800
Square root of 4,
that equals 2.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.680
Now is that the square
of an integer?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.870
No.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.600
That's equal to square root of 2
squared, but this clearly is

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.390
not an integer.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.180
Right?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.920
So the choice is 2.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.850
2 is not equal to the square
of an integer.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.570
We could look at
the other ones.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.800
18 divided by 2.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.070
Yes.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.510
9 is the square of 3.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.820
41 minus 25.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.820
That's 16.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.460
36.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.660
So all of the other ones are
squares of integers.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.190
That's a fairly

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.318
straightforward problem, I think.

00:02:25.318 --> 00:02:30.140
We're on problem 57.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.890
Fermat primes are prime numbers
that can be written in

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.890
the form 2 to the K plus 1,
where K is an integer and a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.140
power of 2.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.800
Which of the following is
not a Fermat prime?

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.210
So A, 3.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.445
Well 3 is equal to what?

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:04.050
It's equal to 2 to
the 1 plus 1.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.270
Right?

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.750
And in this case K is 1,
which is a power of 2.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.880
That's 2 to the 0.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.180
B is 5.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.100
Well, 5 is what?

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.030
That equals 2 squared plus 1.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.800
4 plus 1.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.020
And this is definitely
a power of 2.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.190
2 is a power of 2.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.600
2

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.180
to the 1st. C.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.850
17.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.640
That's 2 to the 4th plus 1.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.900
Right?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.350
2 to the 4th is 16 plus
1 and 4 is 2 squared.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.530
So that's a power of 2.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.330
Choice D.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.120
31.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.710
The closest power, if we
subtract 1 from it.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.960
2 to something does not
equal 30, right?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.510
That would have to be true
if 2 to the K plus

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.720
1 is equal to 31.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.060
Then 2 to the K would
have to equal 30.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.250
And I can't think of an integer
where I take 2 to some

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.110
power and get 30.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.800
So the choice is D.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.120
D is not a Fermat prime.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.725
And if you wanted to make
sure that it's not E.

00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.400
E is 257.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.120
Well that's just 2 to
the 8th plus 1.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.570
2 to the 8th is 256.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.120
And that's 257.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.589
So the answer is D.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.720
58.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:37.440
If x squared is equal to 2y to
the third, and 2y is equal to

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.500
4, they want to know what x
squared plus y is equal to.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.730
OK, x squared plus y.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.900
Well, they tell us
that x squared is

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.055
equal to y to the third.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:53.320
So let's just substitute that.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.640
Right?

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.720
So then we get 2y to the third
plus y, using this information

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.170
and that information.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.810
And they tell us 2y
is equal to 4.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.360
Well, just divide both sides by
2, you get y is equal to 2.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.730
So let's substitute
that into this.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.500
What's 2 to the third power?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.300
Well, that's 8 plus 2.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.360
So I don't want to divide.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.800
So that equals 16 plus 2,
which is equal to 18.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.440
Which is choice E.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.180
Next problem.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.290
59.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:40.270
A glucose solution contains 15
grams of glucose per 100 cubic

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.690
centimeters of solution.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.120
If 45 cubic centimeters of the
solution were poured into an

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.770
empty container, how many grams
of glucose would be in

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.140
the container?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.090
So we can just set up a ratio.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.500
We have 15 grams per 100, so how
many grams are we going to

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.000
have per 45 centimeters cubed?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.230
How many grams, right?

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.550
So they still want to
know grams. All the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.150
units are the same.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.820
And so let's see if we
can cross multiply.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.950
We could say 15 times 45 is
equal to 100 times x.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:29.820
So 15 times 45 is
equal to 100x.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.140
And just to make the
math easy, let's

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.240
divide by some numbers.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.930
Let's divide both sides by 5.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.395
So then this becomes 20
and this becomes 9.

00:06:39.395 --> 00:06:42.420
We could divide both sides by 5
again and then this becomes

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.430
4 and this becomes 3.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.080
And now the numbers are
easy to deal with.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.750
3 times 9 is 27 is
equal to 4x.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.860
Divide both sides by 4.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.970
You get x is equal to 27/4.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.540
27/4 and 4 goes into 27.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.990
what is that?

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:10.590
That is equal to and 6 and 3/4,
and all their numbers are

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.160
in decimals, so that's 6.75.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.860
Which is E.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.080
Right?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.120
4 times 6 is 24, and you
have 3 left over.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.120
Right.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.150
Next problem.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:25.790
Problem 60.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.500
In the figure of P, Q, R,
S is a parallelogram.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.480
Let me draw this.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.680
This looks interesting.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.046
So I have to draw a
couple of lines.

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:37.480
That's one line.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.260
And they have another
line that looks

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.510
something like that.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.475
It's a parallelogram.

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:47.076
Let me connect the lines.

00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:48.570
It looks like that.

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:54.880
Let's see, this line actually
keeps going.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.880
Let me draw that in.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.330
They tell us, this is P.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.970
This is Q.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.000
This is R.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.165
And this is S.

00:08:04.165 --> 00:08:10.720
And they tell us that
this is 140 degrees.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.460
They tell us that this is 2y.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.730
And they tell us
that this is x.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.700
And then they say, in
the figure above,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.080
what is y minus x?

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.110
So since we know this is a
parallelogram, we know that

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.720
this line is parallel to this
line, and we know that this

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.910
line is parallel to that line.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.280
That actually tells us a lot of
information, especially if

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.770
we continue the lines over.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.000
Then everything we learned in
geometry about parallel lines

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.250
starts to hold.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.110
Let me draw it in a
different color.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.300
So if this line, in green, is
parallel to this line, then

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.940
you can view this line right
here as a bit of a

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.410
transversal.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.480
And 140 degrees and 2y are
corresponding angles.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.030
So they're actually going
to equal each other.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.840
And you can even eyeball it and
think about, well, that

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.320
make sense.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.970
Those lines are parallel.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.090
So 140 degrees is equal to 2y.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.630
y is equal to 70.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.880
Fair enough.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:12.400
And now let's consider-- let me
switch colors-- that this

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.510
line right here, this magenta
line and this magenta line,

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.860
those two are parallel.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.720
And we can now view this
as a transversal.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.700
Right?

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.730
If this is a transversal, then
the 70 degrees and this angle

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.370
are corresponding angles, so
they're going to be equal.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.600
So that's 70.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.910
And then this angle up here,
that 70 degrees that I just

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.160
drew, and the x angle, they're
supplementary, right?

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.670
They add up to 180.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.830
So you have x plus 70
is equal to 180.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:51.210
So you get x is equal
to 110 degrees.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:51.860
Oh, no, no, sorry.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.690
I made a mistake.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.100
I made a mistake.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.030
So this angle isn't 70.
y is equal to 70.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.450
But this angle is 2y, so
this is 140 degrees.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:00.810
Right?

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.800
We figured out that this is 140
degrees, so this has to be

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.230
140 degrees.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.020
And what my brain caught, I was
like, boy, that doesn't

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.360
look like 70 degrees.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.900
70 degrees would be
a lot narrower.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.990
That looks more like 140.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.720
But anyway, this is 140.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.640
So if this is 140, the
corresponding angle up here is

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.830
also going to be 140 degrees.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.550
And so, I did that wrong.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:26.210
x plus 140, right? x plus
this 140 degrees.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.260
The logic is still the same.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.570
They're supplementary.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:29.970
Equals 180.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.080
So x is equal to 40 degrees.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.520
And they wanted to know what?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.670
They wanted to know
what y minus x is.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:37.680
So that's 30.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.310
70 minus 40 is 30.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.030
And that's choice A.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.960
See you in the next video.
