00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.190
In this video I want to give
you an example of what it

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.170
means to fit data to a line.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.730
Instead of doing my traditional
video using my

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.840
little pen tablet, I'm going to
do it straight on Excel so

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.250
you could see how to do this for
yourself, so if you have

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.090
Excel or some other type of
a spreadsheet program.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.380
We're not going to go
into the math of it.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.540
I really just want you to get
the conceptual understanding

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.840
of what it means to fit data
with line, or do a linear

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.880
regression.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.550
So here, let's just
read the problem.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.550
The following table shows the
median California income--

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.190
remember median is the middle,
the middle California income

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
--from 1995 to 2002
as reported by

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.680
the U.S. Census Bureau.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.320
Draw a scatter plot and
find the equation.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.540
What would you expect the median
annual income of a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.370
California family to be
in the year 2010?

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970
What are the meanings of the
slope and the y-intercept of

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.580
this problem?

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.050
So the first thing you'd want
to do-- I just copied and

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.060
pasted this image --we have to
get the data in a form that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.920
the spreadsheet can
understand it.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.830
So let's make some
tables here.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.800
Let's say years since 1995.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.710
Let's make that one column.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670
Let me make this a
little bit wider.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.670
Then let me put median income.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.100
This is the median income in
California for a family.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.560
So we start off with 1 year,
or 0 years since

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.100
1995, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.710
Actually if you want, it'll
figure out the trend if you

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.590
just keep going down.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.650
It'll figure out you're just
incrementing by 1.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.340
Then the income, I'll
just copy in these

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.300
numbers right there.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:54.710
So that's $53,807, $55,217,
$55,209, $55,415 $63,100,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:08.680
$63,206, $63,761, and then
we have $65,766.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.520
So I don't need these
over here.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.380
So I'm going to get
rid of them.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.810
I can clear them.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.180
So let me make sure I
have enough entries.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.040
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.570
6, 7, 8 entries.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.930
I want to make sure I got my
data right. $53,807, $55,217,

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.510
$55,209, 415, 100,
206, 761, 766.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.040
OK, there we go.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.880
Now you're going to find that
in Excel this is incredibly

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.080
easy if you know what
to click on.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.430
One, plot this data, create a
scatter plot, and then even

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220
better, create a regression
of that data.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.970
So all you have to do is
you select the data.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.480
Then you go to insert,
and I'm going to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.170
insert a scatter plot.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.390
Then you can pick the different

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.160
types of scatter plots.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.820
I just want to plot the data.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.670
There you go.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.470
It plotted the data for me.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.050
There you go.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.320
If you go by this is the actual
income, and this is by

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.870
year since 1995.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.570
So this is 1995.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.710
It was $53,807.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.370
In 1996 it's $55,217.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.250
So it plotted all the data.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.110
Now what I want to
do is fit a line.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.000
So this isn't exactly a line.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.580
But let's see, if we assume
that a line can model this

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.500
data well, I'm going to get
Excel to fit a line for me.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.580
So what I can do is I have all
of these options up here for

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.720
different ways to fit
a line, all of

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.710
these different options.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.780
I'm going to pick
this one here.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.940
You might not be
able to see it.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.460
It looks like it has a
line between dots.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.450
It also has fx which tells me
going to tell me the equation

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.470
of the line.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.520
So if I click on that,
there you go.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.570
It not only fit, it replotted
that same data

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.530
on a different graph.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.830
Let me make it a little
bit bigger.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.930
No, I don't want to that.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.060
Let me make it a little
bit bigger.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.430
We can cover up the data now,
just because I think we know

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.410
what's going on.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.460
So let me cover it up
right like that.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.620
So not only did it plot the
various data points, it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.029
actually fit a line to that
data and it gave me the

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.355
equation of that line.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.975
Let me see if I can make this
a little bit bigger.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.910
I'll move it out of the way so
you can read it at least.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.400
So it tells me right here, that
the equation for this

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.400
line is y is equal to 1,882.3x
plus 52,847.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.250
So if you remember what we
know about slope and

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.660
y-intercept, the y-intercept
is 52,847, which is, if you

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.000
use this line as your measure,
where this line intersects at

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.470
year 0, or in 1995.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.830
So if you use this line as a
model, in 1995 the line would

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
say that you're going
to make $52,847.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.280
The actual data was a little
bit off of that.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.970
It was a little bit
higher, $53,807.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.250
So it was a little bit higher.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.850
But we're trying to get a line
that gets as close as possible

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.980
to all of this data.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.530
It's actually trying to minimize
the distance, the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.470
square of the distance, between
each of these points

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.970
in the line.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.440
We won't go into
the math there.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.830
But it gave us this
nice equation.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.810
Now we can use this nice
equation to predict things.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.290
If we say that this is a good a
model for the data-- let me

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.400
bring this down a little
bit --let's try

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400
to answer our question.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.210
So we drew a scatter plot--
really Excel did it for us.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.000
We found the equation
right there.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.060
They say, what would you expect
the median annual

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.490
income of a California family
to be in the year 2010?

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.010
So here, we can just use the
equation they gave us.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770
This right here, was 2002.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.850
So I could write
down the year.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.240
This was the year of 2002.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.490
So the year 2010 is
8 more years.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.350
Let me make a little
column here.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.540
So this is the year,
1995, 1996.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.710
Then Excel will be able to
figure out if I select those,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.950
and I go to this little bottom
right square and I scroll

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.920
down, Excel will actually figure
out that I want to

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.980
increment by 1 year
every time.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.670
If I say years since 1995, once
again I can just continue

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.550
this trend right here.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.600
So 2010 would be 15 years.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.660
So we can just apply
this equation.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.760
We could say it's going to be
equal to, according to this

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.570
line-- I'm just going to type it
in, hopefully you can read

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.000
what I'm saying --1,882.3
times x.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.500
x here is the year since 1995.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.430
I could just select this
cell, or I could type

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.320
in the number 15.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.590
That means times this
cell, times 15.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:11.390
Then plus 52,847, plus
that right there.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:17.600
Click enter and it predicts
$81,081.50.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.610
So if you just continue this
line for another 8 or so

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.550
years, it predicts that the
median income in California

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.730
for a family will be $81,000.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.270
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.340
Spreadsheets are very useful
tools for manipulating data.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.520
It'll give you a sense of why
linear models are interesting,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.130
why lines are interesting, and
how you can actually use these

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.600
tools to interpret data and
maybe even extrapolate some

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.370
type of a prediction.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.450
This right here, is an
extrapolation using this

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.260
linear regression.
