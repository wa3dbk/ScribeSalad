00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's explore what happens to
determinants when you multiply

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.675
them by a scalar.

00:00:04.675 --> 00:00:08.210
So let's say we wanted to find
the determinant of this

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.730
matrix, of a, b, c, d.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.820
By definition the determinant
here is going to be equal to a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.360
times d minus b times c, or
c times b, either way.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.810
ad minus bc.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.830
That's the determinant
right there.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.290
Now what if we were
to multiply one of

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.590
these rows by a scalar.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.940
Let's say we multiply it by k.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.880
So we have the situation a, b.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.720
Let's multiply the second
row times k.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.870
So we kc and kd.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350
Now what's the determinant
going to look like?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.840
We're going to have a times
kd, or we could just write

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.410
that as kad, minus kc times b,
or we could right that as kbc.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.000
If we factor out the k,
we get that equals k

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.690
times ad minus bc.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.000
Now you immediately see that
this thing is the same thing

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.100
as this thing.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.930
So this is equal to k times the
determinant of a, b, c, d.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.910
So when you just multiply a
row by a scalar-- just one

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.470
row, not the entire matrix--
when you just multiply a row

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.770
by some scalar, the resulting
determinant will be the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.550
original determinant
times that scalar.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.880
Now you might say well what
happens if I multiply the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580
whole matrix times
that scalar.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.040
Well that's equivalent to
multiplying by a scalar twice.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.120
Let's say I have the matrix A,
and the matrix A is equal to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.830
a, b, c, d.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.190
If I were to think about the
matrix kA, now I'm not just

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.270
multiplying one row.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.210
I'm multiplying the whole
matrix by a scalar.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.500
This is going to be equal
to ka, kb, kc, and kd.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180
When you figure out its
determinant, the determinant

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.040
of k times A is going to be
equal to the determinant of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.880
ka, kb, kc, and kd.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.020
Here you're immediately going
to end up with k squared

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.790
terms. You're going to have
k squared times ad.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.770
It's going to be equal to k
squared ad minus k squared bc,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.030
or k squared times ad minus
bc, or k squared times the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080
determinant of just A.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.280
So you have to be
very careful.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.990
This is only for a
two by two case.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.140
You'll find out if this was an
n by n matrix that this would

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.190
have been k to the n.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.600
So the take away is the only way
you can say that this is

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.430
going to be some scalar multiple
times your original

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.890
determinant, is only if you
multiply one row times that

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.810
scalar multiple, not
the whole matrix.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.030
Let's see how this extends
to maybe a 3 by 3 case.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.370
You might say, hey Sal, you just
picked the second row.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.800
Does it work with
the first row?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.140
I'll leave that for you to
determine, but it does.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.940
It does work.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.500
It doesn't matter which row
I multiplied it by.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.450
Let's take the three
by three case.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.600
Let's say we have some matrix.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.020
Let's call this A again.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.600
I'm redefining A.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.300
It's going to be a, b,
c, d, e, f, g, h, i.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.370
Then if you take its
determinant, the determinant

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.100
of A is going to be equal to--
we can do it a couple of

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.560
different ways.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.870
But I'll just pick some
arbitrary row.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.670
Because that's the row that
we're going to multiply by

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.410
some scalar.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.260
So let's just take that
row right there.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.590
Remember the plus
minus pattern.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.540
Remember plus, minus, plus,
minus, plus, minus, plus,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.630
minus, plus, that little
checkerboard pattern.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.590
So d is a minus right there.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.910
So it's going to be equal to
minus d times the determinant

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.500
of its submatrix.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.340
So you cross out that
column in that row.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.020
It's b, c, h, i.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.986
It's going to be plus e times
its submatrix a, c, g, i.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.030
It's going to be minus f times--
you get rid of that

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.970
row in that column--
d, e, g, h, the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.920
determinant of d, e, g, h.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.230
That's the determinant
of this matrix A.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.340
Now what if we define some
new matrix here?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.450
Let's call it A prime.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.180
Let me make this scroll
down a little bit.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.720
Let me define A prime
right here.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.010
A prime, I'm just going to
multiply this row by a scalar.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.590
So it's going to be equal to
a, b, c, kd, ke, and kf.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.640
I'm not multiplying the whole
matrix times the scalar.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.540
I can't say this is kA.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.540
I'm just multiplying
one of its rows.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.960
Then I have g, h, and i.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.400
So what's the determinant
of A prime going to be?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.340
I put that prime there.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.650
So it's different than A,
but it's derived from A.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.380
I just multiplied one row
of A times the scalar.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.810
Well I can go along that same
row that I did up here.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.580
I can go along that same row.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.230
The only difference is is that
instead of having a d,

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.530
I now have a kd.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.870
Instead of an e, I
now have a ke.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.990
So instead of a d, I'm going
to have a kd there.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.300
Instead of an e, I'm going
to have an ke there.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.260
So it's going to be this exact
same thing, but I can replace

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.160
this guy, this guy, and this guy
with them multiplied by k.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.070
So it's going to be equal to
minus kd times the determinant

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.650
of the submatrix b, c, h, i--
I'm not even look over here

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.420
because it's going to be the
same thing as that one up

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:55.060
there-- plus ke times the
determinant of a, c, g, i,

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.360
minus kf times the determinant
of d, e, g, h.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.800
What is this equal to?

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.980
This is equal to, if you just
factor out the k, it's equal

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.220
to k times this.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.680
So it's equal to k times
the determinant of A.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.150
So our result also worked
for three by three case.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.650
I just happened to pick
the middle row.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.780
But I encourage you
to pick other rows

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.030
and to see what happens.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.470
So let's actually do it
for the general case.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.240
Because I've just been giving
you particular examples, and I

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.500
like to show you the general
proof when the general proof

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.920
isn't too harry.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.410
So let's say I have
an n by n matrix.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.670
Let's say that I
have matrix A.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.530
Let's say that A is n by n.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.940
You can write it like this.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.090
This is the first row.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.140
This is the first column a11,
a12, all the way to a1n.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.860
I'm going to pick some arbitrary
row here that I'm

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.640
going to end up multiplying
by a scalar.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.550
So we can go down here.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:07:03.300
Let's say row ai, so this is
ai1, ai2, all the way to ain.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.610
This is some row that I'm going
to use to determine the

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.060
determinant.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.600
Remember we can go to any row
to get the determinant.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.180
Then finally you keep going.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:18.860
You get an1, an2, all
the way to ann.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.860
This is as general as you can
get for an n by n matrix.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.000
Now let's figure out its
determinant, so the

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.650
determinant of A.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.200
I'm just going to go down
this row right there.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:40.560
So the determinant of
A is equal to what?

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.750
Well we have to remember the
checkerboard pattern.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.170
We don't know where we are on
the checkerboard pattern

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.110
because I just picked an
arbitrary general row here.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.290
But we can use the general
formula that the sign is going

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:56.270
to be determined by negative 1
to the i-- I don't know if i

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.390
is even or odd-- so it's
going to be i plus

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.110
for this term 1 power.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.920
That's it's sign.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.110
This is what gives us the
checkerboard pattern.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:05.190
Let me make that clear.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.260
It looks complicated, but this
is just a checkerboard.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.420
Times this term right there,
so times ai, so the

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.720
coefficient, ai1, and then times
this guy's submatrix.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.730
You remember the submatrix.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.700
You get rid of this row, and
this column is going to be

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.430
everything that's left over.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.960
So times that submatrix
of ai1.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:40.730
Then it's going to be plus-- we
just keep doing it-- plus

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:46.360
negative 1 to the i plus
2 times ai2 times its

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:53.300
submatrix-- all the way, you
just keep going-- plus minus 1

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.380
to the i plus n times ai.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.170
You're in the nth column,
and then its submatrix.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.960
This is going to be an n minus
1 by n minus 1 matrix.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.990
All of these are going to be.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.520
Just like that, that's
the determinant of A.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.940
We could actually rewrite
it in sigma notation.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.890
That'll simplify things
a little bit.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:18.720
So the determinant of A, we can
rewrite it as the sum from

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.600
j is equal to 1 to j-- I'll
write it explicitly here-- j

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:36.800
is equal to n of negative 1 to
the i plus j times aij, and

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.440
then each of the submatrices,
Aij.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:47.740
This thing right here is just
another way of writing this

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.990
thing I wrote up there.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.790
I'm just saying the sum.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.500
You just take j equal 1,
put them in there.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.760
You get this term right there.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.830
You take j equal
2, you add it.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.660
You get this term right there.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.380
You keep doing it.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.480
You get j equal n.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.070
You get that term right there.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.800
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.520
So what happens I have
some new matrix?

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.370
Let me copy and paste
my current matrix.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.210
So let me copy and paste it.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.950
Actually let me copy and
paste everything.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.340
That'll make things
move quickly.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.410
I copied it.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.010
Now let me paste it
just like that.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:28.940
Let me define a new
matrix A prime.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.420
It's still an n by n matrix.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.240
But that row that I just
happened to use to determine

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.500
my determinant, I'm going to
multiply it by a scalar k.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.740
So it's k ai1, k ai2 k
ain just like that.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.580
So what's the determinate
of A prime?

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.090
Well we're just going to
go down this row again.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.200
But now instead of just an ai1,
we have a k ai1 Instead

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.970
of an ai2, we have a
k ai2 Instead of an

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.530
ain we have a k ain.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.830
So it's determinant is just
going to be this same thing,

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.375
but instead of an aij
everywhere, we're going to

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:06.540
have a k aij.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.203
So this is the determinant
of A prime.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.180
We could just take out this
constant right here.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.100
It has no i's or j's in it.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.310
I has no j's in it in
particular, so we can just

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.270
take it out.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:26.100
So it's equal to k times the sum
from j is equal to 1 to j

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:34.080
is equal to n of minus 1 to
the i plus j times aij.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.710
This is the coefficient.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.040
This is the submatrix for each
of those coefficients, aij.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.170
That's a matrix right
there, an n minus 1

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.310
by n minus 1 matrix.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.550
Then you immediately recognize--
I think you saw

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.580
where this was going-- this
right here is just the

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.820
determinant of A.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.430
So we get the result that the
determinant of A prime is

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.890
equal to k times the
determinant of A.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.535
So we've just shown you in
general, if you have any n by

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:10.680
n matrix, if you multiply only
one row, not the whole matrix,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.900
only one row by some scalar
multiple k, the resulting

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.440
determinant will be your
original determinant times k.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.060
Now I touched on this in
the original video.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.810
What is the determinant
of k times A?

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.400
So now we're multiplying
every row times k.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.940
Or another way to think about
is you're multiplying

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.500
n rows times k.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.810
So you're doing this n times.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.880
So if you multiply
k times itself n

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.930
times, what do you get?

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.010
You get k to the n.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:53.090
So this is going to be equal
to k to the n times the

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.560
determinant of A.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.750
If you just do it once,
you get k times the

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.460
determinant of A.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.650
Now if you do a second row,
you're going to get k times k

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.715
times the determinant of A.

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:03.730
If you do a third row, you're
going to get k to the third

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.010
times the determinant of A.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.040
The fourth row, k to the
fourth times the

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.900
determinant of A.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.386
If you do them all, all n rows,
you're going to have k

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:11.480
to the n times the
determinant of A.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.140
Anyway, hopefully you found
that interesting.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.970
I encourage you to experiment
with these other ways.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.390
Try going down a column and
seeing what happens.
