00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.890
We have this system of
equations, y is equal to 4x

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.440
minus 17.5, and y plus
2x is equal to 6.5.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.150
And we have to solve
for x and y.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.950
So we're looking for x's
and y's that satisfy

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.460
both of these equations.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.940
Now, the easiest way to think
about it is we've already

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.750
solved for y in this
top equation.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.600
Let me write it again.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.800
I'll write it in pink.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.790
We have y is equal
to 4x minus 17.5.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.190
So this first equation is
telling us, literally, by this

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.720
constraint, y should be
4 times x minus 17.5.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.940
Now, the second equation says
whatever y is, we had 2 times

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.070
x, and that should be 6.5.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.760
Well, the y here also has to
meet this constraint up here.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.420
It also has to meet the
constraint that it has to be 4

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.530
times x minus 17.5.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.390
So what we can do is, is we can
substitute this value for

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.720
y into this equation.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.870
Let me be clear what
I'm doing.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.180
The second equation here is
y plus 2x is equal to 6.5.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.600
We know that y has to be equal
to this thing right here. y

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.870
has to be equal to
4x minus 17.5.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.790
So let's take 4x minus 17.5,
and substitute y with that.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.320
So let's put that right there.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.240
So if we were to do that, if we
were to replace this y with

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.940
4x minus 17.5, because that's
what the first equation is

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.340
telling us, then we get
4x minus 17.5, plus

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.810
2x is equal to 6.5.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.490
And now we have a single linear

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.860
equation with one unknown.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440
Let's solve for x.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.130
So first we have our x
terms. We have a 4x,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.320
and we have a 2x.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.210
We can group them or
add them together.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.400
4x plus 2x is 6x.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:03.510
And then we have 6x minus
17.5 is equal to 6.5.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.630
Then we can get the 17.5 out
of the way by adding it to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.850
both sides of the equation.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.020
So this is negative 17.5, so
let's add positive 17.5 to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.390
both sides of this equation.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.560
And we are left with the
left-hand side is just going

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.020
to be 6x, because these
guys cancel out.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.480
6x is going to be equal to--
and 6.5-- see, 6 plus 17 is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.010
23, and then 0.5
plus 0.5 is 1.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.180
So this is going to be 24.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.670
And then we can divide both
sides of this equation by 6.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.250
And you are left with x is equal
to 24 over 6, which is

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.720
the same thing as 4.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.480
So we figured out the x value
for the x and y pair that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.030
satisfy both of these
equations.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.860
Now we need to figure
out the y value.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.930
And we can do that by taking
this x and putting it back

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.180
into one of these equations.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.320
We can do it in to either one.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.965
We should get the
same y value.

00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:01.450
So let's just do this
top one up here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.270
So if we assume x is equal to 4,
this top equation tells us

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:15.420
y is equal to 4 times x, which
in this case is 4, minus 17.5.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.830
Well, this is equal to 16 minus
17.5, which is equal to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.610
negative 1.5.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.880
So y is equal to negative 1.5.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.820
So the solution to this system
is x is equal to 4, y is equal

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.620
to negative 1.5.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.540
And you can even verify that
these two, they definitely

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.040
work for the top one if you put
4 times 4, minus 17.5, you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.320
get negative 1.5.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.180
But they also work for
the second one.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.290
And let's do that.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.900
In the second one, if you take
negative 1.5, plus 2 times x--

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.070
plus 2 times 4-- what
does that equal?

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.590
That's negative 1.5 plus 8.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.740
Well, negative 1.5
plus 8 is 6.5.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.970
So this x and y satisfy both
of these equations.
