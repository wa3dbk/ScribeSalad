00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.840
A ticket agent sells 42
tickets to a play.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
The tickets cost $29 each.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.600
Use rounding to estimate the
total dollars taken in from

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.320
the sale of the tickets.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.950
Now if we wanted the exact
number, we could say 42 times

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.710
29, and we could work out the
multiplication, but they

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.430
essentially want us to be able
to do it in our head.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.310
We want to round the numbers
first and then multiply.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.160
So if we want to round, and
really we just have two places

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.670
here, so if we're going to round
anything, it's going to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.130
be to the nearest ten because
that's the largest place we

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.670
have. So if we round 42 to the
nearest ten-- we've done this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.680
drill many times-- 2 in the ones
place is the less than 5,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.030
so we're going to round down.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.540
The nearest ten is 40.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.050
We're going to round
down to 40.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.940
29, if we round to the nearest
ten, 9 in the ones place is

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.670
greater than or equal to
5, so we round up.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.100
The nearest ten is 30.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.240
And another way to
think about it.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.990
Just say, well, you know, 42,
that's pretty close to 40.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.870
29 is pretty close to 30.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.450
Those are literally the nearest
multiples of ten that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.520
I can figure out, so
now I can multiply.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.900
And here, once again, we can
use-- you could call it a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.540
trick, but hopefully, you
understand why it works.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.830
But 30 times 40, instead of
you saying, well, this is

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.050
going to be the same thing as 3
times 4, but we're going to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.290
put two zeroes at
the end of it.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.180
30 times 40 is the same thing as
3 times 4 with two zeroes,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.860
so let's do that.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.650
So you have 3 times 4 is 12,
which we know, and then we

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.340
have two zeroes.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.820
We got that zero, so let's stick
that zero there, and

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.760
then we got that blue
zero there, so let's

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.080
put that over there.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.080
So they're going to have roughly
$1,200 taken it from

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.400
sales of the tickets.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.510
That is our estimate.
