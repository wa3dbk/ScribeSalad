00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's see if we could do a
couple more of these conic

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.420
section identification
problems.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.870
So I have this problem, x
squared plus y squared minus

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.990
2x plus 4y is equal to 4.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.990
And so, the first thing I like
to do is just try to figure

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.340
out what type of conic
section this will be.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.265
And we have our -- this
is my x squared term,

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:29.200
my y squared term.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.440
They're on the same
side of the equation.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.590
And they both have
positive coefficients.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.280
So this tells me that
we're going to be

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.055
dealing with an ellipse.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.320
And in this case in particular,
the coefficients are

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.930
the same number.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.230
They're both positive 1.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.350
So this is going to tell
me that this is a circle.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.360
So let's get this in
the standard form.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.350
And try to graph the circle.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.100
So we're going to want
to complete the square.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.480
So let's take the x terms,
since we get x squared minus

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.490
2x plus something to complete
the square later on.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.960
Plus, and now let's do
the y squared terms.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:11.760
y squared plus 4y plus
something is equal to 4.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.730
And now what are we at here?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.860
We take 1/2 of the
minus 2, minus 1.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.650
Square it.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.780
That becomes plus 1.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.730
Add a 1.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.260
We have nothing out here, so we
really just added a 1 to the

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.580
left-hand side of
this equation.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.370
So we have to add 1 to
the right-hand side.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.310
And here we take 1/2 of 4.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.240
1/2 of 4 is 2.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.950
2 squared is 4.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.040
Put a 4 here.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.420
So you have to add a 4 to the
right-hand side as well.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.640
And we actually did add just a
4, because there was nothing

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.790
multiplying the 4 out here.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:53.680
And so this becomes x minus 1
squared plus y plus 2 squared

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.070
is equal to 4 plus 1
plus 4 is equal to 9.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.660
And there you have it.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.070
We have it in the standard
form of a circle.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.690
You remember that if a circle
is centered at 0, the standard

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.830
form would be x squared plus y
squared is equal to r squared.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.860
So this is r squared, this
is the radius squared.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.510
So that tells us the radius
of the circle is 3.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.330
And it was just shifted so that
its origin, instead of being 0,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
0, is at the point 1, minus 2.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.440
And the reason why we got 1,
minus 2, we just have to

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.410
think about what makes this
whole expression equal 0?

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.960
In this case it was the origin.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.120
In this case, it's x equals 1.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.230
And what makes this whole
expression equal 0, in this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.620
case, it was y is equal to 0.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.950
In this case it's y
is equal to minus 2.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.380
So that's our center.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.700
That's our radius, and we're
ready to graph this circle.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.610
So it's at, let me see.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.110
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.340
I should graph the
circle first.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.080
That's fair enough.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.870
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.406
So it's going to
be at 1, minus 2.

00:03:01.406 --> 00:03:03.280
So, 1, minus 2.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.290
So it's going to be down here.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.945
So it's going to come out, this
circle's going to start there.

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:19.290
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.290
It's going to be at 1,
and then you go 1, 2.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.970
So that's pretty
close to the center.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.995
Maybe I should do it at 1, 2.

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:28.410
So that's at center.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.550
Right there, at 1, minus 2.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.860
And then its radius is 3.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.870
So this distance right here
is 3, in any direction.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.820
3.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.050
And that is 3.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.940
Fair enough, that was a pretty
straightforward problem.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.080
Circles in some ways
are the simplest.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.430
And remember I said it's
going to be an ellipse.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.870
And you say, oh, this isn't
the standard formula

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.820
for an ellipse.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.630
So just as a refresher, if you
divide both sides of this

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.470
equation by 9, what do you get?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:57.180
You get x minus 1 squared
over 9 plus y plus 2 squared

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.430
over 9 is equal to 1.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.660
And then you see that the
horizontal axis, I guess.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.190
Or the horizontal diameter,
is going to be 3.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.810
Or the horizontal radius
is going to be 3.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.260
And the vertical radius
is also going to be 3.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.730
Because the radius never
changes in this ellipse.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.450
Which is really a circle.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.790
Let's do one more.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.600
Just to make sure you
know this stuff cold.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:33.660
So I have 2x squared plus y
plus 12x plus 16 is equal to 0.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.080
Let's look at the x squared
and the y squared terms.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.380
0's an squared term.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.340
But I don't see a
y squared term.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.170
So this is a bit
of a conundrum.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.440
And this will lead us to the
fourth of our conic sections,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.150
which I talk about in the
first video but we haven't

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.950
really touched on yet.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.350
And that's the parabola.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.280
And how do I know
it's a parabola?

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.210
You're familiar, and I'll go
more in future videos on all

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.190
the different ways that
a parabola comes about.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.090
And how all the points are
equidistant between one point

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.330
and a line and all of that.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.550
But just in very simple ways,
you recognize the most

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.500
simple parabola is y
is equal to x squared.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.990
That parabola looks
something like this.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.940
Where its minimum point, or
its vertex, is at the origin.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.950
Or if you have a parabola like,
x is equal to y squared.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.660
That looks something like this.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.410
Where it's a sideways
version of that one.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.000
Where, once again, its
vertex is at the origin.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.660
And just out of interest, so we
know that this is a parabola,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.790
because we have a y and we
have an x squared, right?

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.610
They're different degrees.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.870
There's no second
degree term of the y.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.485
And just to put this in a form
that's familiar to you, let's

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:50.540
just subtract everything but
the y from the left-hand side.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:58.760
So you get y is equal to minus
2x squared minus 12x minus 16.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.890
And this is kind of the
traditional form that

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.660
you're familiar with.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.360
You're probably even used to
finding the 0'z of this

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.840
parabola, and we could
do that right now.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.720
We could say, OK, when
does this equation

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.480
intersect the x axis.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.850
The x axis is when
y is equal to 0.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.930
So that equals 0.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.490
You get minus 2x squared
minus 12x minus 16.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.820
And this is different to
what we normally do.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.460
Normally I would immediately
break into completing

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.730
the square.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.740
But I just want to figure out
the 0's of this parabola first.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.720
So this 0's equal to minus 2
times factoring out minus 2,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.110
you get x plus 6x plus 8.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.470
So the 0 is equal to minus 2
times x plus 2 times x plus

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.420
4, I just factored that.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.770
And so for this whole thing
to be 0, either this

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.260
is 0 or that is 0.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.710
And so, either x plus
2 is equal to 0, or x

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.620
plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.180
So x is equal to minus 2,
and x is equal to minus 4.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.530
That's the two 0's
of this parabola.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.180
So we immediately know one
thing about this parabola, and

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.130
you've probably already done
this in your algebra classes.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:14.350
If we were to draw the x axis,
it intersects the x axis at 1

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.260
and minus 2, and 3 and minus 4.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.170
That's all we know
about this right now.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.510
So let's see if we can use some
of our completing the square

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.710
skills with the conic sections
we've done so far, to to come

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.180
up with a little bit more
information about

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.220
this parabola.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.850
So let's try to complete
the square with it.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:31.920
I'll rewrite it down here.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.330
So it's y is equal to, this
is the one I'm dealing with.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.680
Now, let me just take the x
terms by themselves, and

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.430
factor out the minus 2.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.970
Minus 2 times x
squared plus 6x.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.240
And I'm going to add
something else.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.130
And then I have a
minus 16 over there.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.730
To make this a perfect square,
I have to take 1/2 of

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.000
this, 1/2 of the 6.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.920
1/2 of the 6 is 3.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.090
3 squared is 9.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:05.400
If I add nine to the right-hand
side of the equation, remember,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.350
I didn't just add 9.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.830
This is 9 times
minus 2 I'm adding.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.280
So if I subtract, that's minus
18, if I subtract 18 from the

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.825
right-hand side, I also have to
do it from the left-hand side.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.720
So, subtract 18 there.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.650
And now my equation becomes y
minus 18 is equal to minus

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.500
2 times, what is this?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.740
This is x plus 3
squared minus 16.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.230
And let's just get it in a form
that we might start recognizing

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.990
from our conic sections.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.260
Let's add 16 to both sides.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.070
If we add 16 to both sides,
y minus 18, plus 16.

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.310
It's going to be y minus
2, I'll put parentheses

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.810
around that.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:51.470
Is equal to minus 2
times x plus 3 squared.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.860
And you might wonder why
I put it in this form.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.850
And I did because this'll help
us, this is kind of the same

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.830
pattern that you see with all
of the other conic sections.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.180
Like, if I were to tell you to
graph y is equal to x squared,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.110
y is equal to x squared.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.630
It would look something like,
let me draw the - whoops -

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.790
Draw some axes here.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.170
y equals x squared looks
something like this.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.370
It looks like a parabola.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.540
I mean, it is a parabola,
with the vertex at 0,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.630
or its minimum point.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.800
And that's what the vertex is,
is the minimum point of, or the

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.310
maximum point of the parabola.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.020
We'll talk more about that,
you'll learn a lot more about

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.570
that when we go into calculus.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.090
But I think you can recognize
it, the bottom of the

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.860
U or the top of the U.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:39.540
If I were to draw y is equal
to minus x squared, you

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.490
could plot some points.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.160
But it looks
something like that.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.120
If I were to try to graph y is
equal to 2x squared, it would

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.220
just be like the y is equal to
x squared, but it would

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.370
go up twice as fast.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.010
It would look
something like that.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.330
So the vertex at the origin.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.480
And finally, if I were to
graph y is equal to minus

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.150
2x squared, it would look
something like this.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.120
It would open downward and it
would go down twice as fast.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.590
Now, this one, this equation
that we ended up with, right

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.640
here, this is the same thing as
y is equal to minus 2x squared.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.200
It has the same general shape.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.130
But instead of its vertex, or
its center or its starting

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.780
point, or whatever you want
to call it, to be at the

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.810
origin, it's shifted now.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.675
You say what y value makes
this term zero, well,

00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:31.470
y is equal to 2.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.890
Just why, in this case,
what y value makes this 0?

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.000
Well, it's 0 here because
we were at the origin.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.690
And here, what x
value makes this 0?

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.920
It's x is equal to minus 3.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.800
So this gives us information
about where the vertex is.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.620
It's at x is equal to
minus 3, y is equal to 2.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.190
So it's at x is equal to 1,
2, 3. y is equal to 1, 2.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.080
Right there.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.650
We already know those two
points, because we've

00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.480
figure out it's 0.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.810
But even if we didn't know
those two points -- we know

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.920
that this has the same
general shape as y is

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.770
equal to minus 2x squared.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.620
So it's going to open downward.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.330
Like this.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.660
And a little bit faster than y
is equal to minus x squared.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.020
So it's going to
look like this.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.150
And we know it goes through
that point and we know it

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.590
goes through that point.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.730
There you go.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.970
So we've touched on
every conic section.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.720
And in the next two videos,
I'll go into a little bit more

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.830
depth of the theory behind
conic sections and how they

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.140
came about and all of that.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:29.990
But I think now you're ready
to tackle a lot of what you

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.500
might actually see on
your algebra test.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.002
See you soon.
