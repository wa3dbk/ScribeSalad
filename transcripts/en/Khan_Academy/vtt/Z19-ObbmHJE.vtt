00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.170
In the last video we started
off with two linear

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.070
transformations.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.610
We had the linear transformation
s that was a

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.970
mapping from Rn to Rm.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.290
And then we had the linear
transformation t, that was

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.770
also a mapping from Rn to Rm.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.170
And we defined the idea of
the addition of these two

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.010
transformations.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.090
So s plus t, this transformation
of x we defined

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.560
as being equal to s of x,
this vector plus t of x.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.530
And of course, this input is
still from Rn, and then each

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.130
of these are vectors in Rm.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.300
If we add two vectors in Rm to
each other, we get another

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.610
vector in Rm because Rm
is a valid subspace.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.570
It's also closed
under addition.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.780
So this is still a mapping.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:07.600
So s plus t is still a mapping
from Rn to Rm.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.970
And we also said that every
linear transformation we've

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.050
shown in a previous video, can
be represented as a matrix.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.640
We could say that s of
x is equal to some

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120
matrix a times x.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.590
And we could also say that
t of x is equal to some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.690
matrix b times x.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.270
And both of these would
be m by n matrices.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.800
And let me write that m
by n, both of these.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.085
Because these are both mappings
from Rn to Rm.

00:01:38.085 --> 00:01:41.680
And what we did is we made
a another definition.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.370
This was a definition right here
and then we made another

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.820
definition.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.720
We defined the addition
of two matrices.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.950
We said any matrix a plus b,
they both have to have the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.200
same dimensions.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.160
So they're both m by
n in this case.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.110
And we defined this addition to
be a new matrix, where each

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.920
column of this matrix is the
sum of the corresponding

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.150
columns of these matrices.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.640
So this matrix's first column
will be the sum of a's first

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.870
column and b's first column.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.200
So a1 plus b1, the second column
I'll do a little line

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.000
here is, a2 plus b2.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.515
And it goes all the
way to An plus Bn.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.570
This was a definition.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.080
And the whole reason why we
made this definition, is

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.350
because if you defined matrix
addition in this way, then

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.410
this thing, when you replace it
with Ax plus Bx, you get to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.220
that this thing over here is
equal to the corresponding

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.655
matrices by this definition,
a plus b times x.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.480
This was the motivation to get
to a nice expression, like

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.020
this, for defining matrix
addition in this way.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.750
Now this all seems very
abstract, so let's actually

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.680
add a matrix, or let's
add two matrices.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.760
So we'll start off with
a two-by-two case.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.450
So let's say I'm adding the
matrix 1, 3, minus 2, 4 to the

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.290
matrix, remember they have to
have the same dimensions, to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.020
the matrix 2, 7, minus
3, minus 1.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.350
What do we get?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.440
Well by definition, you
just add up their

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.640
corresponding columns.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.760
You add up the first column.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.480
When you add up the
corresponding columns, what

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.320
happens when you add up two
columns, two vectors?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.830
Well, you just add up their
corresponding entries.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.800
So essentially, when you add
up to matrices, you're just

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.650
adding up all of the
corresponding entries.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.970
I'll talk about it in this way,
just because that's how I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.620
defined it, but they're
all equivalent.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.370
The first thing, the first
column, in this matrix right

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.050
here, is going to be this
column plus this column.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.440
So it's going to be 1 plus 2,
let me write it like this, and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.320
then minus 2, minus 3.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.380
And then the second column, that
one right there, is going

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.160
to be 3 plus 7 and
then 4 minus 1.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:30.720
And so this will be equal
to 3, 10, minus 5, and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.760
3, just like that.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.940
And notice, even though the
definition is I'm adding up

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.860
corresponding columns.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.660
Well, what in effect happened?

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.370
Well, I'm just adding up the
corresponding entries.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.090
I added the 1 to the 2, the 3
to the 7, the minus 2 to the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.300
minus 3, the 4 to the minus 1.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.960
It's that straightforward.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.600
Nothing fancier than that.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.355
In fact, we could have rewritten
this definition.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.510
If we say that the vector or the
matrix a is equal to a11

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.810
a12, all the way to a1n.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.120
And then if you go down this
is a21 all the way to a1n.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.910
And then you go all the
way down there to ann.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.980
We've seen that before.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.360
And then the matrix b, just
by the same argument or by

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.910
similar definition, this is b11,
that entry is b11, that's

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.040
b12, all the way to b1n.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.040
This is b21, second row, all the
way down to bn, sorry this

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.540
is m, we have m rows,
so this is mn.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.440
So this right here is bm1, this
would be bm2, all the way

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.530
down to this is bmn,
right there.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.420
Want to be very careful, these
are m by n matrices.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.150
So this row down here is the
mth row in both cases.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.390
But we could redefine our
matrix, or another way of

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.060
stating this matrix addition
definition, is to say, if I'm

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.270
going to add a plus b, I'm
just going to add up the

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.400
corresponding entries.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.010
So this entry up here is going
to be-- do it in a different

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.740
color --it's going to be a11
plus b11 this one's going to

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:24.610
be a21 plus b21 all the way
down to am1 plus bm1.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.820
And then this is going to be,
of course, a12 plus b12 all

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.620
the way to a1n-- let me scroll
over a little bit --all the

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.990
way over to a1n plus b1n,
and then all the way

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.510
down to amn plus bmn.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.940
These are equivalent
definitions.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.430
This takes a lot less space
to write in and I felt

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.750
comfortable doing it because
we've already

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.210
defined vector addition.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.730
But it essentially boils down
to you just add up all the

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.990
corresponding entries.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.820
That's all matrix addition is.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.960
It's probably one of the
simplest things that you've

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.650
seen in your recent mathematical
experience.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.860
Now, matrix scalar
multiplication,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.500
very similar idea.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.590
We defined scalar multiplication
times a

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:19.090
transformation of x to be equal
to a scalar times the

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.430
transformation of x.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.680
This was a definition.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:31.380
And we also defined scalar
times some matrix a to be

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.300
equal to the scalar.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.450
A new matrix where each of its
columns are the scalar times

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.820
the column vectors of a.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.320
So a1, and then the next column
is ca2, and then you go

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.730
all the way to can.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.820
And the whole motivation for
this was, because this could

00:07:52.820 --> 00:08:00.025
be simplified to-- well t I've
said was equal to Bx, a times

00:08:00.025 --> 00:08:02.590
the transformation of x
--the transformation t

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.350
of x was equal to.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.820
So we still have our c.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.040
So it's going to be c
times the matrix B,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.070
times the vector x.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.240
That's what the transformation
of x could be written as.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:24.690
And so this would be equal to by
just manipulating-- and we

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.760
did this in the last video by
actually breaking this up in

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.360
the column vectors multiplying
them by each of the components

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.309
of x, and then distributing the
c and rearranging them a

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.140
little bit.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.720
We can now say, using this
definition, that this is equal

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.049
to some new matrix cB.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.150
We're using this definition,
some new matrix cB, where it's

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.320
essentially c times
each of the column

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.930
vectors of B times x.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.730
This right here was
our motivation.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.710
We wanted to be able express
this as a product of some new

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.850
matrix and a vector, because
any linear transformation

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.360
should be expressible
in that way.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.580
And that's why we made
this definition.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.600
Now let's apply it.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.070
And I wanted to show you that
this is perhaps even simpler

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.500
than matrix addition.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.330
So if we want to multiply the
scalar 5 times the matrix,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.410
I'll do a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:20.410
So 1, minus 1, 2, 3, 7, 0.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.440
This will just be equal to--
by this definition I'm just

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.430
saying, I'm multiplying the
scalar times each of the

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.110
column vectors.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.640
So it's 5 times 1, 2, 7.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.570
But what's that?

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.340
That's just 5 times each
of the entries.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.950
It's 5 times 1, which is 5.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.170
5 times 2, which is 10.

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.480
5 times 7, which is 35.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.110
Then the next column is going
to be 5 times this column

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.580
right here, which is just 5
times each of its entries.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.490
So 5 times minus 1 is minus 5.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.110
5 times 3 is 15.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.340
5 times 0 is 0.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.150
It's that simple.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:57.770
You literally, if we go back
to this definition, we can

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.990
define scalar multiplication
of a matrix.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:04.680
So we could also define cA as
being equal to, if we'd say

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.200
this is a representation for A,
of the scalar c times each

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.180
of the entries of A.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.780
That's it.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:14.380
So it's c times a11,
c times a12 all the

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.450
way to c times a1n.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.070
You go down this way, c times
a21 all the way down to c

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.410
times am1 and then if you
go down the diagonal,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.540
it's be c times amn.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.080
You literally just take your
scalar and multiply it times

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.230
every entry in A.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.720
And that's all you have to do.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.240
So hopefully this clarified
things up a little bit, or

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.060
maybe it was a bit of a review
