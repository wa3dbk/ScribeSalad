00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.810
Let's say I have a matrix where
everything below the

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.530
main diagonal is a 0.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.610
And I'll start-- just for the
sake of argument, let's start

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.860
with a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.930
I have the values
a, b, 0, and d.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.180
Instead of a c, I have a 0
there, so everything below the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.260
main diagonal is a 0.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.190
What is the determinant
of this going to be?

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.590
Let's call that matrix a.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.000
The determinant of a is going
to be equal to ad

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.890
minus b times 0.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.900
That's just a 0, so you don't
have to write it.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.030
It's equal to a times d.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.710
Now, let's say I have
another matrix.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.332
Let's call it b.

00:00:43.332 --> 00:00:45.855
We'll say it's a
3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.860
And let's say its entries
are a, b, c.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.750
We've got a 0 here.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.360
Then you-- let's say you have
a d here, e, then you have

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.660
another 0 here, another 0
here, and you have an f.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.510
Once again, all of the entries
below the main diagonal are 0.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420
What's this guy's determinant?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.550
Well, we learned several videos
ago that you can always

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.160
pick the row in the column that
has the most 0's on it.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.240
That simplifies your
situation.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.330
Let's find the determinant along
this column right here.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.660
The determinant of b is going
to be equal to a times the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.030
submatrix if you were to ignore
a's row and column.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:42.410
a times the determinant of d,
e, 0, f, and then minus 0

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.550
times its submatrix.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.570
You could cancel out-- or times
the determinant of its

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.830
submatrix, that row
and that column.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.190
You'd get b, c, 0, f.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.980
And then you have plus 0 times--
you get rid of that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.120
row, that column, you
get b, c, d, e.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.590
Obviously, these two guys
are going to be 0.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.760
I don't care what these 2 by
2 matrices-- what their

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.539
determinants end up
evaluating to.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.850
These are both going to be
equal to 0, because we're

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.380
multiplying by 0.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.100
We're left with a times the
determinant of this, and the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.670
determinant of this is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670
We're going to have-- it's just
going to be equal to a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.550
times the determinant of this,
which is df minus 0 times e.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.800
It's just going to be df.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.240
The determinant of b is adf.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.640
Notice that the determinant
of a was just a and d.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.430
Now, you might see a pattern.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.590
In both cases we had 0's below
the main diagonal, right?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.260
This was the main diagonal
right here.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.250
And when we took the
determinants of the matrix,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.140
the determinant just ended up
being the product of the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.230
entries along the
main diagonal.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.390
And if you think that that's
a general trend that always

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.290
applies, you are correct.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.130
We can do it in the
general case.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.340
Let's do it with our
general case.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.710
Let's say we have some matrix,
a, and it is equal to a, 1, 1.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.460
And you have a, 2, 2.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.390
You're going to have
a 0 right there.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.660
And then you just keep going all
the way down to a, n, n.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.560
In this row, everything's going
to be a 0, except for

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.920
that last column.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.960
This is all a 0 right here.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.120
So everything below the main
diagonal is a 0, just like

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.720
this one, but we're doing it
in the general n by n case.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.075
And everything up here is--
well, it doesn't have to be 0.

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.980
This is a, 1, 2, all
the way to a, 1, n.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.530
This is a, 2, n.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.320
Keep going down.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.070
So everything at the main
diagonal or above isn't

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.680
necessarily equal to 0.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.440
If you wanted to find the
determinant of a, we could do

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.410
the same thing we did here.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.270
We could go down that first
row right there.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.200
The determinant of our matrix,
a, is equal to this guy-- a,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.960
1, 1-- times the determinant
of its submatrix.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.895
That's going to be a, 2, 2.

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:20.329
It goes all the way to a, 2, n,
and then a, 3, 3, all the

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.410
way to a, n, n.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.190
And then, everything down here
is-- these are all 0's.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.160
Once again, we have another
situation where all of the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.940
entries below the main
diagonal are 0.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.480
What's the determinant of
this guy right here?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.860
And what-- you might say
hey, what about the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.570
rest of that row?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.850
Well, the rest of the row is
just a bunch of 0's, just like

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.570
we had here.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.435
0 times the determinant of its
submatrix, and then that would

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:48.640
be a minus and a plus.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.260
0 times the determinant of its
submatrix, so on and so forth.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.900
We just have to pay attention
to this term right there.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.360
Now, the same argument
we can do here.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.090
To find this determinant, we
can just go down that row.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.870
The determinant of this is just
going to be equal to--

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.010
let's write out-- let's not
forget our a, 1, 1 out there.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.187
The determinant of this is going
to be a, 2, 2 times the

00:05:14.187 --> 00:05:15.370
determinant of its submatrix.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.290
Get rid of its row and its
column, and you're just left

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.880
with a, 3, 3 all the way
down to a, n, n.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.520
Everything up here is non-zero,
so its a, 3n.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.440
Then everything below the
diagonal, once again, is just

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.960
a bunch of 0's.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.630
Everything down here
is a bunch of 0's.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.650
This is another of
what we call an

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.090
upper triangular matrix.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.110
Let me write that down.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.980
This whole class, where you
have 0's below the main

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.200
diagonal, these are called upper
triangular matrices.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.080
Matrices, just like that.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.940
Now, we keep doing the process
over and over again.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.100
If you just keep following this
pattern over and again,

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.250
now you're going to have the
determinant of this is a, 3, 3

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.400
times its submatrix.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.820
And every time, the
submatrix is

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.440
getting smaller and smaller.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.160
You'll eventually get to a, 1,
1 times a, 2, 2 times-- all

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:22.950
the way to an minus 2 times
a 2 by 2 matrix over here.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.320
This is going to be an minus
1, n minus 1, an.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.260
Then this is going to be
a sub n minus 1, n.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.770
Then you're going to have
a 0 right here.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.130
It's just the bottom right-hand
corner of our

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.750
original matrix, is what you're
going to be left with.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.890
And what is the determinant
of this?

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.900
Well, it's just the product
of these two things.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.820
It's just this guy times this
guy minus this guy times that

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.480
guy, but that's just 0.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:56.080
The determinant of a ends up
becoming a, 1, 1 times a, 2,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.520
2, all the way to a, n, n, or
the product of all of the

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.430
entries of the main diagonal.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.850
Which is a super important take
away, because it really

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.210
simplifies finding the
determinants of what would

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.880
otherwise be really hard
matrices to find the

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.300
determinants of.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.830
You could imagine if this
was a 100 by 100 matrix.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.300
Now, we could just multiply
the diagonal.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.020
Just to make sure that
things are clear,

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.725
let me do an example.

00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:27.230
Let's say we find the
determinant of 7, 3, 4, 2.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.340
So we have 0's here.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.650
This is a minus 2, 1, and a 3,
a 0 here-- sorry, we don't

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.750
want 0's there.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.190
We don't need to
have 0's there.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.480
6, 7-- we actually could have
0's there, but we don't need

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.950
to have 0's there.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.780
And a 0 there, and we
have 0's there.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.500
Just like that.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.650
So

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.680
its upper triangular matrix--
if you want to evaluate this

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.220
determinant, you just multiply
these entries right here.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.880
The determinant is equal to 7
times minus 2 times 1 times 3.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.730
So it's 7 times minus 6 which
is equal to minus 42.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.740
And it's that easy.
