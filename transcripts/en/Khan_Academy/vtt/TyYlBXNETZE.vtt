00:00:00.172 --> 00:00:02.282
- [Voiceover] So I've said that
if you have a vector field,

00:00:02.282 --> 00:00:03.559
a two-dimensional vector field

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:05.741
with component functions P and Q,

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:09.793
that the divergence of this
guy, the divergence of v,

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:13.300
which is a scalar-valued
function of x and y,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.957
is by definition, the
partial derivative of P,

00:00:16.957 --> 00:00:20.696
with respect to x, plus the
partial derivative of Q,

00:00:20.696 --> 00:00:22.320
with respect to y.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.282
And there's actually another
notation for divergence

00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:26.308
that's kind of helpful for
remembering the formula.

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:29.159
And what it is, is you
take this nabla symbol,

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.794
that upside down triangle that
we also use for the gradient,

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:34.720
and imagine taking the
dot product between that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.487
and your vector-valued function.

00:00:36.487 --> 00:00:38.134
And as we did with the gradient,

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:41.285
the loose mnemonic you have
for this upside down triangle,

00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:42.951
as you think of it as a vector,

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:45.053
full of partial differential operators,

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:47.014
and that sounds fancy but all it means

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:49.453
is you kind of take
this partial, partial x,

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:51.241
a thing that wants to take in a function

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.706
and take its partial derivative,

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.295
and that's its first component,

00:00:54.295 --> 00:00:57.591
and the second component
is this partial, partial y,

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.356
a thing that wants to take in a function

00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:01.736
and take its partial
derivative with respect to y.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:03.718
And, you know, loosely
this isn't really a vector,

00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:06.276
these aren't numbers, or
functions, or things like that,

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:07.695
but it's something you can write down

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:10.014
and it'll be kind of helpful symbolically.

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.557
And you imagine taking
the dot product with that,

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.673
and, you know, v who has components,

00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:19.840
these scalar-valued functions,
P of xy, and Q of xy.

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:24.622
And when you imagine
doing this dot product,

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:25.861
and you're kind of lining up terms

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:27.728
and the first one multiplied
by the second, right,

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:30.198
quote unquote multiplied,
because, in this case,

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:32.464
when I say this first
component multiplied by p,

00:01:32.464 --> 00:01:35.148
I really mean you're taking
that partial derivative operator

00:01:35.148 --> 00:01:39.070
partial, partial x,
and evaluating it at p.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.577
That's kind of what multiplication
looks like in this case.

00:01:41.577 --> 00:01:44.537
So, you take that, and as per
the dot product you then add,

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.693
what happens if you take
this partial operator,

00:01:46.693 --> 00:01:49.939
this partial, partial
y, and quote unquote,

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.250
multiply it with q.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.436
Which, in the case of an operator,

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.200
means you kind of give it the function q

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.213
and it's gonna take
its partial derivative.

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:58.199
So, we see we get the
same thing over here,

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.429
it's the same formula that we have,

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.786
and it's just kind of a nice, little,

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:04.545
you can think of it as a mnemonic device

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:07.736
for remembering what the divergence is.

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:11.819
But another nice thing, this can apply

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.809
to higher-dimensional functions, as well.

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:18.260
Right? If we have
something that, let's see,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.880
something that's a vector-valued function,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.867
and it's gonna be a
three-dimensional vector field.

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.271
So, it's got x, y, and z as its inputs,

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:27.027
and its output then also has
to have three dimensions.

00:02:27.027 --> 00:02:30.474
So, it might be like, P, Q, and R,

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:32.682
and all of these are functions of x and y.

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:36.698
So, that's P of x and y, Q,
oh no, x, y, and z, right?

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.708
So, P of x, y, kind of got in the habit

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:43.875
of two dimensions there, P of
x, y and z, Q of x, y, and z,

00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:49.120
and then R of x, y, and z.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.498
And I haven't talked about
three-dimensional divergence.

00:02:51.498 --> 00:02:52.581
But if you think of this

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.929
and then you imagine
doing your nabla, dotted

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.971
with the vector-valued function,
it can still make sense.

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.654
And in this case, that
nabla you're thinking of

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:04.002
as having three different components.

00:03:04.002 --> 00:03:07.878
It's gonna be, on the one
hand this partial, partial x,

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:11.143
I should say partial x there, partial x,

00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:14.799
now the second component
is partial, partial y,

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.790
and the last component
is partial, partial z.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.342
And the ordering of
these, of the variables,

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.741
here, x, y and z is just
whatever I have here.

00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:23.981
So, even if they didn't
have the names x, y, z,

00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:24.994
you kinda out them in the same order

00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:27.059
that they show up in your function.

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.055
And when you imagine taking
the dot product between this,

00:03:30.055 --> 00:03:32.964
and your P as a function, Q as a function,

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:36.464
and R as a function, vector-valued output,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.729
what you get, and I'll write it over here,

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.076
you take that partial, partial
x and kind of multiply it,

00:03:46.076 --> 00:03:49.757
with P, which means you're
really evaluating at P.

00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:51.840
So, partial x here.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.319
Then you add partial, partial y.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.977
And you're evaluating at Q,
because you're kind of imagining

00:03:57.977 --> 00:03:59.592
multiplying these second components.

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:00.660
And you'll add what happens

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.479
when you multiply by
these third components,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.646
or that's partial, partial
z, by that last component.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.990
And, you know, since I haven't talked

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.321
about three-dimensional vector fields,

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:15.046
with three-dimensional
divergence, this last term,

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:17.308
maybe it's not given that you'd
have as strong an intuition

00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:19.690
for why this shows up in
divergence as the other two,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.803
but it's actually quite similar,

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:23.561
you're thinking about changes
to the z component of a vector

00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.661
as the value z, of the input,

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.643
as you're kind of moving up

00:04:26.643 --> 00:04:29.242
and down and that direction changes.

00:04:29.242 --> 00:04:31.652
But this pattern will go
for even higher dimensions

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:34.694
that we can't visualize, four,
five, 100, whatever you want.

00:04:34.694 --> 00:04:37.100
And that's what makes this
notation here quite nice,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.643
is that it encapsulates that

00:04:38.643 --> 00:04:40.825
and gives a really compact way

00:04:40.825 --> 00:04:43.015
of describing this formula that,

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:44.184
it has a simple pattern to it,

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:47.137
but would otherwise kind of
get out of hand to write.

00:04:47.137 --> 00:04:47.970
See you next video.
