00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.256
We're asked to simplify r to the
2/3 s to the third, that

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:05.370
whole thing squared.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.050
Times the square root of 20r to
the fourth s to the fifth.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.040
Now this looks kind of daunting,
but I think if we

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.480
take it step by step it
shouldn't be too bad.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.100
So first we can look at this
first expression right here

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
where we're taking this product
to the second power.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.390
We know that instead we can take
each of the terms in the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.410
product to the second power
and then take the product.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
So this is going to be the same
thing as r to the 2/3

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.560
squared times s to the
third squared.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
And now let's look at this
radical over here.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.690
We have the square root, but
that's the exact same thing as

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.030
raising something to
the 1/2 power.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.340
So this is equal to--
so times this part.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.330
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.090
This part right here, that
is the same thing as 20.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.540
And instead of just writing
20, let me write 20 as the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.210
product of a perfect square
and a non-perfect square.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.230
So 20 is the same thing
as 4 times 5.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.990
That's the 20 part.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.250
Times r to the fourth times
s to the fifth.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.750
Now let me write s to the fifth
also as a product of a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510
perfect square and a
non-perfect square.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.440
r to the fourth is obviously
a perfect square.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.080
Its square root is r squared.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.840
But let's write s to the
fifth in a similar way.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.830
So s to the fifth we can
rewrite as s to the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.150
fourth times s.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.280
Right?

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.010
S to the fourth times s to the
first, that is s to the fifth.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.480
And of course, all of this has
to be raised to the 1/2 power.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720
Now let's simplify
this even more.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.790
If we're taking something to the
2/3 power and then to the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.290
second power, we can just
multiply the exponents.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.030
So this term right here,
we can simplify this as

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.420
r to the 4/3 power.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.560
And just as a bit of review,
taking something to the 4/3

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.910
power, you can view it as either
taking-- finding its

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.790
cube root, taking it to the 1/3
power, and then taking its

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.470
cube root to the fourth power.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.130
Or you can view it as taking
it to the fourth power and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.070
then finding the cube
root of that.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.090
Those are both legitimate ways
of something being raised to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.210
the 4/3 power.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.840
So you have r to the 4/3 times
s to the 3 times 2.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.990
Times s to the sixth power.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.130
And then we could raise each of
these terms right here to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.720
the 1/2 power.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.685
So times-- let me color
code it a little bit.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:23.630
And we actually wouldn't
need the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.750
parentheses once we do that.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.800
Times 4 to the 1/2 times
5 to the 1/2.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.520
That term right there.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.920
Times r to the fourth
to the 1/2 power.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.620
Times-- I might run out of
colors-- s to the fourth to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.870
the 1/2 power.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.670
We're raising each of these
terms to that 1/2 power.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.380
Times s to the 1/2 power.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.990
There's a lot of ways we can
go with this, but the one

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.800
thing that might jump out is
that there are some perfect

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.280
squares here and we're raising
them to the 1/2 power.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.170
We're taking their
square roots, so

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.800
let's simplify those.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.890
So this 4 to the 1/2, that's
the same thing as 2.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.550
We're taking the principal
root of 4.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.770
5 to the 1/2?

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.050
Well, we can't take the square
root of that, so let's just

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.385
write that as the square
root of 5.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.780
r to the fourth to the 1/2.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.900
There's two ways you
can think about it.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.330
4 times 1/2 is 2.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.590
So this is r squared.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.140
Or you could say the
square root of r to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.800
the fourth is r squared.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.760
So this is r squared.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.270
Similarly, the square root of
s to the fourth or s to the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.780
1/2 is also s squared.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.900
And then this s to the 1/2,
let's just write that as the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.490
square root of s.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.380
Just like that.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.900
Let's see what else
we can do here.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.030
Let me write these other terms.
We have an r to the 4/3

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.830
times s to the sixth times 2
times square root of 5 times r

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.840
squared times s squared times
the square root of s.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.800
Now, a couple of things
we can do here.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.490
We could combine these s
terms. Let's do that.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.230
Actually, just write the 2 out
front first. So let's write

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.910
the 2 out front first.
So you have 2 times.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.990
Now let's look at these
two s terms over here.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.770
We have s to the sixth
times s squared.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.500
When someone says to simplify
it, there's multiple

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.560
interpretations for it.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.650
But we'll just say s to the
sixth times s squared.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.840
That's s to the eighth.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.760
6 plus 2.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.290
Times s to the eighth power.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.800
Times-- now this one's
interesting and we might want

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.040
to break it up depending on what
we consider to be truly

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.630
simplified.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.516
We have r to the 4/3
times r squared.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.440
r to the 4/3 is the same thing
as r to the 1 and 1/3.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.040
That's what 4/3 is.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.750
So 1 and 1/3 plus
2 is 3 and 1/3.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.520
So we could write this times
r to the 3 and 1/3.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.840
That's a little inconsistent.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.460
Over here I'm adding
a fraction.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.850
Over here with the s I kind of
left out the s to the 1/2 from

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:13.545
the s's here.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:15.840
But we could play around with
it and all of those would be

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.660
valid expressions.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.050
So we've already dealt
with the 2.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.960
We've already dealt with
these two s's.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.190
We've already dealt
with these r's.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.020
And then you have the square
root of 5 times the

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.770
square root of s.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.070
And we could merge them
if we want, but I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.610
won't do it just yet.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.790
Times the square root of 5 times
the square root of s.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.170
Now there's two ways
we could do it.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.650
We might not like having a
fractional exponent here.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.840
And then we could
break it out.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.430
Or we might want to take this
guy and merge it with the

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.410
eighth power.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.440
Because you know that
this is the same

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.880
thing as s to the 1/2.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.300
So let's do it both ways.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.380
So if we wanted to merge all
of the exponents, we could

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.900
write this as 2 times s to the
eighth times s to the 1/2.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.300
So s to the eighth
and s to the 1/2.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.430
That would be 2 times s
to the 8-- I can even

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.410
write it as a decimal.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.480
8.5.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.850
8 plus-- you could imagine this
is s to the 0.5 power.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.630
So that's 8.5 times r
to the 3 and 1/3.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.260
I'm kind of mixing
notations here.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.740
I have just a decimal notation,
then I have a

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.910
fraction notation, mixed
number notation.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.350
Times the square root of 5.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.700
This is one simplification.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.140
I kind of have it in the
fewest terms possible.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.420
The other simplification if you
don't want to have these

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.170
fractional exponents out here,
you could write it as-- I'll

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.840
do this in a different color.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.790
You could write this-- and
these are all equivalent

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.330
statements.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.050
So it's up to debate what
simplified really means.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:45.270
So you could write this as
2 times s to the eighth.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.950
Instead of writing r to the 3
and 1/3, we could write r to

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.870
the third times the cube root of
r, which is the same thing

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.720
as r to the 1/3.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.250
We could write r to the third
times r to the 1/3.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.000
r to the 1/3 is the same thing
as the cube root of r.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.730
And then you have the square
root of these two guys.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.390
Both of these guys are being
raised to the 1/2 power.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.830
So you could then say times
the square root of 5s.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.300
I like this one a little bit
more, the one on the left.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.070
To me this is really
simplified.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.030
We've merged all of the bases.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.190
We have these two numbers, we've
merged all the s terms,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.370
all the r terms. This is a
little bit more complicated.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.200
You have a cube root.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.130
You haven't separated
the s's and the r's.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.870
So I would go with this one if
someone really wanted me--

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.680
said hey, Sal, simplify
it how you like.
