00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.960
OK, welcome back.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.280
We're now on problem number
15, and I tried my best to

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.090
draw this graph ahead of time.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.890
This is probably one of the more
difficult for me with my

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.630
shaky hand.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.510
Let's see what this says.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.180
So this is point O for the
origin right here.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.590
This is point P.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.561
This is point Q.

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:27.160
Then of course this is the
y-axis, this is the x-axis.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.910
And they say that this graph,
right here, is y is equal to a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.380
minus x squared.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.150
And this curve right here is
y is equal to x squared.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.420
So the question says, in the
figure above, the graphs y

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.670
equals x squared and y equals
a minus x squared for some

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.450
constant a-- oh, those
are the graphs.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.030
Right.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:05.420
If the length of PQ is equal to
6, what is the value of a?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.710
Well, it's interesting.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.330
So the first thing that should
jump out at you is that these

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.950
are completely symmetric
graphs, right?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.120
They both are kind
of mirror images

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.300
around the y-axis, right?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.920
So if this length is 6, then the
length of each of these--

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.340
then here is 3 and here is 3.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.280
Right?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.550
So what do we know about where
these graphs intersect?

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.050
Well, we know that they
intersect at the point 3, and

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.050
we know that they intersect as
well at the point minus 3.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.740
Those are where those two
graphs intersect.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.765
And that's a lot
of information.

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:47.200
And the way, once again, we came
to this conclusion was

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.020
that these are both symmetric
around the y-axis.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.960
So if this intersection
is 6 wide, soon. then

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.110
it's 3 on each side.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.320
Right?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.920
3 at the positive side, 3
at the negative side.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.550
So it intersects at x equals
3 and x equals minus 3.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.670
And if we want to figure out the
intersection, we can also

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.010
just set these two equal to
each other. y equals x

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.150
squared, y equals a
minus x squared.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:17.210
So we know that x squared must
be equal to a minus-- what am

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.330
I doing? a minus x squared.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.640
Or add x squared to both
sides of this equation.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.865
You get 2x squared
is equal to a.

00:02:27.865 --> 00:02:29.115
Right?

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.540
And this'll be true at the two
points, at the two x points,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.530
where these two graphs
intersect.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.930
Well, what are the x points?

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.760
We figured that out.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.990
It's 3 and minus 3.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.110
So if you put 3 in here,
you get 2 times 3

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.960
squared is equal to a.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.450
It's 2 times 9 is equal to a.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.170
a is equal to 18.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.060
And if you put minus 3 in here,
it'd be the same thing,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.080
because when you square it
the negative goes away.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.820
So a is 18.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.880
Not too bad.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.100
The key conclusion you have to
make is that they intersect at

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.480
the points positive
and negative 3.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.350
And then you just set the
equations equal to each other

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.150
and solve for a.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's do the next problem.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.240
Clear image.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.660
Set X has x members, and
set Y has y members.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.410
Set Z contains all the members
that are either in X or Y,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.130
with the exception of the
k common members.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.160
OK, so this sounds like
a Venn diagram.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.280
I don't know if you remember a
Venn diagram, but I'll show

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.500
you what one is.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.290
So let's say that
this is set X.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.590
And let's say that this
is set Y right here.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.130
Looks like a MasterCard
logo. you 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.230
So this is set Y,
this is set X.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.280
And it says, set Z consists of
all the members that are

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.520
either in set X or set Y,
with the exception of

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.180
the k common members.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.110
So this is the k common
members, right?

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.160
These are the things that
overlap with set X and set Y.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.990
So what does Z consist of?

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.990
Well, Z is going to be-- let
me pick a dark color.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.540
Z is going to be-- if I do the
fill tool-- it's going to be

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.850
that plus that.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.610
Right?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.520
Without the k, right?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.910
Because it says Z does not
include the overlap.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.270
So what are those two things?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.260
Let me go back to
the paint tool.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.640
Orange.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.060
It's going to be tacky with
all the colors I'm using.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.060
So there's x members
in all of X.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.760
x members in all of capital X.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.670
So how many members are
in this blue region?

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.170
So if there's x in the whole
region, there's going to be x

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.190
minus k in this blue
region, right?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.100
I just subtracted
out this k part.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.080
Similarly, Y has y members,
as the problem tells us.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.750
Capital Y set has lowercase
y members.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.190
But if we take out these k that
overlap, this is going to

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.920
be y minus k.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.800
I'm just subtracting it out.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.250
And so Z is this blue area
plus this blue area.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.440
So it'll be x minus
k plus y minus k.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.140
And that is equal to x plus y.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.420
We have two minus k's,
so it's minus 2k.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.720
And that is choice D.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.590
Not too bad, huh?

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.150
All right.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.470
I think we are all done with
this practice test. Hopefully

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.780
you found it vaguely useful.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.190
I'll see
