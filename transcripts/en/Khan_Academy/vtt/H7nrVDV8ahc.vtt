00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.150
SAL: The notion of a half-life
is useful, if we're dealing

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.950
with increments of time that are
multiples of a half-life.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.980
For example, where time
equals zero, we

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.190
have 100% of our substance.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.580
Then after time equals one
half-life, we'd have 50% of

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.550
our substance.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.350
At time is equal to two
half-lives, we'd have 25% of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.440
our substance, and so
on and so forth.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.300
So if I say that three
half-lives have gone by-- in

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.740
the case of carbon that would
be, what, roughly 15,000

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.840
years-- I can tell you roughly,
or almost exactly,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.030
what percentage of my original
element I still have. In the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.390
case of carbon-14, I'll tell
you what percentage of my

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.570
original carbon-14 has not
decayed into nitrogen, as yet,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.880
nitrogen-14.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.110
And that's useful, but what if I
care about how much carbon I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.460
have after 1/2 a year, or after
1/2 a half life, or

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.510
after three billion years,
or after 10 minutes?

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.980
What if I want a general
function.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.190
A general function, as a
function of time, that tells

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.430
me the number, or the amount,
of my decaying substance I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670
have. So that's what we're going
to do in this video.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.460
And it's going to be a little
mathy, but I think the math is

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.180
pretty straightforward,
especially if you've taken a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030
first-year course in calculus.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.650
And this is actually a pretty
neat application of it.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.050
So let's just think a little bit
about the rate of change,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.090
or the probability, or the
number particles that are

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.390
changing at any given time.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.910
So if we say, the difference
or change in our number of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.750
particles, or the amount of
particles, in any very small

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.140
period of time, what's this
going to be dependent on?

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.850
This is the number particles
we have in a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.860
given period time.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160
This is our rate of change.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.420
So one thing, we know that our
rate of change is going down.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.960
We know it's a negative
number.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.390
We know that, in the case of
radioactive decay, I could do

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.150
the same exercise with
compounding growth, where I

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.470
would say, oh no, it's not a
negative number, that our

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.680
growth is dependent on how much
we have. In this case the

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.800
amount we're decaying is
proportional, but it's going

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.400
to be the negative of how much
of the actual compound we

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.229
already have.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.800
Let me explain that.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.620
So what I'm saying is, look,
our amount of decay is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.830
proportional to the amount of
the substance that we already

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.200
are dealing with.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.700
And just to maybe make that a
little bit more intuitive,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.270
imagine a situation here
where you have 1

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.320
times 10 to the 9th.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.750
You have a billion carbon atoms.
And let's say over here

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.020
you have 1 times 10 to the 6th
carbon atoms. And if you look

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.260
at it at over some small period
of time, let's say, if

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.250
you look at it over one second,
let's say our dt.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.800
dt as an infinitesimally small
time, but let's say it's a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.670
change in time.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.610
It's a delta t.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.080
And let's say over one second,
you observe that this sample

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.720
had, I don't know, let's say you
saw 1000 carbon particles.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.970
You really wouldn't see that
with carbon-14, but this is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.840
just for the sake of
our intuition.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.910
Let's say over one second you
saw 1000 carbon particles per

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.020
second here.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.990
Well here you have 1000th of the
number particles in this

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.600
sample as this one.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.340
So, for every thousand particles
you saw decaying

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.810
here, you'd really expect to
see one carbon particle per

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.380
second here.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.260
Just because you have
a smaller amount.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.570
Now I don't know what the
actual constant is.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.040
But we know that no matter what
substance we're talking

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.060
about, this constant is
dependent on the substance.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.510
Carbon's going to be different
from uranium, is going to be

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.810
different from, you know,
we looked at radon.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.400
They're all going to
have different

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.710
quantities right here.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.390
And we can see that.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.670
We'll actually do it in the next
video, you can actually

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.170
calculate this from
the half-life.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.930
But the rate of change is always
going to be dependent

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.380
on the number of particles
you have, right?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.950
I mean, we saw that here
with half-life.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.340
When you have 1/2 the
number of particles,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.270
you lose 1/2 as much.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.180
Here, if we start with 100
particles here, we went to 50

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.070
particles, then we went to 25.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.115
When you start with 50, in a
period of time you lose 25.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:06.230
When you start with
100, you lose 50.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.700
So clearly the amount you lose
is dependent on the amount you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.400
started with, right?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.270
Over any fraction of
time, and here it's

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.840
a very small fraction.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.279
So what I set up here is really
fairly simple, but it

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.940
doesn't sound so simple to a lot
of people if you say it's

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.400
a differential equation.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.600
We can actually solve this using
pretty straightforward

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.860
techniques.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.750
This is actually a separation
of variables problem.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.490
And so, what can we do?

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.162
Let's divide both sides by N.

00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.920
We want to get all the N's on
this side and all the t stuff

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.200
on the other side.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.460
So if we have 1 over
N, dN over dt is

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.910
equal to minus lambda.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.560
I just divided both sides
of this by N.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.230
And then I can multiply both
sides of this by dt, and I get

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:05.520
1 over N dN is equal
to minus lambda dt.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.530
Now I can take the integral of
both sides of this equation.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.740
And what do I get?

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.200
What's the antiderivative?

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.370
I'm taking the indefinite
integral or the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.540
antiderivative.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.930
What's the antiderivative
of 1 over N?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:29.460
Well that's the natural log of
N plus some constant-- I'll

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.400
just do that in blue--
plus some constant.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.050
And then that equals-- What's
the antiderivative of just

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.570
some constant?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.880
Well it's just that
constant times the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.980
derivative, the variable.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.360
We're taking the antiderivative

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.725
with respect to.

00:05:43.725 --> 00:05:48.840
So minus lambda, times t,
plus some constant.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.630
These are different constants,
but they're arbitrary.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.930
So if we want, we can just
subtract that constant from

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.130
that constant, and put them all
on one side and then we

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.120
just get another constant.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.260
So this boils down to our
solution to our differential

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.490
equation is the natural log of
N is equal to minus lambda-t,

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.410
plus some other constant, I call
it c3, it doesn't matter.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.110
And now if we want to just make
this a function of N in

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.460
terms of t, let's take both of
these, or both take e to the

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.920
power of both sides of this.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.350
You can view that as kind of
the inverse natural log.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.150
So e to the power of ln of N,
ln of N is just saying what

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.420
power do you raise
e to to get to N?

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.720
So if you raise e to that
power, you get N.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.120
So I'm just raising both
sides of this equation.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.220
I'm raising e to both sides
of this equation.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.650
e to the ln of N is just N.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.570
And that is equal to e to the
minus lambda-t, plus c3.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.770
And now this can be rewritten
as, N is equal to e to the

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.350
minus lambda-t, times
e to the c3.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.630
And now once again this is an
arbitrary constant, so we can

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.450
just really rename that as,
I don't know, let me

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.700
rename it as c4.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.660
So, our solution to our
differential equation, N, as a

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.870
function of t, is equal to
our c4 constant, c4e

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.030
to the minus lambda-t.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.330
Now let's say, even better,
let's say is N equals 0.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.400
Let's say that N equals 0.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.130
We have N sub 0 of our sample.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.680
That's how much we're
starting off with.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.830
So let's see if we can
substitute that into our

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.990
equation to solve for c4.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:45.510
So we said N sub-0 is equal to,
let's put 0 in here, so

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.930
let's see, that's equal
to N sub naught.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:56.750
And that's equal to c4 times e
to the minus lambda, times 0.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.770
Well, minus anything
times 0 is 0.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.300
So it's e to the 0.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.710
So that's just 1.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.760
So c4 is equal to N naught,
our starting

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.770
amount for the sample.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.020
So we've actually got
an expression.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.560
We have the number of particles,
or the amount as a

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.080
function of t, is equal to the
amount that we start off with,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.220
at time is equal to 0,
times e to the minus

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.190
lambda, times time.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.010
And we just have to be careful
that we're always using the

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.610
time constant when we solve
for the different

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.590
coefficients.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.830
So this seems all abstract.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.049
How does this relate
to half-life?

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.390
Well let's try to figure out
this equation for carbon.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.190
This'll be true for
anything where we

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.200
have radioactive decay.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.150
If we actually had a plus sign
here it'd be exponential

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.039
growth as well.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:57.260
We know that carbon, c-14, has
a 5,700-year half-life.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.060
So the way you could think about
it, is if at time equals

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:08.240
0 you start off with t-- So time
equals 0. t equals-- let

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.020
me write that down.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:14.000
If at N of 0 is equal to--
and we could write

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.240
100 there if we want.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.090
Actually why don't we do that?

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.530
If N of 0 we start
off with 100.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:25.800
And then at N of 5,700 years--
so we're going to take t to be

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.620
in years, you just have to be
consistent with your units--

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.740
how much will we have left?

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.440
We'll have 50 left.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.096
We could have written x and x
over two here, and it would

00:09:34.096 --> 00:09:35.690
have all have worked
out in the end.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.980
So let's see, let's apply that
to this equation and try to

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.460
solve this for lambda.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.770
So we know N of 0
is equal to 100.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:51.060
So we immediately know that we
can write this equation as N

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:57.520
of t is equal to 100e, to the
minus lambda-t, at least in

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.080
this exact circumstance.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:10.450
And we also know that N of
5,700-- so that means, N of

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.600
5,700-- that is equal to,
we just said, that's one

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.450
half-life away.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.020
So we have 1/2 as much
of our compound left.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:25.560
That's equal to 50, which is
equal to the 5,700th power

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.830
times lambda.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.500
So it's equal to 100 times
e, to the minus

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.770
lambda, times 5,700.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.940
And now we just solve
for lambda.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.240
Then we'll have a general
equation for how much carbon

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.470
we have at any given
moment in time.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.850
So if you divide both sides
of this by 100.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.160
What do we get?

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.230
We get 0.5, we have 1/2, is
equal to e to the-- let me

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.200
just write minus 5,700 lambda,
and then we could take the

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.010
natural log of both sides.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.350
So then we get-- scroll down a
bit-- the natural log of 1/2

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.140
is equal to the-- the natural
log of this is just minus

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.890
5,700 lambda.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.510
To solve for lambda, you get
lambda is equal to the natural

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:16.210
log of 1/2, over minus 5,700.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.990
So let me see what that is.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.980
Let's see what that is.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:30.980
So 0.5 natural log is that,
divided by minus 5,700.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:38.456
5,700 negative is equal to 1.2
times 10 to the negative 4.

00:11:38.456 --> 00:11:43.410
Is equal to 1.21 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.370
So there you have it, we
figured out our lambda.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:49.440
So the general equation for
how much carbon-14 we can

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.340
expect at any moment in time,
t, where t is in years, is N

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.340
of t is equal to the amount of
carbon we start off with,

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.280
times e to the minus lambda.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.780
The minus lambda is 1.21
times 10 to the minus

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.350
4, times t in years.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.500
So now if you say after 1/2 a
year, you just plug it in and,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.630
you have to tell me how much you
started off with, and then

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.870
I can tell you how much you
have after 1/2 a year, or

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.060
after a billion years, or
after a gazillion years.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.360
And we'll do a lot
more of these

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.350
problems in the next video.
