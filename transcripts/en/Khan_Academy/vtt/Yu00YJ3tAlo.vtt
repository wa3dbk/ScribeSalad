00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:07.105
We've got... All of that divided by

00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:09.400
4xy

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.533
There are several ways to think about them, they're all equivalent

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.400
This is going to be the exact same thing. We can esssentialy sort of separate the numerators.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:34.667
This is the same thing as...

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.333
And there's multiple ways to think about it.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:40.000
One is: If I have a+b over c

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.800
this is clearly the same thing as a over c plus b over c

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.933
we're just adding the--we're taking the fraction apart.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.691
If we did it in reverse, we'd just be adding fractions

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.400
Another way to think about it is

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
We're distributing the division.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.000
We're dividing the whole thing by 4xy

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.096
so we divide each of the terms by 4xy.

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:00.349
The last way to think about it, which is really the same thing,

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:04.087
is that we're multiplying the whole thing by 1 over 4xy

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:07.600
So we're distributing the 1 over 4xy times everything

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800
which is the same as dividing by 4xy.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.667
Either way we get to this and we just have to simplify this

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.867
really just using exponent properties.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:20.867
So we can divide 12. 12 divided by 4 is pretty straight forward

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:25.267
that is just 3, so let me just write it this way.

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:30.400
So 12 divided by 4 is 3. And x squared

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.434
divided by x. Remember x is the same thing as x to the first power,

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:39.846
so thats going to be x to the three minus two

00:01:39.846 --> 00:01:45.200
Sorry, x to the three minus one power.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.013
Which would be x squared. And finally

00:01:52.013 --> 00:01:54.533
you have y to the third divided by y.

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.098
Well thats just divided by y to the one.

00:01:57.098 --> 00:02:01.022
and y to the third divided by y to the one is going to be y squared.

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:03.267
Three minus one is two.

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.733
Now lets do the next term.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:13.267
Plus, we have sixteen over 4, which is just four.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:18.925
That is just equal to four. Then we have x to the fourth over

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:23.733
x. Well, once again, x is just the same thing as x to the first

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:28.840
So this is going to be x to the four minus one or x to the third power.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.133
And then finally, we have y divided by y.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:34.733
Well, thats just going to be one.

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:39.133
So we don't even have to write it down. We could right one here,

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.682
but that wont do much, won't change the values.

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:43.400
So just these guys essentially cancel out. And then finally you have

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.800
ten divided by 4. they're both divisible by two, so it becomes five halves.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.523
So that part over there simplifies to five over two.

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:58.533
So, plus five halves and then x divided by x.

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.867
Those just cancel out, so thats just one.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.533
y divided by y, thats just one as well.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.133
So we're left with five halves.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:06.015
And we're done!

00:03:06.015 --> 99:59:59.999
This whole expression simplified to...
