00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
We're asked to simplify 12 plus,
and then in parentheses,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.100
5 minus 1 times 3 to the second
power, or 3 squared,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.170
minus 8 divided by the square
root, or really the principal

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.860
root, of 4.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.270
Now, whenever you see something
like this, you

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.080
really just want to put
your brain into order

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.610
of operations mode.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.720
And just to remind ourselves,
the top priority goes to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.840
parentheses, so I'll just draw
some parentheses there.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.940
Then after that, we
do exponents.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.970
And in exponents, we also
consider square

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.049
roots to be an exponent.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:35.770
So after parentheses, we then
worry about things that look

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.850
like a to the b power or things
that look like they

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.410
have a radical on them.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.580
You'll learn in the future that
the square root is really

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.960
raising something to
the 1/2 power.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.280
That's why it's the same
thing as an exponent.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.350
And then we do multiplication
and division.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.480
And then finally, you do
addition and subtraction.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.040
So let's apply that
to this over here.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.230
So we have one set of
parentheses right there.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.150
You have that parentheses, and
inside you have 5 minus 1, so

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.920
we want evaluate that
first of all.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.280
So 5 minus 1 is 4.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.370
So our problem becomes 12--
plus the 5 minus 1 is 4--

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.690
times 3 squared minus 8 divided
by the positive square

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.050
root of 4, the principal
root of 4.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.820
Now, we got all our parentheses
out of the way.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.070
Do we see any exponents here?

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.950
We're at this stage now.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.140
Well, I have this 3 to the
second power, 3 squared, and I

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.920
also have the square
root of 4, so let's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.640
evaluate those next.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.260
3 to the second power is 9.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.240
That's the same thing
as 3 times 3.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.060
So let me write that down
just as a review.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.710
3 to the second power is
equal to 3 times 3,

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.940
which is equal to 9.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.770
It is NOT equal to 3 times 2.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.180
It's 3 times 3.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.800
So 3 squared is 9, so we'll
put that 9 there.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.400
And the square root of 4, so the
square root of 4, I'll do

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.660
it down here.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.490
The square root of 4, what times
itself or what positive

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.710
number, or non-negative number,
I should say, times

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.600
itself is equal to 4?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.310
Well, it's 2, right?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.520
This is the same thing as the
square root of 2 times 2,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.190
which is equal to 2.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.230
So the principal root of 4 is 2,
and then we have everything

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.190
else there.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:47.510
We have the 12 plus this 4 times
this 9 minus 8 divided

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.950
by that 2 right there.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.490
Now, what's next?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.780
Well, we're done with the
parentheses and exponents.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.600
Now we go to the multiplication
and division.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.090
Is that going on anywhere?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.630
Well, sure.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.020
We have this multiplication
right over there, and then we

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.320
have this division right
over there, so lets

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.170
evaluate those next.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:14.390
So 4 times 9 is 36 and 8 divided
by 2 is 4, so we are

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.240
left with 12 plus 36 minus 8
divided by 2, which is 4.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.790
And now we're finally at this
stage of our order of

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.490
operation, so we can just
evaluate left to right.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.360
What is 12 plus 36?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.380
12 plus 36-- I'll do this
right here-- is 48.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.540
So we have 48 minus 4.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.610
When you evaluate that,
48 minus 4 is just 44.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.380
And we're all done!
