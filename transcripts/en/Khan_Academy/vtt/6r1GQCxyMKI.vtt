00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.210
Now

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.970
that you know what the conic
sections are and why they're

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.280
called conic sections, let's
see if we can understand the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.870
actual equations of the conic
sections a little bit better,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.030
and use that knowledge to be
able to at least recognize them

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.110
when we see the equation, and
then if we see the equation,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.780
know how to plot them.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.950
So the first one we'll start
off with is the circle.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.330
And you've probably seen this
for many years already,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.270
but I'll review, if you
don't know it already.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.490
The general form of an
equation, or the general

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.200
equation for a circle, is x
squared plus y squared is equal

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.830
to r squared, where r is
the radius of the circle.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.900
And this would be a circle
centered at the point 0,0.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.220
So I'll just draw this kind of
a general graph right here.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.880
So that's the x-axis, that's
the y-axis, the circle will

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.020
look like this-- let me do it
in a different color-- the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.900
circle would look something
like-- make sure it's a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.320
circle-- well, it's supposed to
be centered at 0,0, but that's

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.390
close enough-- so its center
will be right here, and the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.940
radius if you go from the
center to any point along that

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.800
circle will have a distance of
r, so if you go from there to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.940
there it's r, from there to
there it's r, from there to

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.050
there it's r, and to some
degree, this formula, all it is

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.580
is an extension of the distance
formula, which is really just

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.020
the extension of the
Pythagorean Theorem.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.490
So for example, the distance
formula, if I want to know the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.600
distance between some point x,y
and the point 0,0, what you do

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.720
is, you take the difference of
the x's-- so x minus 0-- you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.550
square that, and then you add
that to the distance between

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.390
the y's squared-- so that's one
y point minus 0y-- y is equal

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.560
to 0-- square that, and that is
equal to the distance squared.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.830
So if you simplify this, x
minus 0 squared, that's just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.610
x squared plus-- and this
is just y squared is equal

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.890
to distance squared.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.160
So essentially, this equation
is the plot of all points that

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.560
are exactly d away, a distance
of d away, from the point 0,0,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.270
and that's just a circle.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.010
And I'll let you think about
it, I think I actually showed

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.090
this to you in a distance
formula video, but the distance

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.560
formula just comes out of
the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.940
And if that's not completely
obvious for you, just think

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.540
about a little bit, and
it'll hopefully become a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.305
little bit more obvious.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.650
But anyway, this was probably--
you probably already knew this,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.730
and actually just to hit the
point home, if we had the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.890
equation like this x squared
plus y squared is equal to 9,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.232
the graph of this circle
would look like this.

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:56.120
So that's the x-axis, that's
the y-axis, then draw the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.300
circle itself, circle looks
like-- close enough, and then

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.850
the distance or the radius from
the center of the circle,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.530
that's going to be 3.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.250
There's a 9 here, why
isn't the radius 9?

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.740
Oh, that's because this
is the radius squared.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.650
Remember the original formula I
just showed you. x squared plus

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.470
y squared is equal
to r squared.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.630
So this right here is r
squared, so if r squared

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.370
is equal to 9, than
r is equal to 3.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.410
It can't be minus 3.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.430
I mean, it could, you can't
have a negative radius, or if

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.790
you did you're just going in
the other direction, but

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.530
it's the same thing.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.460
So the radius is equal to 3.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.480
So that's a circle, and that's
pretty straightforward, but in

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.790
a lot of algebra classes, they
complicate the issue a little

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.700
bit by shifting the circle.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.290
So let's just shift
this circle.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.600
Instead of having-- so
let me just rewrite it.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.990
So the unshifted circle was x
squared plus y squared is equal

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.920
to-- let me write it this way--
is equal to 3 squared, that's

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.050
the same thing as 9, and let's
say that the new circle, the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:13.730
shifted circle, is x minus 1
squared plus y plus 2 squared

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.650
is equal to 3 squared.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.830
Now all of a sudden this looks
really complicated and daunting

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.240
and all the rest, but all you
have to recognize is, we just

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.662
substituted an x minus 1 for
the-- whoops, messed

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:28.950
up my pointer.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.740
We just substituted an x
minus 1 for the x, and

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.280
we just substituted a
y plus 2 for the y.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.870
So it has the same basic
pattern as of this circle, and

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.610
the fact that we added or
subtracted numbers from the x's

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.440
and the y's tells us that we
shifted the circle, and so the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.260
next obvious question is,
where did you shift it to?

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.310
And your impulse might be, oh,
well maybe I shifted it to,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:06.430
instead of the center being
0,0, your intuition might be

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.280
to say that, well, now the
center is at negative 1,2.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.760
And you'd be almost right,
except you'd be exactly the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.120
opposite of the correct answer.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:26.960
The new center is now x is
equal to positive 1 and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.060
y is equal to minus 2.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.380
And that might be unintuitive
for you at first-- and you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.480
might want to watch some of the
videos, I think I've done them

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.460
already, or I've always
intended to, on shifting

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.570
functions-- but the way to
think about it is the center

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.070
here is x is equal to 0.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.110
So when x and y is equal to 0,
x squared plus y squared is 0,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.570
you're exactly 0 away from the
center, or we're at the center.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.010
So now if we want to be-- if we
want x to be 0 away from our

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.220
new center, this term
has to be equal to 0.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.680
And if-- just like when x was
equal to 0, this term equaled

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.360
0, so now for us to be at the
center of our new circle, so to

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.500
speak, this term has to be 0.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.240
So the new center has to
be at x is equal to 1.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.040
Likewise, this has to be
0, and so the center

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.710
is at y is equal to 2.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.400
Another way to think about it
is this-- let's say when y,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.880
you know what happens here
when y is equal to 2.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.220
Whatever part of the circle
we're in when y is equal to 2.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.670
There's some part of the circle
we're at, in fact I could draw

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.560
it, when y is equal to 2.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.580
Let's say this radius is 3 when
y is equal to 2, we're probably

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.190
right around there
on the circle.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.760
We could be there or
we could be there.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.470
Now we're shifting the circle,
so now instead of being at 0,0,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.860
we're going to be at 1 minus 2.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.160
So now we're going to be at the
new center is x is equal to 1,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.540
y is equal to minus 2, the new
center is there, and if I were

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.080
to draw the new circle, it
would look something like this.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.010
I'm going to try my best
to draw it still as a

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.000
circle and show you
that it's been shifted.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.850
No, that's not good.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:18.890
Let me draw it like-- I
pressed the wrong button.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.705
That's not good.

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:23.640
Let me draw it right there.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.560
That's close enough.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.920
I don't have to keep doing it.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:32.380
So what we did is we shifted
this circle down 2,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.540
and to the right 1.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.130
So if we take its center
point, we went down 2

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.460
and to the right 1.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.540
And so if you think about up
here, when y was equal to 2, we

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.080
could have been at this point
or this point, the kind of

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.740
equivalent points of the new
circle are going to be here.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.400
Are going to be roughly here,
where you're shifting it

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.395
down and to the right.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.230
And in order to have that
same behavior in the circle

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:08.550
there, this whole thing
should be equal to 2.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.210
So that same point on the
circle, if this whole thing is

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.770
going to be equal to 2--
because it's going to be the

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.190
same kind of behavior in the
equation, and I hope I'm not

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.680
confusing you there-- then the
new y has to be 0, and

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.430
you see it there.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.730
At both of these points
now, y is equal to 0.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.450
So I know that's a little
unintuitive, but I want you to

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.790
sit and think about that a lot.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.220
I mean, you could just memorize
it, that it's the opposite,

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.200
when you have x minus 1 and y
plus 2 that it's actually you

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.240
shifted to x is equal to-- the
center is now 1, minus 2, or

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.980
you could memorize, if you
like, that what makes this 0

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.780
and what makes this 0, and
that's your new center.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.410
But I really want you to
think about it, this

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.230
is really a shift.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.660
And of course, if you were
to graph it, you were to

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.570
get this thing up there.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.510
Anyway, let me see how
much time I have.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.240
Actually I didn't even
keep track of the time.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.490
I'll leave you there, I'll
continue this in the next video

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.810
where I'll talk a little
bit about ellipses.
