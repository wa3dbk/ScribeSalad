00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.010
i've already made a handful
of videos that covers what

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.990
I'm going to cover, the
trigonometric identities I'm

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.480
going to cover in this video.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.330
The reason why I'm doing it is
that I'm in need of review

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.220
myself because I was doing some
calculus problems that required

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.150
me to know this, and I have
better recording software now

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.550
so I thought two birds with one
stone, let me rerecord a

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.290
video and kind of refresh
things in my own mind.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.080
So the trig identities that I'm
going to assume that we know

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.730
because I've already made
videos on them and they're a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.060
little bit involved to remember
or to prove, are that the sine

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.980
of a plus b is equal to the
sine of a times the cosine

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.750
of b plus the sine of b
times the cosine of a.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.670
That's the first one, I assume,
going into this video we know.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.310
And then if we wanted to know
the sine of-- well, I'll just

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.270
write it a little differently.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.010
What if I wanted to figure out
the sine of a plus-- I'll

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.010
write it this way-- minus c?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.990
Which is the same thing
as a minus c, right?

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.590
Well, we could just use this
formula up here to say well,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.730
that's equal to the sine of a
times the cosine of minus c

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:24.020
plus the sine of minus c
times the cosine of a.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.480
And we know, and I guess this
is another assumption that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.580
we're going to have to have
going into this video, that the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.410
cosine of minus c is equal
to just the cosine of c.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.690
That the cosine is
an even function.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.620
And you could look at that by
looking at the graph of the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.420
cosine function, or even at
the unit circle itself.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240
And that the sine is
an odd function.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.770
That the sine of minus
c is actually equal

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.010
to minus sine of c.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.860
So we can use both of that
information to rewrite the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.710
second line up here to say that
the sine of a minus c is equal

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.450
to the sine of a times
the cosine of c.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.570
Because cosine of minus
c is the same thing

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.320
as the cosine of c.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.650
Times the cosine of c.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.510
And then, minus the sine of c.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.710
Instead of writing this,
I could write this.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.220
Minus the sine of c
times the cosine of a.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.080
So that we kind of pseudo
proved this by knowing this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.590
and this ahead of time.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.190
Fair enough.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.920
And I'm going to use all of
these to kind of prove a bunch

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.110
of more trig identities
that I'm going to need.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.280
So the other trig identity is
that the cosine of a plus b is

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.760
equal to the cosine of a-- you
don't mix up the cosines and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.520
the sines in this situation.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.595
Cosine of a times
the sine of b.

00:02:48.595 --> 00:02:51.180
And this is minus--
well, sorry.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720
I just said you don't mix it
up and then I mixed them up.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.010
Times the cosine of b minus
sine of a times the sine of b.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.140
Now, if you wanted to know what
the cosine of a minus b is,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.890
well, you use these
same properties.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.760
Cosine of minus b, that's still
going to be cosine on b.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.960
So that's going to be the
cosine of a times the cosine--

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.530
cosine of minus b is the
same thing as cosine of b.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.760
But here you're going to have
sine of minus b, which is the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.600
same thing as the
minus sine of b.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.060
And that minus will cancel that
out, so it'll be plus sine

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.070
of a times the sine of b.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.880
So it's a little tricky.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.610
When you have a plus sign
here you get a minus there.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.410
When you don't minus
sign there, you get

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.570
a plus sign there.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.520
But fair enough.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.230
I don't want to dwell on that
too much because we have many

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.750
more identities to show.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.340
So what if I wanted an
identity for let's

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.440
say, the cosine of 2a?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.760
So the cosine of 2a.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.500
Well that's just the same thing
as the cosine of a plus a.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.480
And then we could use this
formula right up here.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.050
If my second a is just my b,
then this is just equal to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.030
cosine of a times the cosine
of a minus the sine of

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.320
a times the sine of a.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.560
My b is also an a in this
situation, which I could

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.570
rewrite as, this is equal to
the cosine squared of a.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.960
I just wrote cosine of a times
itself twice or times itself.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.740
Minus sine squared of a.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.910
This is one I guess
identity already.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.630
Cosine of 2a is equal to the
cosine squared of a minus

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.240
the sine squared of a.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.140
Let me box off my identities
that we're showing

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.410
in this video.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.780
So I just showed you that one.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.050
What if I'm not satisfied?

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.700
What if I just want it
in terms of cosines?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.820
Well, we could break out
the unit circle definition

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.450
of our trig functions.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.740
This is kind of the most
fundamental identity.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.190
The sine squared of a
plus the cosine squared

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.700
of a is equal to 1.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.010
Or you could write that--
let me think of the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.410
best way to do this.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.590
You could write that the sine
squared of a is equal to

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.670
1 minus the cosine
sign squared of a.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.330
And then we could take this
and substitute it right here.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.110
So we could rewrite this
identity as being equal to the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.610
cosine squared of a minus
the sine squared of a.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.060
But the sine squared of
a is this right there.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.690
So minus-- I'll do it
in a different color.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.310
Minus 1 minus cosine
squared of a.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.260
That's what I just substituted
for the sine squared of a.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.050
And so this is equal to the
cosine squared of a minus 1

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.890
plus the cosine squared of a.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.270
Which is equal to--
we're just adding.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.030
I'll just continue
on the right.

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.400
We have 1 cosine squared of a
plus another cosine squared

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.780
of a, so it's 2 cosine
squared of a minus 1.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.610
And all of that is
equal to cosine of 2a.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.330
Now what if I wanted to get
an identity that gave me

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.710
what cosine squared of
a is in terms of this?

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.320
Well we could just
solve for that.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.930
If we add 1 to both sides of
this equation, actually,

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.510
let me write this.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.460
This is one of our
other identities.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:28.430
But if we add 1 to both sides
of that equation we get 2 times

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:36.750
the cosine squared of a is
equal to cosine of 2a plus 1.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.620
And if we divide both sides of
this by 2 we get the cosine

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.290
squared of a is equal to 1/2--
now we could rearrange these

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:54.660
just to do it-- times 1
plus the cosine of 2a.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.810
And we're done.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.640
And we have another identity.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:04.830
Cosine squared of a, sometimes
it's called the power reduction

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.380
identity right there.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.440
Now what if we wanted
something in terms of

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.200
the sine squared of a?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.170
Well then maybe we could go
back up here and we know from

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.300
this identity that the sine
squared of a is equal to 1

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.750
minus cosine squared of a.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:18.930
Or we could have
gone the other way.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.910
We could have subtracted sine
squared of a from both sides

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.000
and we could have gotten--
let me go down there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.570
If I subtracted sine squared of
a from both sides you could get

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:34.050
cosine squared of a is equal
to 1 minus sine squared of a.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.980
And then we could go back into
this formula right up here and

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.490
we could write down-- and I'll
do it in this blue color.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:48.480
We could write down that the
cosine of 2a is equal to--

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.750
instead of writing a cosine
squared of a, I'll write this-

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.780
is equal to 1 minus sine
squared of a minus

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.795
sine squared of a.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:05.245
So my cosine of 2a is equal to?

00:08:05.245 --> 00:08:05.910
Let's see.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.650
I have a minus sine squared
of a minus another

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:08.420
sine squared of a.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.600
So I have 1 minus 2
sine squared of a.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.480
So here's another identity.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.190
Another way to write
my cosine of 2a.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.740
We're discovering a lot of ways
to write our cosine of 2a.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.840
Now if we wanted to solve for
sine squared of 2a we could

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.610
add it to both sides
of the equation.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.950
So let me do that and I'll
just write it here for

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.554
the sake of saving space.

00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:36.230
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.210
So I'm going to go here.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.520
If I just add 2 sine squared
of a to both sides of this, I

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:51.480
get 2 sine squared of a plus
cosine of 2a is equal to 1.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.690
Subtract cosine of
2a from both sides.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:09:01.010
You get 2 sine squared of a is
equal to 1 minus cosine of 2a.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.420
Then you divide both sides of
this by 2 and you get sine

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:12.280
squared of a is equal to 1/2
times 1 minus cosine of 2a.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.250
And we have our other discovery
I guess we could call it.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.600
Our finding.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.520
And it's interesting.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.050
It's always interesting
to look at the symmetry.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.000
Cosine squared-- they're
identical except for you have a

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.720
plus 2a here for the cosine
squared and you have a minus

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.600
cosine of 2a here for
the sine squared.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.440
So we've already found a
lot of interesting things.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.080
Let's see if we can do
anything with the sine of 2a.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.980
Let me pick a new color
here that I haven't used.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.880
Well, I've pretty much
used all my colors.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.120
So if I want to figure out the
sine of 2a, this is equal

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.380
to the sine of a plus a.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:03.610
Which is equal to the sine of a
times the co-- well, I don't

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.640
want to make it that thick.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.150
Times the cosine of a plus--
and this cosine of a,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.100
that's the second a.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.020
Actually, you could
view it that way.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.570
Plus the sine-- I'm just
using the sine of a plus b.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.000
Plus the sine of the
second a times the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.870
cosine of the first a.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:22.030
I just wrote the same thing
twice, so this is just people

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.370
to 2 sine of a, cosine of a.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.490
That was a little bit easier.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:32.030
So sine of 2a is equal to that.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.140
So that's another result.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.160
I know I'm a little bit tired
by playing with all of

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.640
these sine and cosines.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.990
And I was able to get all the
results that I needed for my

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.580
calculus problem, so hopefully
this was a good review for

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.220
you because it was a
good review for me.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.360
You can write these
things down.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.840
You can memorize them if you
want, but the really important

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.350
take away is to realize that
you really can derive all of

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:59.590
these formulas really from
these initial formulas

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.250
that we just had.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.910
And even these, I also have
proofs to show you how to get

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.100
these from just the basic
definitions of your

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.700
trig functions.
