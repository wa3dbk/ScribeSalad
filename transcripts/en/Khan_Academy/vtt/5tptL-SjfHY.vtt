00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.440
Welcome back.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.665
We are now on problem
number 12, which

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:04.915
I will do in magenta.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.180
All right.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.260
If 2x is less than y, which
is less than 0-- huh.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.460
So both of these are negative,
and 2x is more negative.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.420
All right.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.800
Which of the following
is greater?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.710
So they give us a bunch
of choices.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.140
So let's see.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.490
Choice A is minus 2x.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.390
Choice B is minus 2x plus y.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.890
Choice C is 2x.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.950
Choice D is 0.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.480
And choice E is minus y.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.540
OK.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.600
So the interesting thing that
should immediately jump out at

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.170
you is that both 2x and
y are negative, right?

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.400
Because they're all
less than 0.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.650
And 2x is even more
negative than y.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.850
Right?

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.080
If I were to draw a number line,
if this is the number

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.885
line-- we might be instructed
to even show it.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.830
This is 0.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.850
This is y.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.290
2x would be some place
over here.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.100
We don't know exactly where.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.500
This could be 0, this
could be-- I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.370
could pick random numbers.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.620
This could be negative 1.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.990
And then this could
be negative 2.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.400
Right?

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.650
These are just random numbers.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.420
And actually, that might
be the best way

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270
of doing this problem.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.370
We could reason through it,
and actually, I will.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.990
But the easiest thing is, well,
let me just take these

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.860
numbers that satisfy this
inequality and see what

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.170
happens with them, right?

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.110
And that probably is
the fastest way.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.720
So in our case, what's
minus 2x?

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.140
So if 2x is minus 2, that would
be minus times minus 2.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.440
Because 2x is minus 2.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.170
So that equals plus 2.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.370
What's 2x plus y?

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.410
So 2x is minus 2, plus
y is minus 1.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.000
So it becomes a minus 3.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.725
So this becomes minus minus 2
minus 1, so that's minus 3,

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:21.980
but then you have a minus
outside so it's plus 3.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.070
So we can immediately
say that this is not

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.840
the greatest, right?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.270
Because we already found
one that is greater.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.920
2x would be just minus 2.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.470
We said that. soon.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.820
2x is minus 2.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.610
0 is 0.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.150
Minus y in our example
would be 1.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.620
In all of these situations, this
is the largest. And you

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.940
could try it with any set of
numbers that satisfy this.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.820
We could have called this--
instead of saying this is 2x,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.940
we could have called
this z and done it.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.870
But without doing the number
line, and without picking

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.180
numbers, you could have
also reasoned.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.690
You could have said, 2x is
more negative than y.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.830
So if you put a negative in
front of 2x, it's going to be

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.916
more positive.

00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:05.590
Right?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.180
Because a negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.770
So it'll become a
more positive.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.620
So first of all, this number
will be a negative number, so

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.580
that's not right.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.370
This number will be positive,
so 0 can't be the answer.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.600
And then you say, well,
what's bigger?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.960
Minus y or minus 2x?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.370
Well, minus 2x is more negative,
so minus-- or sorry.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.460
2x is more negative, so minus
2x will be more positive.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.530
So you know it's not
going to be this.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.710
So then you're picking
between these two.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.020
And then you have to say, well,
what's more negative?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.410
2x or 2x plus y?

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.890
Well, 2x plus y is going to
be a more negative number,

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.740
because both of these are
negative numbers.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.170
So when you add them, you're
going to get something even

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.920
more negative than
either of them.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.290
Then we take the negative of
that, you get a larger

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.610
positive number.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.400
That last explanation might
have been confusing.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.670
And really, the easiest way is
just pick some numbers that

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.250
satisfy this inequality.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.440
And then substitute, and then
you have your answer.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.830
All right.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:10.090
Number 13, which I'll do
in this pale yellow.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.060
Carlos delivered n packages
on Monday.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.550
So Monday, n.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.170
4 times as many packages on
Tuesday as on Monday.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.160
So on Tuesday, he did 4 times
as many, so that's 4n.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.180
And 3 more-- not 3 times, 3
more-- packages on Wednesday

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.720
than Monday.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.700
So Wednesday, 3 more packages
on Wednesday than Monday.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.810
So this is n plus 3, 3
more than on Monday.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.590
What is the average number of
packages he delivered per day

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.940
over the three days?

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.190
So what's the average of
these three numbers?

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.830
So let's see.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.080
We sum them up.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.640
n plus 4n plus n plus 3, and
we divide by 3, because

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.620
there's three days.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.120
n plus 4n is 5n, plus
3 is 6n. you 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.990
So it's 6n plus 3 over 3.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.180
Divide all the terms by 3,
that equals 2n plus 1.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.500
And we are done.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.895
That was number 13,
which was C.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:27.490
Number 14.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.260
This looks exciting.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:45.020
a plus b to the 1/2 is equal to
a minus b to the minus 1/2.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.780
Which of the following
must be true?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.160
And they say, b is equal to 0.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.830
That's choice A.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.160
They say a plus b
is equal to 1.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.290
a minus b is equal to 1.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.880
a squared plus b squared
is equal to 1.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.910
a squared minus b squared
is equal to 1.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.500
Well, what I want to do is, I
just want to write this in a

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.300
form that makes more
sense to me.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.870
So this is essentially saying
the square root of a plus b is

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:22.780
equal to 1 over the square
root of a minus b.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.630
Right?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.640
Negative 1/2.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.840
So let's multiply both sides
of this equation times the

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.970
square root of a minus b.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.770
This side will just
cancel out, right?

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.440
And you're just left with 1.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.320
This is the same thing as the
square root of a minus b

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.562
times a plus b.

00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:49.830
Right?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.360
And then on the right-hand
side, we're

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.990
just left with a 1.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.300
And what's a minus
b times a plus b?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.350
So this is the square root of
a squared minus b squared is

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.600
equal to 1.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.080
We could square both
sides, right?

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.560
So if we square both sides, so
we take both to the second

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.710
power, what are we left with?

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.890
This radical sign goes away, so
we're left with a squared

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.650
minus b squared is equal to 1.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.190
And that is choice E.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.700
Let's see.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.995
Do I have time to do
the next problem?

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:31.570
It looks complicated.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.110
So let me wait to do the next
problem in the next video.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.360
