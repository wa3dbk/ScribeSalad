00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.850
In the last video, we visualized
an ethane molecule

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.890
with a Newman Projection.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.820
What I want to do in this video
is show that you can

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.120
really visualize longer chains,
or even, we'll see in

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.500
future videos, even cyclical,
ring-based carbon molecules

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.240
with Newman Projections
as well.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.860
And I guess the next most
complex molecule to study

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.220
would be butane.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.520
We could do propane, but butane
will be interesting.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.650
This was ethane right here,
butane will have four carbons.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.070
And if I were to draw it in
kind of a ball and stick

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.800
model, it would look like
something like this.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
So this would be one
carbon right there.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.470
Then you would have another
carbon right over there, and

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.930
another carbon right
over there.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410
And then you'd have your
fourth carbon.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.150
And then your hydrogens.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.210
You would have a hydrogen coming
out like this, like

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.420
that, and then up like that.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.450
This guy would have two
hydrogens that would

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.920
stick out like that.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.670
This guy would have
two hydrogens that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.330
stick out like that.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.370
And then finally this guy will
also have three hydrogens, the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.540
ch3, just like that.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.430
Now, if we try to draw a Newman
Projection, here's

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.970
like, well, what do you consider
the front, or the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.690
back, carbon in all of that.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.950
And you actually can pick.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.540
And what's interesting in a
butane molecule is, if you

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.830
pick this guy, so this is a one,
two, three, four carbon,

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.970
if you pick the two carbon as
our front, and our three

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.360
carbon as our back, and then we
viewed this carbon, the ch3

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.610
as kind of one of the add-ons
on to that carbon, you can

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.965
then do a Newman Projection.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:37.080
So let's try to do this.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.660
So this'll be the front one.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.370
So we'll put this carbon in the
front, and we'll put this

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.220
carbon over here, we'll
put this carbon

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.770
over here in the back.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.530
And before I even draw the
Newman Projection, let me

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.650
redraw this.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.660
But I'm just going to draw
this, instead of with the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.340
hydrogens, the bonds, explicitly
defined, I'm just

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.000
going to call this a ch3.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.680
So let me redraw this.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.440
So I'll do this in orange.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.970
So you have this carbon.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.580
I'll do this as kind of as a
modified ball and stick.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.670
So that carbon, it has a
hydrogen, it has that hydrogen

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.480
and that hydrogen.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.120
And instead of drawing this out,
I'm going to just draw

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.670
this whole thing right here and
I'll do it in, I'll do it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.730
in magenta.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.110
I'm going to draw this whole
thing as just a ch3.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.060
So I'm going to draw this whole
thing as just a ch3.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.170
So I'll draw it really big,
because it's not just one

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.700
atom, it's four atoms.
So this is our ch3.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.820
And, well, to do ball and stick
everything really should

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.430
be a ball, so I'll draw a ball
there, a ball there.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.510
So that's our carbon number two,
and then it has this bond

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.500
over here to this carbon
number three.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.070
Which, when we do our
Newman Projection,

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.560
we'll put in the back.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.130
So our carbon number
three is like that.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.110
And then the carbon number
three, it has two hydrogens,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620
and then it has this.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.940
You can kind of view it as this
methyl group attached to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.570
it, if you want.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.250
It has this ch3 attached
to it right there.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.820
So I'll do the ch3, I'll do
it in this blue color.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.590
And so we could draw
it like this.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.710
So the ch3 is coming off-- so
I'll draw it really big

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.600
because it's not
just one atom.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.280
So it's a ch3.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.910
And then you have your two
hydrogens and they're-- sorry,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.120
you have your two hydrogens
down here.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.580
So let me be very clear here.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.120
This hydrogen and that hydrogen,
that's that hydrogen

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.100
and that hydrogen, this thing
here is that thing there.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.820
That big ball right there
is this whole ball.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.980
And then let me find
a-- I'll do green.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.630
This hydrogen and this hydrogen
is this hydrogen and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.780
this hydrogen.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.730
And when you look at it this
way, now you say, oh, now I

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.450
can see how I would draw
a Newman Projection.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.530
I put this in the front,
that in the back.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.810
I treat this whole part of
the molecule as just a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.810
group, if you will.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.890
It is a group.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.300
So lets do the Newman
Projection here.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.910
And we can think about where
it's most stable.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.279
So the way I've drawn it right
here-- I'll do this as the

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.940
front, this carbon
two is going to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.300
be the front molecule.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.540
So you have the ch3
group going down.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.550
And then you have these
two hydrogens,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.240
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.930
That's the front.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.080
And in the back you have
this blue one.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.510
You can imagine in the front, if
we want to, maybe I'll do a

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.350
little small orange
thing to show this

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.700
is the orange carbon.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.520
And then the blue carbon is
going to be in the back.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.490
The blue carbon is in the back,
I'll draw it like this.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.680
So that's my blue carbon.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.230
The way we've done it here, we
have a ch3 pointing straight

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.130
up, and then we have
our two hydrogens.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.280
Now, just like we talked about
in the first video on Newman

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.220
Projections, all of these groups
have-- these hydrogens

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.820
have electron clouds
around them.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.120
This whole ch3 group has
a larger electron

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.780
cloud around it.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.740
It's a carbon atom
plus hydrogens.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.220
They all want to get away
from each other.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.380
The ch3 is even a
bigger molecule.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.630
So to some degree, it's going
to play a bigger role in

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.220
whether something has a higher
or lower potential energy or

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:26.640
whether it's wound or not.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.040
So I guess the most obvious, or
maybe it's not obvious, but

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.780
the ch3 groups, since they
have the biggest electron

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.200
crowd, they're kind of crowding
the molecule.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.046
This ch3 group and this ch3
group, they're going to want

00:05:39.046 --> 00:05:41.680
to get as far away from each
other as possible.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.430
So the way we did this, it
looks kind of like our

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.890
staggered conformation, but when
we're dealing with actual

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.970
methyl groups that are separated
as far as they can

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.410
from each other, we
call this the

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.360
anti-conformation right here.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.870
And if we think about dihedral
angles between the two methyl

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.975
groups, the dihedral angle
here is 180 degrees.

00:06:11.975 --> 00:06:14.450
180 degrees dihedral angle.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.370
And this is the lowest
potential

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.150
energy or the most stable.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.120
And if that confuses you when I
talk about lowest potential

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.180
energy, just think about it.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.380
A rock on the ground has a lower
potential energy than a

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.850
rock that is 50 feet
in the air.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.100
A rock on the ground is
also more stable.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.490
It's less likely to
do something.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.040
Something 50 feet in the air,
maybe if you nudge it a little

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.980
bit, it'll fall off the cliff
or wherever it is.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.210
Or maybe it's already falling.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.580
Who knows?

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.750
It's going to move when you have
higher potential energy.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.950
Or it takes very little for
it to release energy.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.670
But when you have
lower potential

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.810
energy, you're more stable.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.060
So this is the most stable
conformation.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.110
Now what are the other
situations you could do here?

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.050
Well, you could keep rotating
these-- let's say we rotated

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.590
the back carbon around
clockwise, what are the other

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.310
conformations we could get?

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.700
And so let me just draw the
front portion right here.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:17.210
So you have your ch3, and then
you have your two hydrogens,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.395
hydrogen, and hydrogen.

00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:21.860
And let me copy and
paste this.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.160
So there's two other real-- I
mean, there's everything in

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.640
between, but these are the ones
that are interesting.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:34.430
Control copy, and then let me
copy it, copy, and then paste.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.670
So I'll actually draw
three of these.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.950
So then you have that.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.230
Then let me paste it one more
time, and then you have that.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.250
So obviously this would
be the front

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.330
carbon in every situation.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.755
If I want I could make it a
little orange dot to show that

00:07:51.755 --> 00:07:53.870
that's the front carbon.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.340
And then let me draw
the back carbon.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.130
I should've copied and
pasted this as well.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.325
So you have your back carbon
in every situation.

00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:07.150
Now, if we were to rotate this
character by 60 degrees--

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.880
actually if we were to rotate
the back by 60 degrees, what

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.100
would it look like?

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.660
Well, then we would have-- this
hydrogen would move up

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.300
there-- so then you would
have this hydrogen.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.220
Actually if we were to move it
by 120 degrees, I should say.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.650
This would be 60, and then
another 120 degrees.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.240
So this hydrogen would
go up there.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:37.299
This methyl group would now be
over here, and then this

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.440
hydrogen would go over here.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.550
So we've just rotated to this
whole thing by 120 degrees.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.020
Now, this conformation,
this was called the

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.060
anti-conformation.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.530
It's the most stable because
the carbon-- the methyl

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.300
groups, are as far away from
each other as possible.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.110
This right here is called
the Gauche conformation.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:04.590
Let me do this in a different--
and you can view

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.460
this as the second
most stable.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.720
At least the methyls
are staggered.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.470
They're not directly
behind each other.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.540
So here the methyls are
as far apart from

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.450
each other as possible.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.560
If you look at the ball and
stick model, I actually drew

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.140
it in that conformation
right here.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.650
They're as far apart
from each other.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.170
If you were to flip this
molecule, if you were to flip

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.570
it, this methyl would get closer
to this methyl, and

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.440
their electron clouds would
start to crowd each other.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.270
So in this situation this
is anti, most stable.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.960
If you rotate a little bit
they'll get a little bit

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.360
closer but they'll still
be staggered.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.180
You get the Gauche
conformation.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:42.070
Now, if we rotate this, if we
rotate the back guy now 60

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:48.350
degrees clockwise, what's
going to happen?

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.410
Well, then you're going to have
an eclipsed conformation,

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.320
where the carbons are directly,
but where the methyl

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.240
groups are directly
behind each other.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.110
And that's going to be your
least stable situation.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.430
Right?

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.380
So you'd have this guy-- and
I'll draw it slightly-- so

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.950
you'd have this guy, ch3 there,
and then you would have

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.720
your hydrogens that are right
behind each other.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.000
So a hydrogen and a hydrogen.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.600
So in this situation where
eclipsed-- this is the least

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.080
stable, and also the most
potential energy.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.160
And then if we were to go
another 60 degrees from this,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.990
then we'd go to another
Gauche conformation.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.430
If you rotate this another 60
degrees, then you'd have a ch3

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.750
here, and then you would have--
this hydrogen would be

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.730
up here, and then this
hydrogen here.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.120
So this is staggered.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.670
The methyl groups are, at least
they're not directly

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.990
behind each other, but they're
not as far as they could be if

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.060
we were to rotate another 120
degrees and get to the

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.460
anti-conformation.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.520
So this one right here is also
a Gauche conformation.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.020
So hopefully you understand
now that, you just have to

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.030
pick two carbons and then you
can, if there's, kind of, big

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.180
things attached to each of those
carbons, you can just

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.850
represent them as groups.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.650
And when you do that-- you'd
use a Newman Projection for

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.400
any part of a molecule.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.570
And when you do that, you can
start to think about how it

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.490
can rotate and what parts, or
what versions of it, will be--
