00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.480
I just had dinner so I am well
fed, and I am ready to do more

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.100
SAT problems. So we're on
section seven, on page--

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.660
excuse me, maybe I should
drink some more water--

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.940
section seven of the
sixth test, on page

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.890
733, problem one.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.110
In a certain game, points are
assigned to every word.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.740
Each q, x and z in a word-- it
sounds like Scrabble-- is

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.420
worth 5 points.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.840
And all other letters are
worth 1 point each.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.320
So q, x and z are 5 points each,
and the other ones are 1

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.840
point each.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.320
What is the sum of the points

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.970
assigned to the word exquisite?

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.070
Well this is just-- exquisite.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.190
So let's see, which of
these does it have?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.420
It has an x, right?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.920
So that's worth 5 points.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.030
Does it have any
other of these?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.200
No-- well, it has a q, right?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.190
That's worth 5 points.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.830
It doesn't have a z, right?

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.440
And so how many one-pointers
are there?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.390
There's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.930
So 7 one-pointers.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.050
So that's 7 points, plus 5 plus
5 plus 10 is equal to 17.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.700
So that's B.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.680
So that's really just to make
sure that you don't make

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.030
careless mistakes,
that problem.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.950
Next problem.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.230
If you've ever played Scrabble,
that problem would

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.010
be a joke for you.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.060
Problem two.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.965
If 2x minus 10 is equal to 20,
then x minus 5 is what?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.510
So the big discovery here is--
you could solve for x, you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.210
could say 2x is equal to 30, x
is equal to 15, and say 15

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.660
minus 5 equals 10.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.920
Or you could say, well this is
the same thing as 2 times x

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.960
minus 10 is equal to 20, divide
both sides by 2, x

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.490
minus 10 is equal to 10.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.550
Oh, sorry, maybe that's why you
shouldn't do it this way.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.040
2 times x minus 5, x minus
5 is equal to 10.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.700
So that's the other way you
could have done it, you just

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.690
factor out a 2, you get 2 times
x minus 5 is 20, divide

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.000
both sides by 2, you get
x minus 5 is 10.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.910
The other way is obviously
to say 2x minus

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.680
10 is equal to 20.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.760
Add 10 to both sides.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.010
2x is equal to 30.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.570
x is equal to 15.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.930
So then x minus 5 is 15 minus
5, which is equal to 10.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.510
I don't know which way might
be faster for you.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.730
This way might-- you have to do
less thinking, and you just

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.837
kind of chug through
it, so you can just

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:39.700
kind of speed along.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.510
But this way's a few less steps,
but maybe you might

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.130
make a careless mistake
like what I just did.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.120
But anyway, let's move on.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.230
Hopefully, either way you
know how to do it.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.520
Problem three.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.120
I'll do it right here.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.360
If t represents an odd
integer, which of the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.270
following represents
an even integer?

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.960
So t is an odd integer.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.360
And we can do this kind of
abstractly, but let's just

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.600
pick a number.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.280
Let's just say that t is equal
to-- what's an odd integer?

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.120
Well, 3, 3 is an odd integer.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.050
So let's just say t equals 3--
they didn't say, we could have

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.700
picked t equals 7, who knows.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.250
So then just go through the
choices and say, well, which

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.840
one of those is going to
be an even integer?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.820
Choice A is t plus 2.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.800
Well 3 plus 2 is 5, that is
still odd, so that's not the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.980
right answer.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.960
B, 2t minus 1.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.980
Well that's 6 minus 1,
that's 5, that's odd.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:44.800
Choice C is 3t minus 2, that's
9 minus 2, which is still 7,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.380
so that's still odd.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.700
Choice D is 3t plus 2,
that's 9 plus 2,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.090
which is equal to 11.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.710
And I'm just saying t is 3.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.690
That's still odd.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.700
So it's probably
going to be E.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.690
5t plus 1, and 15 plus 1
is 16, and that's even.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.280
So that's our answer.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.160
So sometimes I find it easy
if you just pick a number.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.110
The other way is if you are
familiar with even and odd

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.339
numbers, you can just say, well,
the only way to go from

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:27.050
an odd to an even number, is you
either have to multiply by

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.140
an even soon. number, or
add an odd number.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.960
Those are the only ways you can
go from an odd number to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.260
an even number.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.570
So looking at 5t plus 1, you
could say, well when I

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.990
multiply an odd number by an odd
number, I'm going to get

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.190
another odd number, right?

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.470
So this number is odd.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.850
When I take an odd number
and I add 1 to it,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.560
I get an even number.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.830
So you could say 5t plus
1 is definitely going

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.800
to be an even number.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.300
And it worked with the odd
number that we picked for t.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.550
Next problem.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.466
OK, so they drew
a picture here.

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:20.270
So I will draw a picture
here as best as I can.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.670
That's one triangle they drew,
this is the other one.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.110
Looks something like this.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.500
Like that.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.160
And then this-- they say
this is A, B, C.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.200
This is D, E, F.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.100
These sides are 4, 8, and 9.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.870
Now what are they saying?

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.850
For the triangles above, the
perimeter of ABC equals the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:53.880
perimeter of DEF.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.340
OK, it equals that.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.810
If ABC is equilateral, what
is the length of AB?

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.040
OK, so it's equilateral,
right?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.390
So let's just say that
AB is equal to x.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.180
Well then, so is BC and AC,
because they told us, this is

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.350
an equilateral triangle.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.330
All the sides are equal.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.430
And what is the perimeter
of ABC then?

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.350
It's going to be x plus x plus
x, and that's just 3x.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.270
And they say that that's the
same thing as the perimeter of

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.620
this triangle.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.520
What's the perimeter
of this triangle?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.110
It's 4 plus 8 plus 9.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.750
So 3x is equal to--what's
12 plus 9-- is 21.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.150
x is equal to 7, and that is
choice C, and we are done.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.400
Next problem.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.100
They have drawn a diagram
here that I will

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.790
now attempt to draw.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.550
OK.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.316
And then, let's see they draw
a dividing line, looks like

00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:52.690
it's about 1/4 of the circle.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.880
And then they have another one
that's like a little less than

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.660
1/4, like that.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.820
Then they have one that's
like that, roughly.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.565
Then it goes like that.

00:07:05.565 --> 00:07:07.640
Then it goes like that.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.240
And then they fill in
the values too.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.480
So this is K, it's 15%.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.420
J is 25%.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.630
O-- let's just call
that other, is O.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.570
Other is 20%.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.410
N is 10%.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:35.090
M is 15% and L is 15%.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.380
And these are sales of jeans in
2001, and the letters are

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.370
the brands.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.740
The circle graph above
represents all the jeans that

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.950
were sold by a retail
store in 2001

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.070
according to their brands.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.480
If the store sold 900 pairs of
jeans-- so this is the total

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.050
of all of these, is 900
pairs of jeans.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.620
If the store sold 900 pairs of
jeans other than brands J, K,

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.930
L, M and N, how may did
it sell together?

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.600
OK, so this isn't the total,
this is the other.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.320
This is essentially this
category, right?

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.220
And other is equal to
20% of the total.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.370
And that's what they
want to ask us, how

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.030
many did we sell together?

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:22.160
So 20% of the total times t for
total-- let me just say t

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.200
for total-- is equal to 900.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.840
And you could also write
this as 1/5.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.790
Or 0.2.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.320
1/5 of the total is
equal to 900.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.490
Multiply both sides by 5.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.330
That cancels out.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.839
So you get t is equal to
4,500 pairs of jeans.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:45.830
And that is choice E.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.310
Next problem.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.220
Oh, I thought this problem might
apply to this pie graph,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.985
but no, they're talking about
carpets, not jeans.

00:08:51.985 --> 00:08:53.950
So I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.730
I'll see you
