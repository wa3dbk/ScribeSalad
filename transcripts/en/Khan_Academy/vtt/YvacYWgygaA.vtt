00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome back.
Welcome back.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.540
I'll now do another conservation
of energy

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.110
problem, and this time I'll
add another twist. So far,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.530
everything we've been doing,
energy was conserved by the

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.970
law of conservation.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.740
But that's because all of the
forces that were acting in

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.810
these systems were conservative
forces.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.750
And now I'll introduce you to
a problem that has a little

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810
bit of friction, and we'll see
that some of that energy gets

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.720
lost to friction.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.340
And we can think about
it a little bit.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.470
Well where does that
energy go?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.980
And I'm getting this problem
from the University of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.230
Oregon's zebu.uoregon.edu.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.990
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.590
And they seem to have some nice
physics problems, so I'll

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.120
use theirs.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.530
And I just want to make
sure they get credit.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.860
So let's see.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.910
They say a 90 kilogram
bike and rider.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.725
So the bike and rider combined
are 90 kilograms. So let's

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:45.920
just say the mass is 90
kilograms. Start at rest from

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840
the top of a 500 meter
long hill.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.860
OK, so I think they mean
that the hill is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.710
something like this.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.550
So if this is the hill, that
the hypotenuse here is 500

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.270
hundred meters long.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.160
So the length of that,
this is 500 meters.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.420
A 500 meter long hill with
a 5 degree incline.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.670
So this is 5 degrees.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.370
And we can kind of just view
it like a wedge, like we've

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.070
done in other problems.
There you go.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.890
That's pretty straight.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.550
OK.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.050
Assuming an average friction
force of 60 newtons.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.490
OK, so they're not telling us
the coefficient of friction

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.580
and then we have to figure
out the normal

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.620
force and all of that.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.630
They're just telling us, what
is the drag of friction?

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.430
Or how much is actually friction
acting against this

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.750
rider's motion?

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.360
We could think a little bit
about where that friction is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.880
coming from.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.660
So the force of friction is
equal to 60 newtons And of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.030
course, this is going to be
going against his motion or

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.040
her motion.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.150
And the question asks us, find
the speed of the biker at the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.110
bottom of the hill.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.510
So the biker starts up
here, stationary.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.240
That's the biker.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.560
My very artful rendition
of the biker.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.230
And we need to figure out the
velocity at the bottom.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.920
This to some degree is a
potential energy problem.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.380
 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.790
It's definitely a conservation
of mechanical energy problem.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.610
So let's figure out what the
energy of the system is when

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.550
the rider starts off.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.360
So the rider starts off at
the top of this hill.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.930
So definitely some
potential energy.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.850
And is stationary, so there's
no kinetic energy.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.760
So all of the energy is
potential, and what is the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.600
potential energy?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.030
Well potential energy is equal
to mass times the acceleration

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.950
of gravity times
height, right?

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.300
Well that's equal to, if the
mass is 90, the acceleration

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.830
of gravity is 9.8 meters
per second squared.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.540
And then what's the height?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.960
Well here we're going to have
to break out a little

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.810
trigonometry.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.010
We need to figure out this side
of this triangle, if you

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.270
consider this whole
thing a triangle.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.630
Let's see.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.080
We want to figure out
the opposite.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.630
We know the hypotenuse and
we know this angle here.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.920
So the sine of this angle is
equal to opposite over

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.440
hypotenuse.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.680
So, SOH.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.910
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.490
So we know that the height--
so let me do a little work

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.010
here-- we know that sine of
5 degrees is equal to

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.510
the height over 500.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.420
Or that the height is equal
to 500 sine of 5 degrees.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.470
And I calculated the sine of
5 degrees ahead of time.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.380
Let me make sure I
still have it.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.820
That's cause I didn't have my
calculator with me today.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.290
But you could do this
on your own.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.400
So this is equal to 500,
and the sine of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.806
5 degrees is 0.087.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.870
So when you multiply these
out, what do I get?

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.220
I'm using the calculator
on Google actually.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.400
500 times sine.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.670
You get 43.6.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.900
So this is equal to 43.6.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.970
So the height of the hill
is 43.6 meters.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.390
So going back to the potential
energy, we have the mass times

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.850
the acceleration of gravity
times the height.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.740
Times 43.6.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.290
And this is equal to, and then
I can use just my regular

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.640
calculator since I don't
have to figure out

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.090
trig functions anymore.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:25.380
So 90-- so you can see the whole
thing-- times 9.8 times

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:34.860
43.6 is equal to, let's
see, roughly 38,455.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.180
So this is equal to 38,455
joules or newton meters.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.270
And that's a lot of
potential energy.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.980
So what happens?

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.690
At the bottom of the hill--
sorry, I have to readjust my

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.070
chair-- at the bottom of the
hill, all of this gets

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.590
converted to, or maybe I should

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.260
pose that as a question.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.450
Does all of it get converted
to kinetic energy?

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.560
Almost. We have a force
of friction here.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.880
And friction, you can kind of
view friction as something

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.120
that eats up mechanical
energy.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.250
These are also called
nonconservative forces because

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.590
when you have these forces
at play, all of the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.580
force is not conserved.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.160
So a way to think about it is,
is that the energy, let's just

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.430
call it total energy.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:30.670
So let's say total energy
initial, well let me just

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:40.740
write initial energy is equal
to the energy wasted in

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:51.870
friction-- I should have written
just letters-- from

00:05:51.870 --> 00:06:00.170
friction plus final energy.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.670
So we know what the initial
energy is in this system.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.120
That's the potential energy
of this bicyclist and this

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.730
roughly 38 and 1/2 kilojoules
or 38,500 joules, roughly.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.530
And now let's figure out the
energy wasted from friction,

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.110
and the energy wasted from
friction is the negative work

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.850
that friction does.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.470
And what does negative
work mean?

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.000
Well the bicyclist is moving 500
meters in this direction.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.740
So distance is 500 meters.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.050
But friction isn't acting
along the same

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.290
direction as distance.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.470
The whole time, friction is
acting against the distance.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.690
So when the force is going in
the opposite direction as the

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.430
distance, your work
is negative.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.440
 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.500
So another way of thinking of
this problem is energy initial

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:56.420
is equal to, or you could say
the energy initial plus the

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.370
negative work of friction,
right?

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.090
If we say that this is a
negative quantity, then this

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.730
is equal to the final energy.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.920
And here, I took the friction
and put it on the other side

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.410
because I said this is going to
be a negative quantity in

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.290
the system.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.680
And so you should always just
make sure that if you have

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.770
friction in the system, just as
a reality check, that your

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.100
final energy is less than
your initial energy.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:25.500
Our initial energy is, let's
just say 38.5 kilojoules.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.290
What is the negative work
that friction is doing?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.530
Well it's 500 meters.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.600
And the entire 500 meters, it's
always pushing back on

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.420
the rider with a force
of 60 newtons.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.960
So force times distance.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.690
So it's minus 60 newtons,
cause it's going in the

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.530
opposite direction of the
motion, times 500.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.000
And this is going to equal
the ending, oh, no.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.460
This is going to equal the
final energy, right?

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.030
And what is this?

00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:00.100
60 times 500, that's 3,000.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.190
No, 30,000, right.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.975
So let's subtract 30,000
from 38,500.

00:08:04.975 --> 00:08:06.490
So let's see.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.580
Minus 30.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.460
I didn't have to do that.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.780
I could have done
that in my head.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:19.990
So that gives us 8,455 joules is
equal to the final energy.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.820
And what is all the
final energy?

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.530
Well by this time, the rider's
gotten back to, I guess we

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.410
could call the sea level.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.890
So all of the energy
is now going to be

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.930
kinetic energy, right?

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.510
What's the formula for
kinetic energy?

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:35.059
It's 1/2 mv squared.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.580
And we know what m is.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.126
The mass of the rider is 90.

00:08:38.126 --> 00:08:42.480
So we have this is 90.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.610
So if we divide both sides.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.850
So the 1/2 times 90.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.160
That's 45.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.140
So 8,455 divided by 45.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:59.540
So we get v squared
is equal to 187.9.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.500
And let's take the square root
of that and we get the

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.690
velocity, 13.7.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.340
So if we take the square root of
both sides of this, so the

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.900
final velocity is 13.7.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.270
I know you can't read that.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.510
13.7 meters per second.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.960
And this was a slightly more
interesting problem because

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.480
here we had the energy wasn't
completely conserved.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.460
Some of the energy, you could
say, was eaten by friction.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.700
And actually that energy
just didn't

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.080
disappear into a vacuum.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.860
It was actually generated
into heat.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.490
And it makes sense.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.930
If you slid down a slide of
sandpaper, your pants would

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.750
feel very warm by the time you
got to the bottom of that.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.400
But the friction of this, they
weren't specific on where the

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.420
friction came from, but it
could have come from the

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420
gearing within the bike.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.550
It could have come
from the wind.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.470
Maybe the bike actually
skidded a little

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.280
bit on the way down.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.190
I don't know.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.290
But hopefully you found that
a little bit interesting.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.230
And now you can not only work
with conservation of

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.950
mechanical energy, but you can
work problems where there's a

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:01.820
little bit of friction
involved as well.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.380
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.630
