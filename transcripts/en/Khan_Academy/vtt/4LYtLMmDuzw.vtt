00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.290
They want us to subtract these
two numbers and simplify the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.040
answer and write as
a mixed number.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.370
We're going to do it two ways.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.150
The first way, we're going to
turn both of these into

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.650
improper fractions and
see what we get.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.850
And then the other way, we're
going to subtract the whole

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.740
number parts and then subtract
the fraction parts and see

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.690
what we get.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.420
So if we turn them both into
improper fractions, let's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.070
first turn 8 and 2/3 into
an improper fraction.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.380
So it has 3 in the
denominator, and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.940
3 times 8 is 24.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.210
24 plus 2 is 26.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.760
So 8 and 2/3 is the same
thing as 26/3.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.490
And 5 and 5/6, so we're
going to subtract.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.200
We're going to have 6
in the denominator.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.130
6 times 5 is 30.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.420
30 plus 5 is 35.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.990
So this simplifies as an
improper fraction to 35/6.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.610
Now to subtract, we have to
have a common denominator.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.420
3 and 6 are not the same
denominator, but they are both

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.830
divisible into 6.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.280
6 is the least common
multiple of 3 and 6.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.590
So let's turn them both
into something over 6.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.390
So the 26/3, if we put it over
6, to go from 3 to 6 in the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.730
denominator, we have to multiply
by 2, so we have to

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.240
do the same thing in
the numerator.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.220
We have to multiply 2 times
26, which is 52.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.300
So it's going to be 52/6 minus--
we don't have to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.920
change this one here
in orange.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.890
It's already over 6-- minus
36/6, which is going to be

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.170
equal to-- what's 52 minus 35?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.760
Let's see, if you add 5
to 35, you get to 40.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.980
15 will get you to 50, and
so we want 2 more, so

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.310
it's going to be 17.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.670
So it's 17/6.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.730
This is as an improper
fraction.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.590
Now, if we want to write it as
a mixed number, we say how

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.910
many times does 6 go into 17?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.900
Well, 6 times 2 is 12,
so that works.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.210
6 times 3 is too big.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.990
It's 18, so it goes
in two times.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.110
Now, if you take it into it
two times, you get 12, and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.890
then you have 5 left
over, right?

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.610
To go from 12 to 17, you need
5 so you have 5 left over.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.669
You could say 6 goes into 17 two
times, remainder 5, so 17

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.600
over 6 is 2 and 5/6.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.500
And we're done!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.620
Now this is kind of the improper
fraction route, which

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.160
it'll always work.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.940
It'll always work.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.260
Sometimes it's easier
or harder, but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.060
it will always work.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.570
Actually, either route will
always work, but I tend to do

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.940
it this way.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.910
Let's do it separating out
the whole number and the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.260
fractional parts.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.886
So first we could view
this as 8 minus 5.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:34.940
So let's do this.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.180
8 minus 5-- that's subtracting
the whole number parts-- plus

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.780
2/3 minus 5/6.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.300
Now, 8 minus 5, that's easy.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.700
That's 3.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.210
And then over here, though, we
have an interesting-- well,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.800
let's try to work it out.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.980
Let me do this in a
different color.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.820
We want a common denominator
here, and we already saw that

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.520
6 is the least common multiple
of 3 and 5, so we could write

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.110
them both with 6 as
the denominator.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.830
5/6 already has 6 as
the denominator.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.930
We don't have to do
anything there.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.380
To go from 3 to 6 in the
denominator here, we have to

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.090
multiply by 2, so let's do the
same thing with this 2.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.670
2 times 2 is 4.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.270
So this results in 4/6 minus
5/6, which will give us-- and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.930
we haven't covered it yet--
a negative number.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.780
If you take 5 from 4, you're
going to go below 0.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.620
Now, if we don't want to deal
with that negative number,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.600
what we could do, and this is
essentially the same idea as

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.260
regrouping or borrowing,
although they shouldn't call

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.380
it borrowing, they should call
it taking, is we can

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.560
rewrite this 3.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.110
That's why this can get a little
bit tricky sometimes.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.060
Let me do it over here.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.790
Let me draw a line here so we
don't get the two ways of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.160
doing the problem confused.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.820
We can rewrite the 3 as 2 plus
1, but instead of writing it

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.120
as 1, we could write
it as 6/6, right?

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.830
6 over 6 is 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.500
And then, if we add it
to these guys, so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.250
plus 4/6 minus 5/6.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.130
Now, what happened
by doing that?

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.530
Well, if we throw this 6/6 into
the mix and then we had

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.970
the 4/6 and then we subtract
the 5 from it, then we're

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.250
going to have a positive number,
so let's to do it.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.110
So we get this 2 right here.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:30.550
So it's 2 plus, and then over
6, we have 6 plus 4--

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.120
let me write it.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.140
6 plus 4 minus 5.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.610
Now, what's this
going to equal?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.955
This is going to be this
2 and what over 6?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.070
6 plus 4 is 10 minus 5 is 5.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.870
So you have 2 and 5/6, which
is exactly what we

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.130
got the other way.
