00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.220
Let's say we're in R2.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.130
Let me graph it.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.085
Let me draw my vertical
axis, just like that.

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:09.220
And then let me draw
my horizontal

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.870
axis, just like that.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:20.890
And let's say I have
a vector 1, 2.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.610
So my vector looks like this,
1, and then we go up 2.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.230
So my vector looks like this.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.110
Let me draw it.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.370
That is my vector.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.080
It's the vector 1, 2.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.650
And I want to look at
the line that is

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.200
spanned by this vector.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.340
So let me just define some line
L, and it's equal to the

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.850
set of t times 1, 2, where
t is any real number.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.930
So this is just a line with
a slope of 2, right?

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.185
You rise 2 for every
1 you go over.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.270
So let me draw my line
just like this.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.520
There's nothing new
at this point.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.220
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.569
There you go.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.230
And it keeps going, because
obviously, you could get

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.150
negative multiples of my vector,
and it also goes here.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.230
If you look at all the points
that are specified by all of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.750
the scaled up or scaled down or
negative scaled versions of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.880
this vector, you're going to
get all the points on this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.640
line if you draw those vectors
in standard position.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.540
So this is my line
right there.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.050
Now, I want to construct a
linear transformation that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.730
reflects around this line.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.660
For example, if I have
this vector-- let me

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.570
draw it like this.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.480
Let's say I have that vector
that specifies that point

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.710
right there.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.490
Let me call that vector x.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.770
I want the transformation of
x to be essentially the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.540
reflection of x around
this line.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.410
So if I go in this direction
right here, I want this to be

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.520
the transformation.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.885
I want that to be the
transformation of x, so it

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:57.300
should look just like that.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.840
I'll do another example.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.935
Let's say I have this vector.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.250
Let me give you a particular
vector.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.229
Let's say I have a vector that's
orthogonal to my line.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.039
So let's say I have the vector,
I'll call it v1.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.150
And let's see, something that's
orthogonal to it, I can

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.750
switch these two guys and make
one of them negative.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.040
So if I go to the vector 2,
minus 1, so if I have this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.850
vector right here, visually
it looks orthogonal.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.380
So if I have v2-- let
me call it v1.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.780
v1 is equal to 2 minus 1.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.700
Visually, it looks orthogonal,
but then even if you actually

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.670
take the dot product 2 times 1
plus minus 1 times 2, that's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.270
going to be equal to 0.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.450
So this is definitely orthogonal
to my spanning

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.290
vector, so it's definitely
orthogonal to every

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.560
point on that line.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.820
But if I apply the
transformation to this guy

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.130
right here, I'm just going
to flip it over the line.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.240
So let me draw it like this.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.160
So it's going to be equal to--
it's just going to look like--

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.300
let me do it in a green color.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.360
So the transformation of this
guy, I'm just flipping him

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.030
over this line.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.060
I'm finding the reflection
across line L.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.360
So this is going to be the
transformation of v1, and it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.430
would be-- we don't know what
the actual transformation

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.340
matrix is and that's actually
going to be the subject of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.000
this video, but if you just
look at the transformation

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.570
just for v1, it's going to be
the negative of that, so it's

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.770
going to be minus 2, 1.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.550
So I know I want to define
this transformation.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.240
I know I want to define this
transformation from R2 to R2.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240
That is a reflection.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:53.070
So the transformation of some
vector x is the reflection of

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.770
x around or across, or however
you want to describe it,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.660
around line L, around L.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.470
Now, in the past, if we wanted
to find the transformation

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.033
matrix-- we know this is a
linear transformation.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.430
I don't have to go through all
of the exercise of this is a

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.580
linear transformation.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.380
But in the past, if we wanted
to find the transformation

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.370
matrix for a linear
transformation, let's say we

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.130
say T of x is equal to some
2-by-2 matrix, because it's a

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.590
mapping from R2 to R2 times x.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.110
Before in the past to find A, we
would say A is equal to the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.180
transformation applied to our
first standard basis vector,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.040
so the transformation
applied to 1, 0.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.180
And then our second column in A
would be the transformation

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.750
applied to 0, 1.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.690
And if we were dealing in Rn,
we would do this n times and

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.420
we would have the
n basis vectors.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.940
We've seen this multiple,
multiple times.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.290
Now, in the past, when we
were constructing these

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.440
transformation matrices, finding
these things were

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.300
pretty straightforward, but
you'll see now it's not that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.010
straightforward.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.620
If I have 1, 0, if I have the
vector 1, 0, finding its

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.380
transformation, if I were to
flip it over, it's going to

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.310
look something like this.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.440
And we could do it if we were
creative with our geometry and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.260
our trigonometry.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.860
We could actually figure this
number out, and we could

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.910
figure this number out.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.130
If I were to flip 0, 1
over, it might look

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.110
something like that.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.975
We could figure it out,
but it's not easy.

00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:33.120
So let me just write
this down.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.110
It's not easy.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.220
And we want to at least-- I
mean, you know, we could do

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.340
this if we had to, but if
there's an easier way, we

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.570
should at least be exposed
to that easier way.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.500
So you might have
an insight here.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.670
We've been talking about
alternate coordinate systems,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.690
and this transformation, it
looks difficult in our

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.870
standard coordinate system,
because we're reflecting

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.010
around this line right there.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.410
But what if we defined a
coordinate system where

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.490
reflection around this line
was more natural?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.610
And you might already see an
interesting coordinate system.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.430
What if we had a coordinate
system with v1 as one of the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.040
basis vectors and then 1, 2
as the other basis vector?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.180
Then, all of a sudden, at
least in that coordinate

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.340
system, the reflection wouldn't
be around this

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.220
inclined line.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.550
The reflection would be around
the second coordinate's axis.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.710
It seems like it would be a more
natural transformation.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.240
So this leads us to a very
interesting thing.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.390
Let me review what we've done in
the last couple of videos.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.020
In the last couple of videos,
we could say, look, if we're

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.150
in standard coordinates, you
multiply by some matrix A and

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.920
you get the transformation
of x.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.390
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.300
This is in standard
coordinates.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.640
And we've also seen that we
could change our coordinates.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.480
We can get coordinates with
respect to some other basis.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.740
We can multiply x times C
inverse and then we'll get the

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.980
representation of x or in
coordinates with respect to

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.750
some other basis, and then we
can multiply that times some

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.800
other matrix D.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.130
And we've seen-- let me write
this down-- that D is equal to

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.120
C inverse times A times C.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.760
We showed this I think it was
two or three videos ago, where

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.395
C is just the change
of basis matrix.

00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:27.330
C is just the matrix
that has our new

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.040
basis vectors as columns.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.080
And C inverse is obviously
its inverse.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.790
So we can apply D.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.300
And then if we multiply D
times this B coordinate

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.750
version of x, we will get the
B coordinate version of the

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.970
transformation of x, so the
transformation of x

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.640
represented in B coordinates.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.440
And then, you know, you could
convert back and forth between

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:52.970
these guys.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.283
You could go this way if you
multiply by C inverse.

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.030
You could go that way
if you multiply C.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.030
We've seen this in
multiple videos.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.140
Now, in this particular case
that we're dealing with, I

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.680
want to find A.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.330
I've kind of defined my
transformation in kind of

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.850
touchy-feely terms. I've just
verbally defined it, but I

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.170
would like to have a
transformation matrix with

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.500
respect to my standard basis.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.190
But I just showed you
that it's not easy.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.960
I'll have to break out some
serious geometry and

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.480
trigonometry to figure out what
happens to 1, 0 when I

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.540
reflect around the line
spanned by 1, 2.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.640
It's not easy.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.180
But what if we change basis?

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.030
What if we change basis
to some new basis?

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.760
Let's say we define some new
basis, where our spanning

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:40.940
vectors or our basis vectors are
this guy, are the vectors

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.150
2, 1, and the vectors 1, 2.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.240
So you can almost view that
our new horizontal axis--

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.990
obviously, it's not horizontal,
but if you want to

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.450
think of it this way-- is going
to be like that, and our

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.360
new vertical axis
is like this.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.880
And now in this world, our
transformation is just a

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.520
reflection around our
new vertical axis.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.720
So maybe it'll be easier to find
D, because this might be

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.570
a simpler transformation in this
other coordinate system.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.020
And then if we can find D,
then we can solve for A.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.810
We've seen this.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:22.310
A is just equal to C times
D times C inverse.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.950
I showed that to you a
couple of videos ago.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.455
So let's see if it's
easier to find D.

00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:34.030
So let's just experiment
a little bit.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.260
Let's label our transformation
vectors.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.770
Let's say this is-- or
our basis vectors.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:39.820
Let's say that's v1.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.990
That's the same label I applied
to it over here.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.030
Let's say that this spanning
vector right here of our line

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.620
that we're reflecting around,
let's call that v2.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.560
So our new coordinate
system has the basis

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.910
vectors v1 and v2.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:10:05.930
Now, what is v1 represented
in our new basis?

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.430
Remember, when you transfer to
a new basis, all it means is

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.560
how much do your coordinates--
your first coordinate now is

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.700
going to be-- how much of your
first basis vector do you need

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.990
to get a linear combination
of v1 and how much

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.860
of your second one?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:30.760
Well, v1-- is just equal to 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.050
I mean, if I wanted to, I
could've found C inverse and

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.280
multiplied by it, but it's
almost trivial to find the

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.430
linear combination of your basis
vectors that gets v1.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.560
In fact, it's not almost
trivial, it is trivial.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.360
v1 is 1 times v1 plus
0 times v2.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.940
So its coordinates with respect
to the basis B are

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.940
going to be 1 times v1
plus 0 times v2.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:54.910
Fair enough.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:11:01.520
Now, what is D going to be?

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.590
Let's see.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.000
Let's say we want to find D
first, because if we can find

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.510
D, then we can just apply this
formula here to figure out A.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:17.030
Now, let's just say D is
equal to-- it's going

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.210
to be a 2-by-2 vector.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.890
It's still mapping
from R2 to R2.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:22.540
This is still a two-dimensional
space.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.700
This is going to map within this
two-dimensional space.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.730
So let's say D has just two
column vectors d1 and

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.740
d2, just like that.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:35.690
So what is D times this
going to give us?

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.040
So let me write it this way.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.380
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.400
I'd like to show that little
chart right there.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:51.830
But D times the B coordinate
version of our first basis

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:57.030
vector is going to be equal to
d1, d2-- those are the two

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:05.420
columns of D-- d1, d2 times v1
in B coordinates, right?

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.800
So it's times 1, 0.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.770
Now, what is this going
to be equal to?

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.870
Well, this is just going
to be a linear

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.155
combination of these columns.

00:12:16.155 --> 00:12:23.180
So it's going to be 1 times d1
plus 0 times d2, which is just

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.720
d1, so it's the first
column of this.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.160
But what is that also
going to equal?

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.750
If I multiply D times the B
coordinate version of x, I've

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.600
just gotten the B coordinate
version of the

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.550
transformation of x.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:46.260
So this is going to be equal to
the B coordinate version of

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:52.730
the transformation of v1.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.540
If you just put a v1 here
instead of an x, v1's B

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.480
version, right there, times D
is going to be equal to the

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.940
transformation of v1's B version
Or its coordinates

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.040
with respect to B.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.430
So it's just that thing
right there.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.510
So there's a couple of
interesting things here.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.540
We just got that the first
column, just by applying D

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.280
times this has got to be equal
to this, we just figured out

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.290
that the first column of D,
because if you take this times

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:30.260
1, 0, which is the first basis
vector's representation in its

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.880
own basis, and you're going to
see in general that when you

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.670
represent these basis vectors
in their own basis, they're

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.660
going to look just like your
standard basis vectors in this

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.030
new coordinate system.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.240
So when you represented 2, 1 in
your new basis with respect

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.850
to this, of course, it's 1 times
this plus 0 times this.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.330
It's going to be 1, 0.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.760
If you want to represent
v2 in your new basis,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.550
well, what is it?

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.410
It's 0 times this guy plus
1 times this guy.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.790
It's 0 times v1 plus
1 times v2.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.690
So it's going to be 0, 1.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.510
And you're going to see this
is generally the case.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.050
And when you think about it,
it's almost ridiculously

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.550
obvious that the first basis
vector is going be 1 times the

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:12.510
first basis vector plus 0 times
the second basis vector.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.050
And if you had n basis vectors,
it would be 1 times

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:18.360
the first basis vector plus 0
times all of the other ones.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:24.990
And in general, if you're
dealing with the nth basis

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.340
vector and you want to express
it in your basis, you're

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.870
essentially going to have a
bunch of the zeroes all the

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.460
way-- because it's 1 times your
nth basis vector, and

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.790
then everything else
is zeroes, so

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.600
this'll be the nth term.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.290
So this applies generally, or
you could called this en, if

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.310
you want to call your standard
basis vectors that way.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:46.440
This is a bit of an aside.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.800
I just want to show you that
this idea is generalizable.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.140
Now, what's useful about this?

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:57.725
Well, just applying this little
logic, D times this guy

00:14:57.725 --> 00:15:01.480
is that guy, we figured out that
the first column of D is

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.580
equal to the transformation
applied to our first basis

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.510
vector in B coordinates.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.230
So if I wanted to rewrite D, I
could rewrite D like this.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.610
The first column is d1, which
is the same thing as the

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:24.250
transformation applied to v1,
our first basis vector, in B

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.340
coordinates.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.770
Now, what is d2?

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.480
Well, let's do the same
thing to v2, to our

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.690
second basis vector.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:40.940
So if I multiply D times the
second basis vector v2 in B

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.150
coordinates, in our new
coordinate system, that is

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:50.425
equal to d1, d2 times-- what is
this guy's representation

00:15:50.425 --> 00:15:51.640
in our new coordinate system?

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.140
It's 0 times v1, plus
1 times v2.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.810
It's 0, 1.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.640
I wrote it up here.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.470
It's 0, 1.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:05.920
So this is going to be equal to
0 times d1 plus 1 times d2,

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.320
which is equal to d2.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.450
And what is that going
to be equal to?

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.260
If you multiply D times some B
coordinate representation of

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.240
x, you're going to get the B
coordinate representation of

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.680
the transformation of x.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.340
So this is going to be equal
to the B coordinate

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.950
representation of the
transformation of v2.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.460
And just like that, we see that
column 2 in D, the second

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.320
column, so this was the first
column, the second column in D

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.580
is just this guy.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:45.985
It's the transformation of
v2 in B coordinates.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.810
Now, is this any easier to find
than this stuff up here?

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.670
Remember, before, we said,
hey, if we just apply the

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.550
transformation to the standard
basis vectors, we can get the

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.400
standard transformation or we
can find the transformation

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.630
matrix with respect to the
standard basis, and that's all

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.370
we wanted to do.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.060
And we said that's not easy.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:07.490
Is this any easier?

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:13.020
Well, what is the transformation
of v1?

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.890
Let's go back to our original
transformation definition.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.630
This is v1 right here.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:25.400
The transformation of v1 ended
up being minus v1.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.710
It equals minus v1.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.870
So if we wanted to write the
transformation of v1 in B

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.130
coordinates-- so let me
write this right here.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:44.890
So the transformation of v1,
if I wanted to reflect it

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.820
around the line L, it just
was equal to minus v1.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.530
That's because v1 was orthogonal
to the line, right?

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.700
That's why we picked it.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.455
If you just take the
transformation of this guy, it

00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:56.610
just flips over and you get
the minus of the vector.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:00.220
So what is this guy, if we want
to apply it, if we wanted

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.266
to write this in
B coordinates?

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:13.940
Well, minus v1 is just equal
to minus 1 times v1

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.380
plus 0 times v2.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.540
So minus v1's coordinates, in
B coordinates, they're just

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:25.260
going to be equal to minus 1
times v1 plus 0 times v2.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.130
Remember, these are just the
weights on your basis vector.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.950
So this thing right here is
pretty straightforward.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:35.810
This is just going to be equal
to minus 1 and 0, the first

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.960
column of D.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.340
Now, what's the second
column of D?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.660
It's the transformation of v2.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.170
v2 was the vector that
spanned our line.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.220
This is v2 right here.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.140
So what happens to v2 when
you transform it?

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.790
Well, you take the reflection
of something that's on the

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.990
line, around that line, it's
just going to be the same.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.980
Nothing's going to change.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.390
You're taking a reflection
around this.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.330
You can kind of imagine spinning
that vector, but it's

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.600
not going to change the
vector at all, right?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.430
So the transformation of this
guy, of 1, 2, is just

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.830
going to be 1, 2.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:11.550
The transformation of v2 is just
going to be equal to v2.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.030
Let me write that down.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:19.060
The transformation of v2 is just
going to be equal to v2.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.910
As you can see, we've picked
these basis vectors because

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.820
transforming them was
very natural.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.320
It was very easy.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.060
So what about this guy, if I
wanted to represent this guy

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.970
in B coordinates?

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.050
Well, v2 in B coordinates, we
already figured out is 0, 1.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.790
So this is just going
to be 0, 1.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:41.500
So now we have our
transformation matrix D with

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.340
respect to basis B.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.440
It is equal to the
transformation of our first

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.640
basis vector with respect to
the B coordinates, which is

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.940
minus 1, 0.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.210
And then its second column is
the transformation of our

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:59.630
second basis vector with respect
to B coordinates, so

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.730
it's 0, 1, or the B coordinate
representation of the

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.300
transformation of our
second basis vector.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.950
The language can get convoluted
sometimes.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.030
And that was neat.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.010
That was easy.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.980
We now have solved for D.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.470
And now that we've solved for
D, you notice that changing

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.520
the basis was actually very
natural, and it was very easy

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.020
to find what D is.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.360
And now that we know what D is,
we can now solve for A.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.060
We can now solve for the
transformation matrix with

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.210
respect to the standard basis.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.560
So to do that, we have to figure
out C and C inverse.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.750
So C, remember, C is just the
change of basis matrix.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.160
And all that is is the
basis vectors.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.290
It's just a matrix with the
basis vectors in the column.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:46.030
So we have our basis
right here.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.050
So C is just 2, 1 and 1, 2.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.210
And then what is C inverse?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:58.200
C inverse is equal to-- well,
we have to find that this

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.470
guy's determinant, so it's
2 times 2, which is 4.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.630
4 minus 1 times 1, so it's 3.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.960
So we do one over the
determinant, 1/3, times-- you

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.170
swap these dudes right here.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.290
So this becomes a 2 and a 2,
and then you make these two

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.530
guys negative.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.390
Negative 1, negative 1.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.360
That's C inverse.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.010
So now we're ready
to solve for A.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:27.410
So A is going to be equal-- let
me pick a nice color here.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:39.310
A is going to be equal to C,
which is 2, 1; 1, 2 times D.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:50.320
D is minus 1, 0; 0, 1 times C
inverse, which is 1/3, 2 minus

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.030
1; minus 1, 2.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.510
So let's solve this.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.410
Let's just do some matrix-matrix
products.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.620
So let's do these two guys
first. And so what do we get?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.850
We're going to get
a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.680
We get 2 times minus 1 plus 1
times 0, so this is just going

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.090
to be minus 2.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:16.790
And then here, you get 2 times
0 plus 1 times 1, so you're

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.250
just going to get 1, right?

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.590
2 times 0 plus 1 times 1.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.920
And then here, 1 times minus
1 plus 2 times 0.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.500
That's just minus 1.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.175
And then you get 1 times
0 plus 2 times 1.

00:22:29.175 --> 00:22:31.030
That's just 2.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.460
And now we're going to have
to multiply this times

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.870
this guy over here.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.970
Let me put the 1/3 out
front, so we can

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.020
worry about that later.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.040
And then let me multiply times
this, so times 2, minus 1;

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.120
minus 1, 2.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.110
And all of this is going
to be equal to A.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.060
I'll do it in yellow.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.350
So this is going to be another
2-by-2 matrix.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:57.830
And so we get negative 2 times
2, which is minus 4.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.080
Let me write out, so I
don't make careless

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.420
mistakes Minus 4.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:06.560
Minus 2 times 2 plus 1 times
minus 1, so minus 1.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.320
That's that term right there.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.470
The next term is minus 2 times
minus 1, which is 2 plus 1

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.420
times 2, so plus 2.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.550
And then let's do this term.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:22.380
Minus 1 times 2 is minus
2 plus 2 times minus 1,

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.000
which is minus 2.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.040
And then finally we have minus
1 times minus 1, which is 1,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.840
plus 2 times 2.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.955
1 plus 4.

00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.440
Let me make sure I
did that right.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.840
Minus 2 times 2 as minus 4,
1 times minus 1-- yeah,

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.000
I think I got it.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.370
And, of course, we have a 1/3
out front, so this is going to

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.460
be equal to 1/3 times
the matrix.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:53.960
Minus 4 minus 1 is minus
5, 4; minus 4, and 5.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:24:04.560
Or it is equal to minus 5/3,
4/3, minus 4/3, and 5/3.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:09.470
That is our transformation
matrix A with respect to the

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.950
standard basis.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.110
Now, let me check something,
because I have a suspicion

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.720
because I did this before, and I
don't have what I did before

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.100
in front of me, but I think
I got a different answer.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.870
So let me just make sure
I did this correctly.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.880
So C, these are our basis
vectors right there.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.340
Let's see, our basis vectors
were the vectors-- oh, well,

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.330
our first basis vector was
the vector 2 minus 1.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.820
So that's where my
error came from.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:37.220
My first basis vector was the
vector 2 minus 1 and my second

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:39.670
basis vector is the
vector 2, 1.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.640
So that obviously is going
to change my C.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.270
It won't change anything else,
because we really didn't use

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.580
this information
anywhere else.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.380
So it's going to be 2, minus
1, so C is 2, minus 1.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.480
So C inverse, let's see, the
determinant is going to be 2

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:03.075
times 2, which is 4 minus
1 times 1, so it's going

00:25:03.075 --> 00:25:04.400
to be 4 plus 1.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.210
So this is going to be a 5.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.235
Sorry for the error.

00:25:07.235 --> 00:25:09.200
And then we're going to
switch these two guys.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.560
And then these two guys are
going to become negative.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.080
So this guy's going to
become negative.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.630
This guy's going to be a plus.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.730
Let me rewrite that.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.590
I apologize for the error.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:27.000
C inverse is going to be 2, 1;
minus 1, 2 times 1/5, not 1/3.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.930
That's what that negative
1 changes.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:29.920
And so what are we
going to get?

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.550
There's going to be 2 minus--
this is C inverse right here,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.410
so it's going to be 2 minus 1.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.810
This is a plus 1 and this
is going to be a 5.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.790
And then so this is going to
be a 5 and this is going

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.600
to be a plus 1.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.850
This thing wouldn't change, or
actually, this will change,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.110
because C is now 2 minus 1.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.490
Actually, let me just redo this
part, because I realize

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.080
that I made it a bit of a mess,
and just to go through

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.570
this and correct this
is a bit hairy.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.820
It's easier just to redo the
whole multiplication.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.920
I apologize about that.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.460
I apologize for wasting your
time with my error.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.500
So A is equal to-- let
me rewrite them.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:11.460
2, 1; minus 1, 2, right?

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:16.480
2, minus 1; 1, 2-- these
are our basis vectors.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:22.190
I forgot that minus sign there--
times our vector D,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:27.300
minus 1, 0; 0, 1-- our matrix
D-- times 1/5-- let me just

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.030
write the 1/5 out here--
times 1/5.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.500
This is C inverse, so
we're going to have

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.220
2, 1; minus 1, 2.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.850
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.610
So first we can do these
two guys right there.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:45.790
So it's going to be 1/5 times--
we have 2 times minus

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:48.770
1 plus 1 times 0,
so it's minus 2.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:52.720
2 times 0 plus 1 times
1 is 1, right?

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.510
You have minus 1 times minus
1 plus 2 times 0,

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:56.940
so that's just 1.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.300
And then minus 1 times 0, which
is 0, plus 2 times 1,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.780
which is just 2.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:06.410
And then we multiply it times
this guy, 2, minus 1; 1, 2.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:07.630
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:13.510
This is going to be equal to 1/5
times minus 2 times 2 is

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:18.260
minus 4 plus 1 times
1: plus 1.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.170
And then your next term is
going to be minus 2 times

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:24.640
minus 1, which is 2, plus 1
times 2, so it's plus 2.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.560
And then we have 1 times 2,
which is 2, plus 2 times 1,

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.860
which is 2, right?

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.600
1 times 2, plus 2 times 1.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.800
And then you have
1 times minus 1.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.970
You have 1 times minus 1, which
is minus 1, plus 2 times

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.180
2, which is 4.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:46.780
So this is going to be equal to
1/5 times-- we have a minus

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:53.550
3, we have a 4, a 4,
and a minus 3.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.140
Sorry, a plus 3.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:59.350
Minus 4, a minus 3,
and then a plus 3.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.920
You can imagine when you deal
with matrices, arithmetic is

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.240
what will trip you up.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.700
So your matrix A, contrary to
what I found out a few minutes

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:21.180
ago, is equal to minus 3/5,
4/5, and then 4/5,

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.650
3/5, just like that.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:28.100
So barring my slight arithmetic
error, which I got

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.230
from writing down the basis
vectors incorrectly,

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.060
forgetting to put that
negative number, now

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.880
hopefully, you realize you can
appreciate that we found an

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.630
easier way to find this
transformation matrix A with

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.780
respect to the standard basis.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:46.290
You find the transformation
matrix D first in a more

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.840
natural basis coordinate system,
and then you can solve

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.010
for A from that.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.150
And you get this result down
there, which is hopefully the

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.690
right answer.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.590
If my memory serves me right,
this is what I got the first

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.410
time I did the problem.
