00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.610
There are other things, other
than carbons, that might

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.760
branch off of the main chain.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.560
And in this video, I want
to introduce you

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.566
to the alkyl halides.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.650
And this is a situation where
one of the halogen elements,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.530
and the halogen elements are
the second to last, or the

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.260
second to the right, or to the
right most column in the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.050
periodic table.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
Fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, iodine.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.400
It's when one of these replace
one of the hydrogens attached

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.020
to a carbon.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.600
So I've drawn some alkyl
halides here.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.340
And let's think a little bit
of how to name them.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.670
So like we name all of our
organic molecules so far, you

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.130
look for the longest chain
first. And the longest chain

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.490
that contains a double
bond if there is one.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.840
In this case, there is no double
bond, so the longest

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.280
chain looks like this.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.500
We start here and we
go over there.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.780
Or we could go either way, but
this is the longest chain.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.860
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.790
seven, eight carbons.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.430
Let me make sure of that.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.190
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight carbons.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.170
And we want to start at the end
where we're going to run

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.770
into either some type of halide
first or some other

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.920
type of branch off of it.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.070
Just something attached
to the carbon change

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.000
other than a hydrogen.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.490
So we're going to start
at this end.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:35.500
So it's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.800
So we're dealing
with an octane.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.870
Our main chain has eight
carbons, so we're

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.880
dealing with an octane.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.300
And now we have to think about
these different halogens that

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.970
we have here.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.660
So first we have a chlorine
at carbon number two.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.490
So that's going to be 2-chloro,
is what we're going

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.000
to call that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.810
And we're going to put them in
alphabetical order and then

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.410
put them in front
of the octane.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.470
And then this right here is
a-- it's on the fourth

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.834
carbon-- so it is a 4-bromo.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.340
The actual element is
called bromine.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.720
We change the ine to an
oro, so this is bromo.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.180
The ine to an o, I should say.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.590
So this is bromo.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.140
And B comes before C, but we're
not done yet, because we

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.860
don't have just halides here.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.060
We don't just have these
halogens over here.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.320
We also have a methyl group.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.380
We have one carbon sitting
over here.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.080
So we don't want to
forget that guy.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.460
So that right there,
that is a 5-methyl.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.980
So when we write it all
out, we do it in

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.280
alphabetical order.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.730
B takes precedence.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.215
So this will be 4-bromo-- I'll
do it over here-- 4-bromo.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.960
Then the next thing
we have is C.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.210
So 4-bromo-2-chloro
-5-methyloctane.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.790
Now if we take look at this
structure over here, our main

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.710
carbon branch, we only have two
carbons in it right here.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.160
So we're dealing with
eth or ethane.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.440
It's a single bond.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.390
So this tells us that we're
dealing with an ethane.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.880
And let's see what we
have attached to it.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.740
We have a bunch of these
halogens attached to it.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.060
We replaced a bunch of our
hydrogens with halogens.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.160
So we have these
fluorines here.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:56.980
And so we can start at
the end that has more

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.150
things attached to it.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.000
So in this case, we have one,
two, three fluorines attached.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.630
So this is going to start off
with-- and then fluorines,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.250
well I'll just leave it
like that for now.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.800
I was going to write it, but
then I have to remember,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.900
you're going to have
to alphabetize it.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300
So let me just write out.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.560
So at some point in our name,
we're going to have attached--

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.749
we're going to start
here-- that's going

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.570
to be the one carbon.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.880
That is the one carbon.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.750
That is the two carbon.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.890
So at one point in our chain--
let me switch colors

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.600
actually-- we're going to have
one, two, three flourines.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.420
So it's going to
be a trifluoro.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.730
And they're all at
the one carbon.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.980
So it's going to be
a 1,1,1-trifluoro.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.510
That'll take care of those
three fluorines there.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.600
And then we're going to have,
at some point in our name,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.730
this bromo is attached to the
two carbon, so 2-bromo.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.810
And then you also
have this chloro

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.100
attached to the two carbon.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.350
So you're also going
to have 2,2-chloro.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.590
So then you go in alphabetical
order.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.910
B takes precedence.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.100
And then you're going to go to
C, and then the trifluoro.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.030
You ignore the tri.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.700
But F still comes
after B and C.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:24.258
So this is going to be 2-bromo
2-chloro-- I want to do that

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:32.770
same shade of green--
2-chloro, same idea.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.310
And then we have
1,1,1-trifluoroethane.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.220
Now I want to make one thing
clear, when you do this.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.510
Double bonds, we saw on the
last video-- we learned a

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.300
little bit about alkenes-- still
take precedence over

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.880
everything.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.060
So if we go to this original
compound-- this original

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.950
molecule up here-- if I were to
throw a double bond here.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.820
So let's say I threw
a double bond.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.230
Then all of a sudden that'll
change the naming mechanism.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.350
First of all, we're not doing
with an octane anymore.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.670
We're dealing with an octene.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.430
So in this situation, the
chain-- we'll start at the end

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.980
closest to the double bond--
there's one, two, three, four,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.170
five, six, seven, eight.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.010
So now this becomes 7-chloro.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.930
This will be 5-bromo.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.940
This is 4-methyl.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.520
And this compound over here,
it will no longer be this

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.250
thing over here, because I've
added this double bond.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.410
It will now be going in
alphabetical order.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:48.660
It would be 5-bromo.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.420
Let me have some space here.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.670
It will be
5-bromo-7-chloro-4-methyl.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.520
And then we have oct.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.470
But it's an alkene,
so it's oct.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.510
We have to specify where
we start our

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.080
double bond, oct-2-ene.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.910
Now if we had two
double bonds.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.480
Let's say we had a situation
where it was, maybe we had,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.020
let's see we don't want to
put too many bonds here.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.350
Carbon will only have
four bonds.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.790
This carbon has three.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.840
This hydrogen, we could have
double bond over here.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.840
In that situation, we're going
to have-- and I actually

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.060
didn't specify it correctly in
the last video, so this is a

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.960
bit of a correction-- instead of
being 2-ene, this will now

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.250
be-- well let me make it instead
of being 2-ene when I

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:02.890
add that second carbon there, or
that second double bond, it

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.890
will now be-- scroll over to
the right a little bit-- it

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.540
will now be oct dash.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.210
We have a double bond
at the two.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.800
Starting at the two
and at the four.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.760
2 comma 4.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.280
And it's no longer
just an ene.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.570
That was a mistake I did
in the last video.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.870
I said hept, and I
just put an ene.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.780
Now that I have two double
bonds, it's a diene.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.240
So you don't want
to forget that.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.690
That tells us that we have
two double bonds here.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.860
Although it's kind of
obvious, because I'm

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.130
listing a 2 and a 4.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.590
So it's a little
bit redundant.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.690
2 and 4 diene.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.289
So if you have it with these
two double bonds, we have

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:39.539
5-bromo-7-chloro
-4-methyl-oct-2,4-diene.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.290
And the whole reason why I
introduced this is really to

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.280
make a bit of a correction.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.430
Well to show you two things.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.250
One, that the double bond takes
precedence when you are

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.170
deciding which direction
to number in.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.150
And then also to correct a
little bit of a mistake in the

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.330
last video where I forgot to
put the di when I had two

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.580
double bonds.
