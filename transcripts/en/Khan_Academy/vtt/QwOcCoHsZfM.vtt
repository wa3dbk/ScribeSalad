00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.350
We're on problem 43.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.440
Which statement describes
the graph of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.330
the following equation?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:17.710
They write x squared plus y
squared plus 4x minus 6y minus

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.250
3 is equal to 0.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.330
Essentially you want to get
this into standard conic

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.800
square format-- I don't know
what it's officially called--

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.560
and you do that by completing
the square on both the x and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.330
the y I guess you could call
it sub-polynomial.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.240
Then you should be able
recognize what kind of conic

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.190
section it is.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.660
So let's separate out the x
and the y terms. So the x

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.485
terms-- I'll do that in blue--
you get x squared plus 4x.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.910
Then we're going to add
something that makes it a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.000
perfect square.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.600
You can already guess what
we're going to add.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.660
Let's say we're going to add 4,
because x squared plus 4x

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.310
plus 4 is x plus 2 squared.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.320
So I'm going to write that in
magenta just so we remember

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.620
that we added it.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.450
This came out of nowhere
right now.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.350
So if I added plus 4 here,
I'm going to have to add

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.550
plus 4 on this side.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.480
This is the equals sign.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.760
All right, then let me do the
y terms. I'll do it in this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.860
brown color.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.490
Plus y squared minus 6y.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.340
Then what would add here?

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.680
Half of minus 6 is mine 3.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.380
Then if I were to square that,
minus 3 squared-- I'll do it

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.050
in this magenta color
again-- is plus 9.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.900
So I want to add plus 9 to the
right-hand side as well.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.920
Of course this is y minus 3
squared, this whole thing

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.150
right here.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.080
Then I have that minus
3 right over here.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.650
All right now let's rewrite
this term right here.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.310
I added this plus 4 here for a
reason so that I could make

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.690
this into x plus 2 squared, then
plus-- and I added this

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.640
plus 9 here for a reason,
so I could make

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.755
this y minus 3 squared.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.600
Let me just keep the minus
3 there for now.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.280
Minus-- let me do it in the
other color-- minus 3 is equal

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.910
to 4 plus 9.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.530
4 plus 9 is equal to 13.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.570
Let's add the 3 to both sides
of that equation.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:29.360
So you get x plus 2 squared
plus y minus 3 squared is

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.960
equal to 16.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.720
Now if you think about it, this
is the form of a circle.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.390
x minus a squared plus y minus
b squared is equal to r

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.550
squared, where the center of
the circle is at where?

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.360
Whatever the x-value is what
makes this equal to 0.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.640
So it's x, it's minus 2.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.810
Then the y-value of its center
is what makes this equal to 0.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.830
Minus 2 comma 3, that's
its center.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.580
It's radius is the square
root of 16.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.310
So the radius is equal to 4.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.480
It can't be negative 4.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.720
You can't have a negative
radius.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.530
So the answer is a circle with
radius at minus 2 comma

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.590
3 and radius 4.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.770
That's choice D.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.720
Problem 44.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.390
What is the solution to
the equation 5 to the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.230
x is equal to 17?

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.560
OK so that means that we if we
take the log base, so five to

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.010
the x power is equal to 17.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.040
We could rewrite this
in log format.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.960
That means that log base 5 of
seventeen is equal to x.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.630
You could read this exactly the
same way you read that.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.680
5 to the x is equal to 17.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.810
Of course that's not one of
our choices, and this is

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.510
fairly useless on your
calculator because you don't

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.440
have a log base 5 button.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.560
Let me write it this way, x is
equal to-- I'm just switching

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.260
it-- log base 5 of 17, just
because it's easier

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.600
for me to deal with.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.025
I prove it in previous Khan
Academy logarithm videos, but

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:24.850
there's just a general
property.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.060
I'll write the property here.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:35.320
If x is equal to log base, I
don't know, base b of a, that

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:44.260
is equal to log base 10 of a,
lowercase a, divided by log

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.030
base 10 of b.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.760
You just have to pick
the same base.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.800
You could have the base, you
could have the natural log of

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.370
a divided by the natural
log of b.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.510
You could do whatever log you
want, but log base 10 is on

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.030
your calculator.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.840
So that's why this
is convenient.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.090
So we could say this is equal
to the log base 10 of 17

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.290
divided by the log
base 10 of 5.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.420
That should be a choice.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.850
Yep, that's choice D.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.690
Next question.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.472
This problem 45.

00:05:23.472 --> 00:05:27.370
I'll write it down, 45.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.450
They say if log base 10 of x is
equal to minus 2, what is

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.840
the value of x?

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.910
So that essentially --
10 to the minus 2

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.160
power is equal to x.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.090
All a logarithm is, it tells you
what exponent do I have to

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.170
raise the base to to get
whatever I'm inputting into

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.250
the logarithm function.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.000
Right So if I raise 10 to
the minus 2, I get x.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.740
10 to the minus 2, that's 1 over
10 squared is equal to x,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.380
which is 1 over 100
is equal to x.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.630
That's choice C.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.530
I think I could do problem
46 right here.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.610
46.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:23.820
Which equation is equivalent
to log base 3 of

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:31.140
1/9 is equal to x?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.750
OK, read it the exact same
way we read question 45.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.515
This is just saying that 3 to
the x power is equal to 1/9.

00:06:39.515 --> 00:06:40.910
Let's write that.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.910
3 to the x power is
equal to 1/9.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.370
Is that one of the choices?

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.810
Yeah.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.060
That's choice C.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.070
That was suspiciously
easy, I think.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.426
You just have to know
the definition of

00:06:54.426 --> 00:06:56.080
what a logarithm is.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.360
OK problem 47.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.130
I'll clear the screen.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.380
Let me switch colors.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.350
47.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.000
Oh I'll cut and paste this one
because this is interesting.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.960
Let me pull it up a little bit
so you can definitely read it.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.240
Because they want us to identify
an incorrect step.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.520
OK let me go here.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.110
OK they ask us, which is the
first incorrect step in

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.220
simplifying log base
4 of 4 over 64.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.010
All right step 1, they said log
base 4 4/64 is equal to

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.330
log base 4 4 minus
log base 4 64.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.690
That's right.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.690
When you divide within the
logarithm function or when

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.290
you're inputting into the
logarithm function, that's

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.230
equivalent of taking the log of
the top one and subtracting

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.920
from that the log
of the bottom.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.300
Actually when you divide two
numbers of the same base, you

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.920
subtract their exponents.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.220
We've proved that in
previous videos.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.410
But that's just good enough
that you need to know that

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.000
that's the correct
step right now.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.460
So what's the log base 4 of 4?

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.030
4 to what power is equal to 4?

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.190
Yeah sure, that's equal to 1.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.660
4 to what power is
equal to 64?

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.180
Let's see, 4 squared is 16.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.060
4 to the 1 is equal to 4.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.910
4 squared is equal to 16.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.110
4 to the third is 4 times
16, which is 64.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.350
So 4 to the third power is 64.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.450
So this is 3.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:40.620
So this should be-- let's see,
log of 4 minus 16-- right,

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.970
this should be a 3 here.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.990
This should be a minus 3.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.430
So this step 2 was the
first incorrect step.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.070
They mis-evaluated
log base 4 of 64.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.820
They through it was 16
for some reason.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.840
I guess they divided 64 by 4.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.615
But it's actually 4 to the third
power of 16, sorry, 4 to

00:08:57.615 --> 00:08:58.950
the third power of 64.

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.175
So the answer there is 3.

00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:02.960
So step 2 is the first
incorrect step.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.420
Next question.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.840
All right let me see.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.365
All right, clear image,
invert colors.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.300
Let me copy and paste this
one too because this is

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.040
interesting.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.570
I'll try to copy and paste
as many of the

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.820
word problems as possible.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.430
This is problem 48.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.390
Let me write that down
in the corner.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:42.770
48, right in that corner.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.920
Jeremy, Michael, Shanan, and
Brenda each worked the same

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.180
math problem of the
chalkboard.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.970
Each student's work
is shown below.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.460
Their teacher said that while
two of them had the correct

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.210
answer, only one of them had
arrived at the correct

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.560
conclusion using
correct steps.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.640
OK they want to which is the
completely correct solution.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.100
OK let me just copy
and paste those.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:09.500
So the completely correct
solution, OK so let's just

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.410
think about what everyone
did here.

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.690
It looks like this is it
dealing with exponents.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.840
All right he had x to third
times x to the minus 7.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.050
OK this is already wrong.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.610
Because x to the minus 7
is 1 over x to the 7.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.880
This is one over x to the 7.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.760
So this should be a
plus right here.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.920
So he's wrong.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.960
OK Shanan, x to the third
times x to the minus 7.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.830
Yep that equals x to the third
over x to the positive 7.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.000
Then let's see, 1
over x to the 4.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.940
That is right, right?

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.380
Because this is equal to
x to the 3 minus 7.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.420
So that's x to the minus 4.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.800
x to the minus 4 is
1 over x to the 4.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.470
So as far as I can tell,
Shanan's work

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.730
looks pretty good.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.020
Although this was a little weird
how she went straight to

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.740
1 over x to the 4.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.310
She may just skipped a step.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.090
Michael's work, x to the
over x to the minus 7.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.165
OK, he made the same
mistake as Jeremy.

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.710
X to the minus 7 when you put it
in the denominator becomes

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.460
x to the positive 7.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.790
Not right.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.560
Then Brenda's work got
this step right.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.150
But then this should be
x to the minus 4, x

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.960
to the minus 4 power.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.140
So this is not correct.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.320
So the only person who got
it right was Shanan.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.920
What choices is that?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.970
Shanan is choice C.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.045
Out of time.

00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:35.240
See you in the next video.
