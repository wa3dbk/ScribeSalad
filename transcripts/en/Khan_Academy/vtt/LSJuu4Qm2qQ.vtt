00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.560
The standard question you often
get in your algebra class is

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.300
they will give you this
equation and it'll say identify

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.050
the conic section and
graph it if you can.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.140
And the equation they give you
won't be in the standard form,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.845
because if it was you could
just kind of pattern match with

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:15.470
what I showed in some of the
previous videos and you'd

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.080
be able to get it.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.600
So let's do a question
like and let's see if

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.230
we can figure it out.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.990
So what I have here is 9x
squared plus 4y squared

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:41.400
plus 54x minus 8y plus
49 is equal to 0.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.050
And once again, I mean who
knows what this is it's just

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.000
not in the standard form.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500
And actually one quick clue to
tell you what this is you look

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.980
at the x squared and the y
squared terms if there are.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.130
If there's only an x squared
term and then there's just a y

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.990
and not a y squared term, then
you're probably dealing with a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.970
parabola, and we'll go
into that more later.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.770
Or if it's the other way
around, if it's just an x

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.330
term and a y squared term,
it's probably a parabola.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.555
But assuming that we're dealing
with a circle, an ellipse, or a

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:09.450
hyperbola, there will be an x
squared term and a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.970
y squared term.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
If they both kind of have the
same number in front of them,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.580
that's a pretty good clue
that we're going to be

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.710
dealing with a circle.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550
If they both have different
numbers, but they're both

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.550
positive in front of them,
that's a pretty good clue

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.500
we're probably going to be
dealing with an ellipse.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.906
If one of them has a negative
number in front of them and

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:30.420
the other one has a positive
number, that tells you that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690
we're probably going to be
dealing with a hyperbola.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.290
But with that said, I mean that
might help you identify things

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.440
very quickly at this level, but
it doesn't help you graph it or

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.500
get into the standard form.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.370
So let's get it in
the standard form.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.720
And the key to getting it in
the standard form is really

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.790
just completing the square.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.710
And I encourage you to re-watch
the completing the square

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.245
video, because that's all we're
going to do right here to get

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:49.740
it into the standard form.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.490
So the first thing I like to do
to complete the square, and

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.590
you're going to have to do it
for the x variables and for

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.190
the y terms, is group
the x and y terms.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.590
Let's see.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.796
The x terms are 9x
squared plus 54x.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.740
And let's do the y
terms in magenta.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:22.130
So then you have plus 4y
squared minus 8y and then you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.500
have-- let me do this in a
different color-- plus

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.290
49 is equal to 0.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.060
And so the easy thing to do
when you complete the square,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.320
the thing I like to do is, it's
very clear we can factor out a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.390
9 out of both of these numbers,
and we can factor out a

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.460
4 out of both of those.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.790
Let's do that, because
that will help us

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.260
complete the square.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.630
So this is the same thing
is 9 times x squared plus

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.790
9 times 6 is 54, 6x.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490
I'm going to add something
else here, but I'll

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.480
leave it blank for now.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:04.250
Plus 4 times y squared minus
2y I'm probably going to add

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.520
something here too, so I'll
leave it blank for now.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.870
Plus 49 is equal to 0.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.880
So what are we
going to add here?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.980
We're going to
complete the square.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.340
We want to add some number here
so that this whole three term

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.780
expression becomes
a perfect square.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.990
Likewise, we're going to add
some number here, so this

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.750
three term number expression
becomes a perfect square.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.240
And of course whatever we add
on the side, we're going

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.670
to have to multiply it by
9, because we're really

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.170
adding nine times that.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.740
And add it on to that side.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.135
Whatever we add here, we're
going to have to multiply

00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:39.160
it times 4 and add
it on that side.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.180
If I put a 1 here, it's really
like as if I had a 4 here,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.720
because 1 times 4 is 4 and if I
had a 1 here it's 1 times 9.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.930
So 9 there.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.220
Let's do that.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.990
When we complete the square,
we just take half of

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.130
this coefficient.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.100
This coefficient is 6, we
take half of it is 3, we

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.290
square it, we get a 9.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.850
Remember it's an equation, so
what you do to one side, you

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.140
have to do to the other.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.320
So if we added a 9 here, we're
actually adding 9 times 9 to

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.030
the left-hand side of the
equation, so we have to add 81

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.070
to the right-hand side to make
the equation still hold.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.550
And you could kind of view
it if we go back up here.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.490
This is the same thing, just
to make that clear as if I

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.200
added plus 81 right here.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.640
Of course I would have had
to add plus 81 up here.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.210
Now let's go to the y terms.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.980
You take half of this
coefficient is minus 2,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.750
half of that is minus 1.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.660
You square it, you get plus 1.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.350
1 times 4, so we're really
adding 4 to the left-hand

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.170
side of the equation.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.210
And just so you understand
what I did here.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.030
This is equivalent as if I just
added a 4 here, and then I

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.520
later just factored out this 4.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.930
And so what does this become?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.630
This expression
is 9 times what?

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.820
This is the square of-- you
could factor this, but we did

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.940
it on purpose-- it's x plus 3
squared and then we have plus

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.910
4 times-- What is
this right here?

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.430
That's y minus 1 squared.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.560
You might want to review
factoring of polynomial or

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.280
completing the square if
you found that step

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.290
a little daunting.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.330
And then we have plus 49 is
equal to 0 plus 81 plus

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.550
84 is equal to 85.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:38.080
All right, so now we have 9
times plus 3 squared plus 4

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.180
times y minus 1 squared.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.360
And let's subtract
49 from both sides.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.380
That is equal to-- let's see if
I subtract 50 from 85 I get 35,

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.360
so if I subtract 49, I get 36.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.300
And now we are getting close to
the standard form of something,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.130
but remember all the standard
forms we did except for the

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.000
circle-- we had a y-- and we
know this isn't a circle,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.780
because we have these weird
coefficients, well not weird

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.520
but different coefficients
in front of these terms.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.040
So to get the 1 on the
right-hand side let's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.140
divide everything by 36.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:20.770
If you divide everything by 36,
this term becomes x plus 3

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:28.030
squared over see 9 over 36 is
the same thing as 1 over 4, and

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.780
then you have plus y minus 1
squared 4 over 36 is the same

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.140
thing as 1 over 9 and all
of that is equal to 1.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.740
And there you go.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.580
We have it in the standard
form, and you can see our

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.990
intuition at the beginning
the problem was correct.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.010
This is indeed an ellipse, and
now we can actually graph it.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.860
So first of all, actually
good place to start, where's

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.030
the center of the this
ellipse going to be?

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.640
It's going to be x is
equal to negative 3.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.820
What x value makes
this whole terms 0?

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.980
So it's going to be x is
equal to minus 3, and y is

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.940
going to be equal to 1.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.910
What y value makes this
term 0? y is equal to 1.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.310
That's our center.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.510
So let's graph that, and then
we can draw the ellipse.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.475
It's going to be in the
negative quadrant.

00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:22.680
This is our x-axis and
this is our y-axis.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.660
And then the center of our
ellipse is at minus 3

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.010
and positive 1, so
that's the center.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.350
And then, what is the
radius in the x direction?

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.640
We just take the square
root of this, so it's 2.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.200
So in the x direction we
go two to the right.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.800
We go two to the left.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.340
And in the y direction,
what do we do?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.120
Well we go up three
and down three.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.890
The square root of this.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:53.610
Let me do that.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.430
Remember you have to take the
square root of both of those.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.080
The vertical axis is actually
the major radius or the

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.430
semi-major axis is 3, because
that's the longer one.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.960
And then the 2 is the minor
radius, because that's

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.100
the shorter one.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.780
And now we're ready to
draw this ellipse.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.310
I'll draw it in brown.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.410
Let me see if I can
do this properly.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.820
I have a shaky hand.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.940
All right, it looks
something like that.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.950
And there you go.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.730
We took this kind of crazy
looking thing, and all we did

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.470
is algebraically manipulate it.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.980
We just completed the squares
with the x's and the y terms.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.180
And then we divided both sides
by this number right here and

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.465
we got it into the
standard form.

00:08:50.465 --> 00:08:51.970
We said oh this is an ellipse.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.800
We have both of these terms,
they're both positive, we're

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.090
adding we're not subtracting,
they have different

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.930
coefficients underneath here.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.510
So we're ready to go over the
ellipse, and we realized that

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.160
the center was at minus 3,1,
and then we just drew the

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.990
major radius, or the major
axis and the minor axis.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.490
See you in the next video.
