00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.208
Is two comma five a solution of this system?

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:06.533
And we have a system of inequalities right over here.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:12.600
We have Y is greater than or equal to 2x plus 1 and X is greater than 1.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.148
In order for two comma five to be a solution of this system, it just has to satisfy both inequalities.

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:20.738
So, lets just try it out.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:25.267
So when X is equal to two and Y is equal to five, it has to satify both of these.

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.067
So lets try it with the first one.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:29.467
So if we assume X is two and Y is five,

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:37.400
we would get an inequality that says that five is greater than or equal to two times two plus one.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.467
X is two; Y is five.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:44.933
This gives us five is greater than or equal to two times two is four plus one is five.

00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:50.133
Y is greater than or equal to five. That's true! Five is equal to five.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.800
So that equal part of the greater than or equal saves us.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.400
That definitely satisfies the first inequality. Lets see the second one.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.600
X needs to be greater than one.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.067
So in two comma five, X is two.

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:06.200
So two is greater than one.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.533
So it actually satisfies both of these inequalities.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:14.333
So two comma five is a solution for this system.
