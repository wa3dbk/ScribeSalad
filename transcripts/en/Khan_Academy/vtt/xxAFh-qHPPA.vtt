00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.590
Multiply, expressing the
product in scientific notation.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.670
So let's multiply
first, and then let's

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.094
try to get what we have
in scientific notation.

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:10.510
Actually, before
we do that, let's

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.480
just even remember what it means
to be in scientific notation.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480
To be in scientific
notation-- and actually,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
each of these numbers right
here are in scientific notation.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.950
It's going to be
the form a times 10

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.820
to some power, where a can be
greater than or equal to 1,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.670
and it is going to
be less than 10.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.227
So both of these numbers are
greater than or equal to 1,

00:00:33.227 --> 00:00:34.810
and they are less
than 10, and they're

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.220
being multiplied by
some power of 10.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.940
Let's see how we
could multiply this.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.060
So this over here, this is
just the exact same thing.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.420
So if I do this in magenta,
this is the exact same thing

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:54.410
as 9.1 times 10 to the sixth
times 3.2 times-- actually,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.620
I don't have to write it.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.600
Let me write it all
with a dot notation

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.475
to make it a little bit
more straightforward.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.555
I'm doing that in magenta.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:12.150
This is equal to 9.1
times 10 to the sixth--

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.760
let me do it in this green
color-- times 3.2 times 10

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.970
to the negative 5th power.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.260
Now in multiplication,
this comes

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.740
from the associative property.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.540
It essentially allows us to
remove these parentheses.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.560
It says, look, you can
multiply like that first,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.630
or you could actually
multiply these guys first.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.040
You can reassociate them.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.605
And the commutative
property tells us

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:36.004
that we can rearrange
this thing right here.

00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:37.420
What I want to
rearrange is I want

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.860
to multiply the 9.1 times
the 3.2 first and then

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.382
multiply that times 10 to the
sixth times 10 the negative 5.

00:01:43.382 --> 00:01:44.840
So I'm just going
to rearrange this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.740
using the commutative property.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.410
This is the same thing
as 9.1 times 3.2,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.060
and I'm going to reassociate.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.920
So I'm going to do these
first, and then that times 10

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.920
to the sixth times
10 to the negative 5.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.990
And the reason
why this is useful

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.070
is that this is really
easy to multiply.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.610
We have the same
base here, base 10,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.370
and we're taking the product,
so we can add the exponents.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.239
So this part right over here,
10 to the sixth times 10

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.780
to the negative 5,
that's going to be

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.180
10 to the 6 minus 5 power,
or essentially just 10

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.370
to the first power, which
is really just equal to 10.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.590
And that's going to be
multiplied by 9.1 times 3.2.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.760
So let me do that over here.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.767
If I have 9.1 times
3.2, so at first

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.600
I'm going to ignore the
decimal, so I'm just

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.690
going to treat it
like 91 times 32.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.695
So I have 2 times 1 is 2.

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:50.020
2 times 9 is 18.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.330
I'll stick a 0 here because
I'm in the tens place

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.210
now, multiplying everything
really by 30 not just by 3.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.100
That's why my zero is there.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.840
And I multiplied 3
times 1 to get 3,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.230
and then 3 times 9 is 27.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.220
And so it is 2.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.290
So I'm adding here.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.860
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.980
8 plus 3 is 11, carry
or regroup that 1.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.360
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.990
2 plus 7 is 9.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.760
And then I have a 2 here.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.800
So 91 times 32 is 2,912.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.740
But I didn't
multiply 91 times 32.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.110
I multiplied 9.1 times 3.2.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.850
So what I want to do
is count the number

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.050
of digits I have behind
the decimal point.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.571
I have one, two digits
behind the decimal point,

00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:38.070
and so I'll have to have two
digits behind the decimal point

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.690
in the answer.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.330
So one, two, I'll stick the
decimal right over there.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.550
This part right over here
comes out to be 29.12.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.890
You might feel like we're done.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.150
This kind of looks like
scientific notation.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.970
I have a number
times a power of 10.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.010
But remember, this number has to
be greater than or equal to 1--

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.410
which it is-- and less than 10.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.240
But this number is
not less than 10.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.534
It's not in scientific notation.

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:08.950
What we can do is
let's just write

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.100
this number in
scientific notation,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.830
and then we can use
the power of 10 part

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.490
to multiply by this power of 10.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.890
29.12, this is the
same thing as 2.912.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.270
Notice, what did I do to
go from there to there?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.410
I just moved the
decimal to the left.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.980
Or another way to
think about it,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.060
if I wanted to go from here to
there, what could I do to this?

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.660
Well, I would multiply it by 10.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.800
If I multiplied it by 10,
I would move the decimal

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.380
to the right.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.590
It would go from 2.9 to 29.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.120
So if I want to
write this value,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.900
this is just this times 10.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.360
So 29.12 is the same
thing as 2.912 times 10.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.250
Now, this is in
scientific notation,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.750
but that's just this part.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.600
And I still have to
multiply it by another 10,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.510
so times another 10.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.322
To finish up this problem, we
get 2.912 times 10 times 10,

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:11.030
or 10 to the first
times 10 to the first.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.130
Well, what's that?

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.040
Well, that's going to be
this part right over here.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.740
That's just 10 squared.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.170
So it's 2.912 times 10 to the
second power, and we are done.
