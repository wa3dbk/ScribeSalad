00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's start with our classic
system that I keep using over

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.340
and over again.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.270
And that's because it tends
to be very useful for

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.645
instruction.

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:11.400
It also tends to be the system
that is most covered in

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.070
classrooms. So hopefully it'll
be productive for you and your

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.890
school work.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.190
So I have this container.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.020
It has a movable piston
on top, or kind

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.730
of a movable ceiling.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.630
Well, of course, inside of my
system I have a bunch of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.370
molecules or atoms bouncing
around, creating some type of

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.850
pressure on the system.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.550
So let's say it has
some pressure, P1.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.255
This volume right here,
let's call that V1.

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.265
And let's say it also has
some temperature that

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.180
it starts off with.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.120
Everything is in equilibrium.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.600
Remember these are
macro states.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.660
The only way I can even tell
you what the volume, or the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.830
pressure, or the temperature
is, is if the system is in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.160
equilibrium, if everything
in it is uniform.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.230
The temperature is consistent
throughout.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.880
Fair enough.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.930
And in order to keep it placed
down, I have to put

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.880
some rocks on top.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.430
And I've done this in multiple
processes so far.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.510
And, of course, I'm doing these
little pebbles, because

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.090
I'm going to remove
them slowly.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.710
Because I want to approximate
a quasi-static process.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.790
Or I want to approximate a
system that's always close

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.680
enough to equilibrium that I'm
cool with defining our macro

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.005
states, our pressure, our
temperature, or our volume.

00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:22.550
Let me write V for volume.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.640
Now, in this video, I'm going
to study what's called an

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.180
isothermic process.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.600
And really what it just means
is, I'm going to keep the

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.110
temperature the same.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.680
Iso- just means the same.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.340
You probably remember when we
studied the periodic table.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.190
Isotopes, those are the same
element just with different

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.960
mass numbers.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.740
So this is the same temperature
we're going to run

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.900
our process.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.670
So my question is, how
can we do that?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.140
Because as I remove pebbles,
what's going to happen?

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.010
If I just did this, without
any-- if it was completely

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.620
isolated from the world.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.040
And actually I'll add in
a word right here.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.320
If it was an adiabatic
process-- If it was

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.060
adiabatic-- fancy word.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.100
All that means is, completely
isolated from the world.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.010
So no heat is going into
or out of this system.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.540
If this was the case, what would
happen as I released or

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.380
I took away some of these
little particles?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.110
Let me copy and paste it.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500
Well, let me just redraw
it actually.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.660
So I have my one wall.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.910
I have another wall.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.710
I have another wall.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.600
As I release a couple of
pebbles, one at a time, my

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.965
volume is going to increase.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.430
So I'm going to have a slightly
higher volume.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.370
My volume's going to go up.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.300
I have fewer pebbles here now.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.330
And since I have the same number
of molecules, they're

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.000
going to bump into this less.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.430
So pressure is going
to go down.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.070
Volume is going to go up.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.920
And if I was adiabatic, if I had
no extra heat being added

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.370
to the system, what do I know
is going to happen to the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.520
temperature?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.920
Well, think about it this way.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.200
Some work was done, right?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.290
Our old ceiling was maybe
some place around here.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.670
We pushed it up with some
force for some distance.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.070
So we did work.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.930
And so we changed some kinetic
energy, or we transferred some

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.450
kinetic energy, out
of the system.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.870
That's essentially what
the work did.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.640
That kinetic energy was
turned into work.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.900
And temperature is just a
macro measure of average

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.150
kinetic energy.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.170
In fact, we just-- well,
I won't go into it.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.780
But in the last video, the kind
of proof you want-- if

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.340
you didn't watch it because you
didn't want to go through

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.360
the math, which is completely
fair enough because it

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.730
normally wouldn't be done in an
intro chemistry class-- I

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.690
showed that the internal energy
is equal to the total

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.970
kinetic energy, which was equal
to 3/2 times the number

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.270
of moles, times R, times
temperature.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.899
So temperature is just, by some
scaling factor, a measure

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:17.660
of kinetic energy.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.790
Now, when I do some work, it's
essentially a transfer of

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.380
kinetic energy.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.920
And I can't replace that energy
with some heat because

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.900
it's adiabatic.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.500
There's no heat going into
or out of the system.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.500
So in that situation, the
kinetic energy of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.790
the system went down.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.690
The average kinetic energy
of the system went down.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.390
So the temperature would've
also gone down.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.790
And actually, just as a bonus
point, what happened to the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.990
internal energy?

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.210
Well, the internal energy is
the total kinetic energy of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.000
the system.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.540
And I could even right down
the original formula.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.140
Change in internal energy is
equal to change-- let me not

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.350
do that, because I said I
shouldn't-- is equal to heat

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.190
added to the system, minus
work done by the system.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.720
This is work done
by the system.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.250
That's why we're
subtracting it.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.830
Now, it's adiabatic,
so there's no heat

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.120
added to the system.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.830
So the change in internal energy
is equal to the minus

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.580
the work done by the system.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.630
Well, in this situation,
the system did do work.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.300
It pushed this piston up by some
distance with some force.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.880
So, your delta U is negative.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.680
It's less than 0.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.690
So U went down, and
that makes sense.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.090
If temperature changed,
then the internal

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.060
energy is going to change.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.520
And for our simple system,
where internal energy is

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.090
represented by the kinetic
energy of these molecules,

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.330
that's always going
to be the case.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.690
If temperature doesn't change,
internal energy won't change.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.680
If temperature goes up, internal
energy goes up.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.320
If temperature goes down,
internal energy goes down.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.360
And, of course, they're not
the same thing, though.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.550
The difference between
internal energy and

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.030
temperature is the scaling
factor, 3/2 times the number

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.430
of molecules, times our
ideal gas constant.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.510
So fair enough.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.950
I went through this whole
exercise just to show you that

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.280
if I was completely isolated,
and if I removed a couple of

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.720
these pebbles, that
my temperature

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.350
is going to go down.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.300
Now, I told you already
that I want to do

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.640
an isothermic process.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.010
So I want to do this process
while keeping the

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.440
temperature the same.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.600
So how can I do that?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.300
Well, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to place my system

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.180
on top of what we'll
call, a reservoir.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.450
So a reservoir, you can kind of
view as an infinitely large

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.220
amount of something that is
the temperature that we

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.980
started off with.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.960
So this reservoir is T1.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.810
So even though if, I took
two relative things

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.060
of comparable size.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.430
That says, temperature A.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.360
This is temperature B.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.840
And I've put them next
to each other.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.360
They're going to average out to
A plus B over 2, whatever

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.090
their temperatures are.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:08.770
But if B is massive-- if A is
just a speck of particle--

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.800
let's say it's iron dust-- while
B is the Eiffel Tower,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.610
then essentially B's
temperature will

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.520
not change a lot.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.630
A will just become
B's temperature.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.690
Now, a reservoir is

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.050
theoretically infinitely large.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.950
It's an infinitely
large object.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.600
So if something is next to a
reservoir and is given enough

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.060
time, it'll always assume the
heat of the reservoir, or the

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.650
temperature of the reservoir.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.960
So what's going to happen?

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.130
So this is adiabatic, but now
I'm actually putting it next

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.010
to a reservoir.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.090
So this isn't going to happen.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.630
The adiabatic situation
isn't going to happen.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.130
Now, I'm going to have a
situation where I'm going to

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.470
stay the same temperature.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.770
So what's that going to look
like on the PV diagram?

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.060
So let me draw the PV diagram.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.470
This is my pressure.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.050
This is my volume.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.770
So this is my starting
point right here.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.580
And what I'm saying is, if I'm
doing an isothermic process,

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.970
so I just keep removing
these pebbles.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.950
So I start at this
state right here.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.800
Let me copy and paste it
since I've done so

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.380
much art already here.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:24.430
So I'm going from there to
here where I'm removing a

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.680
couple of the particles.

00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:30.980
So let's say I've removed a
couple of them over here.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.760
And because of that, I've
increased the volume.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.870
So let's say the volume,
it's not there anymore.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.020
Let's say it's a little
bit higher.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.720
Let's say the volume is--
just for the sake of our

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.530
discussion-- let's say the
volume has expanded a little

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.159
bit, because I've remove some
particles, the little pebbles

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.870
on the top keeping it down.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:48.880
So it's like the adiabatic
process, but instead of the

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.990
temperature going down, my
temperature stays at T1.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.040
My temperature's at T1 the
entire time, because I'm next

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.550
to this theoretical thing
called a reservoir.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.090
So because of that, I will
travel along what we'll call

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:04.420
an isotherm.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.060
So this is my first state.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.120
When I'm done, I might end
up some place over here.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.380
And so this is state 2.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.880
So this is state 2,
this is state 1.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.530
What I'm claiming is that my
path along this is going to be

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.550
on some type of a rectangular
hyperbola, or at

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.550
least part of it.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:27.620
If I were to add rocks to it and
compress it, I claim that

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.920
my PV diagram would
go like this.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.030
If I were to keep removing rocks
from this diagram, I

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.425
claim that my PV diagram would
keep going like that.

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:36.810
And so what's the intuition?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.280
That if I keep the temperature
constant, that I'm essentially

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.840
moving along this hyperbola.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.000
Well, let's just take out
the ideal gas formula.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.020
Let me box off all this
stuff over here.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:54.180
If I just take the ideal gas
formula, PV is equal to nRT.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.530
If T is constant-- we know that
R is a constant, it's the

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.950
ideal gas constant.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.706
We know that we're not changing
the number of moles

00:10:00.706 --> 00:10:01.710
of particles.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.170
Then that means that PV is
equal to some constant.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.140
This whole thing is equal
to some constant.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.260
And then, if we wanted to write
P as a function of V, we

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.550
would just write P is
equal to K over V.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.200
Now, this might not look 100%
familiar to you, but if I

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.100
wrote it in algebraic terms,
if I told you to graph y is

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.150
equal to 1 over x, what
does that look like?

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.580
That's a rectangular
hyperbola.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.995
That looks like this.

00:10:25.995 --> 00:10:29.350
And this is the y-axis, that's
the x-axis, at least in this

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.710
quadrant it looks like this.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.980
It also looks like that in the
third quadrant, but we won't

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.550
worry about that too much.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.420
So whenever you hold temperature
constant, you're

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.260
on some rectangular hyperbola
like this, like an isotherm.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.150
Now, if the temperature was a
different temperature, if it

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.180
was a lower temperature, you'd
be on a different isotherm.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.910
So you would be on an isotherm
that looked like

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.060
this, maybe over here.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.710
It would also be a rectangular
hyperbola

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.130
but at a lower state.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.060
Why is that?

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:04.020
Because, if you're at a lower
temperature, for any volume,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.910
you should have a lower pressure
and that works out.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.070
That's why this is some
temperature T2, that

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.630
is lower than T1.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.480
So I want to do a couple of
things in this video.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.240
I inadvertently explained to you
what an adiabatic process

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.940
is, and why the temperature
would naturally go down on its

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.870
own if you didn't have
this reservoir here.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.920
But the whole reason why I even
thought about doing this

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.240
video is because I wanted you
get comfortable with this idea

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.720
of, one, that a reservoir will
keep you in kind of an

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.880
isothermic state.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.610
It will keep the temperature
the same.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.920
And that if you keep the
temperature the same, that you

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.940
will travel along this isotherm,
these rectangular

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.600
hyperbolas.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.860
And that each temperature has

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.340
associated with it an isotherm.

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.740
So if you take that, let's
just do one more step.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:53.420
And let's think about the
actual work we did by

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.470
traveling from this state
to this state.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.720
Or if you just want to think
of it in visual terms, from

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.220
removing our pebbles slowly and
slowly with this reservoir

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.420
down here the whole time, from
this state to this state.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.050
Where our volume has increased,
our pressure has--

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.080
So our volume has increased.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.300
Our pressure has gone down. but
our temperature has stayed

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.840
the same the entire time.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.120
So, several videos ago, we
learned that the work done is

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.810
the area under this graph.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.410
It's the area under
that graph.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.480
Or, if we want to do in calculus
terms-- and I'm about

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.290
to break into calculus, so if
you don't want to see calculus

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.300
cover your eyes or ears.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.510
It would be the integral.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.730
And the rest of this video will
be a little bit mathy,

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:39.430
and I guess I should make
that statement on the

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.450
title of the video.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.130
But if I want to calculate
what this area is,

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.230
I can now do this.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.130
The isotherm assumption makes
our math a little bit easier.

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:55.410
Because we know that PV is equal
to nRT, ideal gas law.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.150
Or we could say P, if we divide
both sides by V, is

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.740
equal to nRT, divided by V.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.580
So there we have it.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.800
We have P as a function of V.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.470
This function right here, this
graph right here, is this.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.450
We could write P as a function
of v is equal to nRT over V.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.990
So if we want to figure out the
area under the curve, we

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:21.570
just integrate this function
from our starting, our V1 to

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.340
our ending point, to our V2.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.190
So what is that going to be?

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.695
Well, we're going to integrate
from V1 to V2.

00:13:29.695 --> 00:13:31.860
Actually, that shouldn't
be an equal.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.510
The work is going to be the
integral from V1 to V2, times

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:42.050
our function, P as a function
of V, times dV.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.560
We're summing up all of the
little rectangles here.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.550
We did that a couple
of videos ago.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.420
So what's P as a
function of V?

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:56.870
So work done is equal to,
from V1 to V2, nRT

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.700
over V, times dV.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.620
Now, this is our simplifying
assumption.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.070
We said we're sitting on
top of a reservoir.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.150
That this reservoir keeps
our temperature the

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.160
same the whole time.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.360
And we're going to learn in a
second, it's doing that by

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.130
transferring heat
into the system.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.270
And we're going to calculate how
much heat is transferred

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.770
into the system.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.970
So, if we look at this right
here, temperature-- since

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.310
we're assuming we're on an
isotherm, is a constant. n and

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.940
R are definitely constants.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.330
So we can rewrite this integral
as the integral from

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:34.380
V1 to V2 of 1 over V, dV.

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.140
And then we could put
the nRT out here.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.950
I should have done that
first. nRT, it's

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.910
just a constant term.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.920
Now, what's the antiderivative
of 1 over V?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.780
It's the natural log of V.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:53.970
So our work is equal to nRT
times the natural log-- this

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:59.180
is the antiderivative-- of V,
evaluated at V2 minus it

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.890
evaluated at V1.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:08.730
So that is equal to nRT times,
evaluated at V2, so the

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.370
natural log of V2.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.890
Minus the natural log of V1.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.210
Now we know from logarithm
properties is the same thing

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:26.010
as nRT times the natural
log of V2 over V1.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.310
So there you have
it, we actually

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.670
calculated the real value.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:32.760
If we know our starting volume
and our finishing volume, we

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.840
can actually figure out
the work done in

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.960
this isothermic process.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.760
The work done in this isothermic
process is the area

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.730
under this.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.560
And we figured out
what it was.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.630
By pushing up that piston,
it was nRT.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.800
These are the number of moles
we have, ideal gas constant.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.460
Our temperature that
we're sitting on.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.140
It would be T1 in this case.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.730
And the natural log of our
finishing volume divided by

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.570
our starting volume.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.920
Now, let me ask a follow-up
question.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.350
How much heat was put into the
system by this isotherm here?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.540
It put in heat to keep the
temperature up, otherwise the

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.980
temperature would have
gone down, right?

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.660
Heat was going into the system
the entire time.

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.190
How much was it?

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.600
Well, since it's an isotherm,
since the temperature did not

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.370
change, what do we know about
the internal energy?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.910
Did the internal
energy change?

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:26.060
The temperature not changing
told us that the kinetic

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.875
energy didn't change.

00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:29.590
If the kinetic energy didn't
change, then the internal

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.820
energy did not change.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.950
And we know that the change in
internal energy is equal to

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.570
the heat put into the
system minus the

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.100
work done by the system.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.250
Now, if this is 0-- so we know
that this didn't change,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.180
because the temperature
didn't change.

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:55.700
So that means 0 is equal
to Q minus W, or that

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.500
Q is equal to W.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.520
So this is the work done
by the system.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.920
You'll end up getting
something in joules.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.839
And this is also equal to the
heat put into the system.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.240
It's also equal to Q.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.450
So when you look at this, if we
were to just draw this part

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:17.119
of the curve-- let me redraw it
just to make things neat.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.390
I want to give you a little bit
of the convention of what

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.724
people in the thermodynamics
world tend to do.

00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:26.160
I'll make a neat drawing here.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.470
We started here, at state 1.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.210
And we moved along this
rectangular hyperbola, which

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.550
is an isotherm, to state 2.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.770
And now we calculated the area
under this, which is the work

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.000
done, which was this
value right here.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.750
Let me write it there.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:50.750
It's nRT natural log
of V2 over V1.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.430
This is V2.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.990
This is V1.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.040
This whole axis, remember, was
the V-axis, volume axis.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.840
This axis here was the
pressure axis.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.400
And the convention is that
because we did work, but we

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.340
were constant temperature, so
our internal energy didn't

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.510
change, we had to add energy to
the system to make up for

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.700
the work we did.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.170
So some heat must have been
added to the system.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.760
And then what they do is they
just put this little downward

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.720
arrow and they write
a Q right there.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:21.450
So some heat was put into the
system during this isothermic

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:22.450
process right there.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:26.840
And the value of that Q is
equivalent to the work we did.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.740
We put the exact amount of heat
into the system as the

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.190
work that was performed.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.590
And because of that, our
internal energy didn't change.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.660
Or you could say our temperature
didn't change.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.380
Or you could go the other way.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.350
Because our temperature didn't
change, these two things have

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.530
to be equal.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.860
Anyway, I want to
leave you there.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.140
Hopefully I gave you a little
bit more of an intuition of

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.410
how PV diagrams work, a little
bit more intuition behind what

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.290
isotherms and adiabatic mean.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.680
And the most important thing is,
once we get a little bit

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.630
mathy, this result can be useful
for coming up with

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.720
other interesting things about a
lot of these thermal systems

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.000
that we're dealing with.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.860
See you in the next video.
