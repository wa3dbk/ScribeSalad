00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.170
Like we did with parabolic mirrors, what I really want to do in this video

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.800
is just for put objects at different distances relative to this convex lens

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.920
and just think about what its image will look like

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.950
And the whole point of doing that is going through all the different situations but

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.990
more is getting practice of how to think about it

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.340
So let's first put an object out here

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.540
That's more than two focal lengths away from the lens

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.720
I'll put the object right here

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.670
We'll do our classic arrow

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.280
Actually I'll make a point here. When we dealt with parabolic mirrors

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.100
we talked about the distance of two focal lengths being our center of curvature

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.480
Over here we're just gonna call it 2 focal length, because it's really not

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540
the center of curvature--

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.020
or this distance really isn't the radius of curvature of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.640
each of these curves. So we're just gonna call it 2 focal lengths

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.150
So with that said, let's actually try to figure out what the image of this thing would look like

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.710
as the light from it gets refracted through this lens

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.390
So like always, it's useful to draw one ray

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.690
Every point of this object is emitting rays in every direction

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.830
because it's diffusely reflecting light

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.320
So we can just pick rays that are convenient

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.280
So we can go from the tip of the arrow

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.360
and go parallel to our principal axis just like that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.470
I'm not gonna show all the internal refraction within this lens right here

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.270
But we know that if we enter the lens, parallel to the principal axis

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:41.630
when we get refracted, we will go through the focal point on the other side of the lens

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.100
And on the left side of the lens

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.340
we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:59.770
and then comes out parallel

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.530
The incident ray goes through the left focal point

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.710
and when it gets refracted, it will now be parallel

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:18.790
And so the light that came from that point of the object will reconverge right over here

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.530
So if you did this for every point of this object

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.310
if you did a point in the middle right over here, it would reconverge right over here

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.100
If you did this point right over here, it would reconverge right over there

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.170
So the image of this object is going to look like this

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.220
So it's going to be a real image. The rays actually converge here. So it's a real inverted image

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.980
It was pointing up before. Now it's pointing that down

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.370
And in this situation, it's actually going to be smaller than the original

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.700
So, real, smaller, inverted image

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.270
Let's do a couple of other scenarios

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.580
Let me copy and paste this before starting this video to save on time

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.910
Let's do a situation now where the object is at the 2 focal distances. I guess we can call that

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.430
Let's put the object right over here

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.850
We can do the exact same thing

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.470
You might want to do it on paper on your own to get some practice doing it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.960
We'll do one ray that's parallel

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.560
When it gets refracted, it will go through the focal point on the other side

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.750
And then we'll do another ray that goes through the focal point on the left side

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.110
and then it will become parallel

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.080
And they can reconverge or they converge right over there

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
So you can see that this is actually a parallelogram

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.490
This distance right there is going to be the same thing as that distance over here

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.690
It is actually--I don't want to say symmetry. You can't flip it over

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.190
But this is a--and this distance right over here is going to be the same

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.080
thing as this distance over here. I won't go into all the geometry

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:17.210
Anyway, this would be an inverted image of exactly the same size at the exact same distance

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.780
Actually I didn't talk about distance in this one over here

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.340
Over here, it's a real image; it's smaller and it's also going to be closer in

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.150
than this one was. It's gonna be closer to lens

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.090
But here the image is going to be the same size as the original object

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.620
It's going to be inverted, but it's going to be at the same distance from the lens

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.470
just on the other side. Once again this is a real image

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.920
Let's do another one

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.810
Copy and paste

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.480
So let's stick something between one focal length and two focal lengths

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:03.020
So what's put my object right over there

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.600
So once again, let's go parallel

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.460
then we will refract through the focus on the other side

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.250
And then let's go through the focus on the left side

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.330
And then we will refract and go parallel

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.830
So here, we will have--remember, I could use any point. Here I just used the tip

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.250
because I know the base will converge over there

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.410
If I took 2 points, it would go converge right back there

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.760
And then if I did with a point right here

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.360
and I did that same exercise, it would go right over there

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.150
And so the whole image would show up over here

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.580
So here, it's real; it's inverted; and it's larger

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.220
and it is now further away from the lens than the object on the other side

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.020
This is really kind of the reverse of the first example

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.210
The first example, the object was larger and more than two focal lengths away

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.250
and the image was in this range

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.870
Now the object is here and now the image's on the other side. So they're kind of--

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.790
that's really just the other side of that first examples

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.850
Let's do a couple more

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:27.070
So let's put the object at the focal point and see what would happen

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.310
And sometimes people memorize this type of things for physics exams

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.310
You don't need to. All you have to do is remember just think about 2 rays

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.830
usually from the tip of the arrow that gives you a sense what the image will look like

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.380
and you do one parallel and one that goes through the focal point

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.800
Well, with that said

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.340
we're gonna do something slightly different when something is sitting at the focal point

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.910
When something is sitting at the focal point

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.130
one is we can do the parallel

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.660
It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.920
And then instead of doing a ray that goes through the focal point on this side

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.130
because actually you can't. You're sitting on the focal point right there

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.610
Let's do a ray that does not get refracted. We did a similar thing with the parabolic mirrors

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.920
What I want do is a ray that'll go right to the center of the lens

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.450
where it won't get refracted

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.260
It's just go straight through the center of the lens

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:35.440
So what you have here is, both of these rays that were diverging from this point from this tip

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.100
they don't reconverge anywhere

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.690
And they don't even look like they're diverging from another point

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.050
if someone's eyeball is right over here

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.010
They're just going to see these as 2 parallel rays of light

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.820
So no image will form. Not a real image or virtual image

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.920
So we can say no image is going to form

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:08.290
Now the last case is, let's put the object less than one focal distance away

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:16.880
Let's put the object right over here. And think about what happens

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.520
Once again, the light ray from this tip

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.390
where to go parallel. It will be refracted through the focal point on the other side

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.720
And then let's do another light ray, going

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.590
in a direction as if it were coming the direction of the focal point on this side

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.270
So it comes from that direction

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.230
The light ray would go like that

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.790
And then it would come out on the other side parallel

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.300
So clearly, these two light rays are not converging

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.560
So no real image's going to form

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:51.390
But they do look like they're diverging from some point

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:59.350
Continue these lines. They both look like they're coming from a point right over there

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.020
So what's going to happen? If someone's eyes are processing these light rays

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.880
they're gonna see the tip of this arrow all the way up here

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:11.200
They're gonna see the base of this arrow down here

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:29.700
And essentially, they're going to see a magnified virtual image of the actual arrow

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.720
Anyway, hopefully you found that interesting
