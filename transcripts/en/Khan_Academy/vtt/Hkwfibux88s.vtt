00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.870
We're asked to write 7/8 as a
decimal and as a percent.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.620
We'll start off with a decimal,
and we'll see it's

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.260
pretty easy to go from a
decimal to a percent.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.660
Now, whenever you see a problem
like this, it's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.510
sometimes confusing.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.000
It's like, how do I even get
it into a decimal, or as a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.380
fraction over 100, or
as a percentage?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.160
And you always have to remember
7 over 8, or 7/8, is

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.490
the exact same thing.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.090
This means literally
7 divided by 8.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.830
Not 8 divided by 7.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.180
7 divided by 8.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.580
The numerator divided
by the denominator.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.260
And you say, well, how do I
turn that into a decimal?

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.010
Well, we just literally do a
long division problem, but we

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.410
keep going behind the decimal
point, so that we don't end up

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.860
with a remainder, or until we
end up with things repeating.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.540
You'll see what we mean.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.330
In this case, we won't end up
with anything repeating.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.790
So let's try this out.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.555
So it's 7 divided by 8.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.910
So how many times does
8 go into 7?

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.530
Well, 8 does not go into 7.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.250
It goes zero times.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.180
And actually, just so that we
make sure that everything's

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.280
clean, let's put our decimal.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.020
You can view this as
8 going into 7.000.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.940
You can keep adding as many
zeroes as you need until

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.130
you're done dividing.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.970
So we have our decimal point
right here, right behind the 7

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.640
where it was up here.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.230
So we say 8 goes into
7 zero times.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.090
0 times 8 is 0.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.410
You subtract.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.520
7 minus 0 is 7.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.980
Now we can bring down a 0.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.230
We bring down a 0.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.570
It becomes 70.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.010
And then you say 8 goes into
70 how many times?

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.370
Well, 8 times 8 is 64,
so that works.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.950
8 times 9 is 72.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.980
That's too big.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.230
So it goes into it
eight times.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.250
8 times 8 is 64.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.060
When you subtract,
70 minus 64 is 6.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.080
You still have a remainder,
so let's keep going.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.260
Let's bring down another 0.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.580
So you bring down another 0
right over there, and so you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.520
say, how many times
does 8 go into 60?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.480
8 times 8 is 64, so
that's too big.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.670
8 times 7 is 56, so
that'll work.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.680
So it goes into 60
seven times.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.800
7 times 8 is 56.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.010
You subtract.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.300
60 minus 56 is 4.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.780
So we still have a remainder,
so let's keep bringing down

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.970
some zeroes.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.210
So let's bring this
0 down here.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.710
And 8 goes into 40
how many times?

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.690
Well, 8 times 5 is 40, so it
goes in nice and evenly.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.400
So it goes into it five times.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.880
5 times 8 is 40.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.890
Subtract.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.200
No remainder.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.450
So as a decimal, we just figured
out that 7/8, which is

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.820
equal to 7 divided by
8, is exactly 0.875.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.390
So 7/8 as a decimal
is equal to 0.875.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.490
Now we've done the
decimal part.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.200
Now the next thing is
to do a percent.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.520
And if you have it as a decimal,
doing it as a percent

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.160
is very easy.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.440
You literally shift the decimal
place two to the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.280
right, and you put a
percent sign there.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.930
And I think it makes
sense why it works.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.520
Now you're going to say,
how many per hundred?

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.600
You can view this as
875 thousandths.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.430
Let me write this down.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:35.800
You can view this
as a fraction.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.050
You could say, well, this is the
same thing as 875/1,000.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.620
That's how we've read it in
the past. This is the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
thousandths spot right here.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.340
Or you could read this
as 87.5/100.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.570
If you just go two decimal
places, it's 87.5/100.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.060
Or if you just took this, and
you divide the numerator and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.170
the denominator by 10,
you would get this.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.700
And this is literally saying
87.5 per 100, So this second

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.195
statement right here, this is
literally saying 87.5 per

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:15.560
hundred, or per cent.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.440
So this is equal to 87.5%.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.560
So that gives you the reasoning
for why it works,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.300
but the really easy way, if you
have a decimal, to make it

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.710
into a percent, you literally
multiply the number by 100 and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.820
put the percent there, which
is essentially telling you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.090
that you're going to divide by
100, so you're multiplying and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.040
dividing by 100.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.460
So if you multiply this by 100,
which is equivalent to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.520
shifting the decimal place two
places to the right, that

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.570
literally would become
87.5, then you

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.630
want to put the percent.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.310
This says this is going
to be over 100.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.360
So you multiply by 100, and
then divide by 100.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.510
You're not really changing
the number.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.010
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.820
Another way to remember, because
sometimes you might

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.280
get confused-- Do I put the
decimal to the right?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.550
Do I take it to the left--
is that the decimal

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.890
representation will always be
smaller than the percent

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.940
representation.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.820
And not only will it be smaller,
but it will be

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.060
smaller by exactly
a factor of 100.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.870
This is 100 times smaller
of a number right here

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.910
than just the 87.5.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.980
Obviously, when you put this
percent here, these become the

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.390
exact same number.
