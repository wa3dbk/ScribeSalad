00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.700
A bead artist drills a tiny hole
from the top corner of a

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.110
cube bead to the opposite bottom
corner of that bead.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.450
It's a cube bead.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.130
Each edge of the bead
is 1/2 centimeters.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.910
How long is the hole
that she drilled?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.280
So if I'm interpreting this
properly, let me draw that

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.590
cube bead, which I will
just draw as a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.080
cube, a big cube here.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.750
Nicer cubes have been drawn in
the history of cube drawing,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.540
but I'll try my best.
So let's see.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.140
This is my best shot
at a freehand cube.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.730
I think that does the
job reasonably well.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.170
If this cube was transparent,
you could even imagine kind of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.030
that backside over there, and
the base of the cube if this

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.680
was a transparent cube.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.050
They tell us that each edge of
this cube bead-- they call

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.910
this a cube bead-- each edge
of the cube bead is 1/2

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.450
centimeter.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.080
So this is 1/2 centimeters, this
is 1/2 centimeters, and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.030
that is 1/2 centimeters.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.480
And then they say that they
drilled a hole from the top

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680
corner of a cube bead to
the opposite bottom

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.590
corner of the bead.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.430
From the top corner to
the opposite bottom.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.160
So I think they're talking about
the longest diagonal

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.530
that can fit in the cube.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.480
Going from the back, right top
corner, over here, to the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.100
front, left bottom corner, right
over there, that's the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.640
longest diagonal
that could fit.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.670
So let me draw that.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.130
So it would look something
like this.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.100
This is the distance
in question.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.810
How long is the hole
that she drilled?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.390
That is the distance that
we have to figure out.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.120
And let's see how we can
think about that.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.330
And this is a bit of a
classic in terms of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.210
figuring out a distance.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.650
The longest diagonal of
a cube or some type of

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.050
a rectangular prism.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.180
And the trick here is to see
that this is the hypotenuse of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.560
a triangle, although the
triangle isn't completely

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.270
obvious to you just yet.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.660
And to think about this as
the hypotenuse of a right

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.770
triangle, what you have to do
is visualize the diagonal of

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440
the bottom face of this cube.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.400
Think about this diagonal right
here that I'm drawing.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.850
So the diagonal of the bottom
face of this cube.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.720
If you think of it that way,
then all of a sudden we have a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.790
right triangle that's kind of
going across this cube.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.560
This is a right angle
over here.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.070
We know what this length is.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.380
This is 1/2 centimeters.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.030
If we could figure out the
length of this orange side

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.020
right here, this part that's
going diagonally across the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.370
base of the cube, then we could
use the Pythagorean

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.080
theorem to figure out what the
distance in question is, this

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.930
longest diagonal of the cube.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.960
Now, to figure out this orange
side, you just have to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.830
visualize the base
of this cube.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.700
Let's look at this base.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.600
If we were just in the cube
looking straight down at the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.380
base, it would look something
like this.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.600
You'd have this side-- let me
color code them; it will make

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.470
it easier to visualize I think--
you have this side

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.155
right here, which I will
do in this blue color.

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:47.920
So I'll draw it over here.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.100
You have this side in
that blue color.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.000
And then you have this side over
here, which I'll do in

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.650
the magenta color.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.470
You have the side over there
in the magenta color.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.310
They're both of length 1/2, so
I'll draw them with roughly

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.650
the same length.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070
And then you have this orange
side that goes across to the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.220
bottom of the base
of the cube.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.080
And I'll do it as the same
orange dotted line right

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.175
there, just like that.

00:03:12.175 --> 00:03:14.400
Let me extend this side
a little bit.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.000
And we know this is
a right angle.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.987
This is a cube we're
dealing with, so

00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:19.000
this is a right angle.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.690
We know that this side
is 1/2 centimeter.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.000
We know that this side right
over here is 1/2 centimeter.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.810
So if we wanted to figure out
this diagonal or this length

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.540
right here, we can just use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.780
We know that 1/2 squared-- if we
called this, I don't know,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.730
if we called this right here
x-- we know that x squared,

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.860
the hypotenuse squared, is equal
to the the sum of the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.640
squares of these two guys,
is equal to 1/2

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.890
squared plus 1/2 squared.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.890
Or if we want to solve for x, we
could say x is equal to the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.535
square root-- what's
this going to be?

00:03:56.535 --> 00:04:01.210
The square root of 1/4, That's
1/2 squared, plus 1/2 squared,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.680
which is 1/4.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.530
Or, what's 1/4 plus 1/4?

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.100
So x is equal to the square root
of 1/4 plus 1/4, that's

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.770
2/4, or 1/2.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.910
Or you could write that as 1
over the square root of 2.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.990
Now, we could rationalize this,
but I'll leave it like

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.589
that for now.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:20.990
It'll keep things simple.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.550
So this distance right here is
1 over the square root of 2,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.780
or we could say this distance
right over here is 1 over the

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.620
square root of 2.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.900
So if we were to draw the
right triangle where the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.810
hypotenuse is the length of that
hole, let me draw that

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.910
right triangle.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.070
So we have our hypotenuse,
which is this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.660
long thing over here.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.980
Let me just draw it like this.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.490
That long thing over there.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.780
We have this side over
here in yellow.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.600
This side right here.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.970
We have that side right there.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.510
It is of length 1/2
centimeters.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.840
And then we have the side we
just figured out, this side

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.250
right here, that x side.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.500
This right over here.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.690
This side over here, it
is a right angle.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.490
We just figured out
this length.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.510
It is 1 over the square
root of 2 centimeters.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.250
Now, to figure out the length of
the hole, we can apply the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.370
Pythagorean theorem again.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.360
This is, let me say
h for hole.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.050
Length of hole.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.720
Actually, even better,
let's say l.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.500
l for length.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.070
Then we can say that l squared
is going to be equal to 1 over

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.510
the square root of 2 squared--
we're just applying the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.920
Pythagorean theorem--
plus 1 squared.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.370
And once again, we know that
this is the longest side.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.220
It's opposite the right angle.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.200
So it's going to be the
sum of the squares of

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.730
the other two sides.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.480
And so that's going to be equal
to-- so we get l squared

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.500
is equal to-- what's 1 over the
square root of 2 squared?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.785
Well, 1 squared is 1, over the
square root of 2 squared is 2.

00:05:58.785 --> 00:06:02.070
And then you're going to
have plus 1/2 squared.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.860
1/2 squared is plus 1/4.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.020
So l squared is equal
to 1/2 plus 1/4.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.140
1/2 plus 1/4 is what?

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.920
Let's do it over here.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.570
1/2-- we can write it as 2/4--
plus 1/4 is equal to 3/4.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.000
So this right here
is equal to 3/4.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.200
So we have l squared-- I changed
the shades of green

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.240
just there-- is equal to 3 over
4, so l is equal to the

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.330
square root of 3 over 4.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.480
So we take the square root of
both sides, you get l is equal

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.930
to the square root of 3 over
the square root of 4.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.240
What's the square root of 4?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.660
The square root of 4 is 2.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.910
And we're done.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.910
The length of the hole that was
drilled in this bead from

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.000
this corner over here all the
way over here is the square

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.320
root of 3 over 2 centimeters.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.080
Because everything we've been
dealing with has been

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.330
centimeters.
