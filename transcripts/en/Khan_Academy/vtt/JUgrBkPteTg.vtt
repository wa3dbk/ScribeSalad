00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.640
We've seen in several videos
that the column space of a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.410
matrix is pretty straightforward
to find.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.380
In this situation the column
space of A is just equal to

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.170
all of the linear combinations
of the column vectors of A.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.690
Another way of saying all of
the linear combinations is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.430
just the span of each of
these column vectors.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.930
So if we call this one
right here a1.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.050
This is a2, a3, a4.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.620
This is a5.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.200
Then the column space of A is
just equal to the span of a1,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.430
a2, a3, a4, and a5.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.560
Fair enough.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.260
But a more interesting question
is whether these guys

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.300
form a basis for the
column space.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.680
Or even more interesting, what
is the basis for the column

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.450
space of A?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.080
And in this video I'm going
to show you a method for

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.620
determining the basis, and along
the way we'll get an

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.130
intuition for maybe
why it works.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.540
And if I have time, actually I
probably won't have time in

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.580
this video.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.980
In the next video I'll prove
to you why it works.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.280
So we want to figure out
the basis for the

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.960
column space of A.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.150
Remember the basis just means
that vectors span, C, A.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.730
Clearly these vectors span
our column space.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.150
I mean the span of these vectors
is the column space.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.420
But in order to be a basis, the
vectors also have to be

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.590
linearly, let me just write,
linearly independent.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.120
And we don't know whether these
guys or what subset of

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.990
these guys are linearly
independent.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.050
So what you do-- and I'm just
really going to describe the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.930
process here, as opposed to the
proof-- is you put this

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.790
guy in reduced row
echelon form.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.310
So let's do that.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.600
So let me see if
we can do that.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.610
Let's keep our first
row the same.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.670
1, 0.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.840
Let me do it actually in the
right side right here.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.250
So let's keep the first
row the same.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.490
1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.240
And then let's replace our
second row with the second row

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.260
minus 2 times the first row.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.825
So then our second row.

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:21.100
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.530
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.350
0 minus 2 times negative
1, so that's 0 plus 2.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.800
0 minus 2 times 0 is just 0.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.570
And then 9 minus
2 times 4 is 1.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.620
Fair enough.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.770
Now we want to zero
out this guy.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.400
Well it seems like a pretty
straightforward way.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.590
Just replace this row with this
row plus the first row.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.920
So minus 1 plus 1 is 0.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.420
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.000
5 minus 1 is 4.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.730
1 plus 0 is 1.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.290
Minus 5 plus 4 is minus 1.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.330
And then finally we got this guy
right here, and in order

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.910
to zero him out, let's
replace him with him

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.210
minus the first row.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.120
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.750
Minus 1 minus 0 is minus 1.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.690
Minus 3 minus negative 1, that's
minus 3 plus 1, so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.540
that's minus 2.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.900
Minus 2 minus 0 is minus 2.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.360
And then 9 minus 4 is 5.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360
So we did one round.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.600
We got our first pivot
column going.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.420
Now let's do another round
of row operations.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.090
Well we want to zero all
of these guys out.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.930
Luckily this is already 0.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.100
So we don't have to change our
first row or our second row.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.490
So we get 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.980
Our second row becomes
0, 1, 2, 0, 1.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.880
And now let us see if we can
eliminate this guy right here.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.580
And let's do it by replacing our
blue row, our third row,

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.760
with the third row minus
2 times the second row.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.600
So 0 minus 2 times 0 is 0.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.170
2 minus 2 times 1 is 0.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.630
4 minus 2 times 2 is 0.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.350
1 minus 2 times 0 is 1.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.660
Minus 1 minus 2 times
1 is minus 3.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.870
All right.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.690
Now this last guy we want to
eliminate him, and we want

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.590
turn this into a 0.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.620
Let's replace this fourth row
with the fourth row plus the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.300
second row.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.690
So 0 plus 0 is 0.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.320
Minus 1 plus minus 1 is 0.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.920
Minus 2 plus minus 2 is 0.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.190
Minus 2 plus 0 is minus 2.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.070
And then 5 plus 1 is 6.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.950
We're getting close.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.050
So let's look at our
pivot entries.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.490
We have this is a pivot entry.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.900
That's a pivot entry.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.420
And this is not a pivot entry,
because it's following

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.500
obviously another.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.370
This guy is a pivot entry
right here, or will be.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.950
Zero this minus 2 out, and
I think we'll be done.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.830
So let me write my first row
just the way it is, because

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.090
everything above it is
0, so we don't have

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.790
to worry about it.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:38.110
So my first row I can just write
as 1, 0, minus 1, 0, 4.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.170
I can write my second
row, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.260
I can write my third row
as 0, 0, 0, 1 minus 3.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.830
And now let's replace
my fourth row.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.830
Let's replace it with it plus
2 times the second row.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.690
So 0 plus 2 times 0, 0 plus 2
times 0, 0 plus 2 times 0,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.270
minus 2 plus 2 times
1 is just 0.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.440
6 plus 2 times minus 3, that's
6 minus 6, that's just 0.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.570
And there we've actually put
our matrix in reduced row

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.560
echelon form.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.710
So let me put brackets
around it.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.570
It's not so bad if you just
kind of go and just do the

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.350
manipulations.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.410
And sometimes you kind of get
a headache thinking about

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.110
doing something like this,
but this wasn't too bad.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.980
So this is let me just say the
reduced row echelon form of A.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.010
Let me just call
that matrix R.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.520
So this is matrix
R right there.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.410
Now what do we see
about matrix R?

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.480
Well it has 3 pivot entries,
or 3 pivot columns.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.460
Let me square them out,
or circle them out.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.700
Column 1 is a pivot column,
column 2 is a pivot column,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.890
and column 3 is a
pivot column.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.340
And we've done this in
previous videos.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.040
There's two things
that you can see.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.140
These three columns are clearly
linearly independent.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.390
How do we know that?

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.220
And that's just with respect
to each other.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:14.060
If we just took a set of, let's
call this r1, r2, and

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.830
this would be r3, this would
be r4 right here.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:27.950
It's clear that the set r1,
r2, and r4 is linearly

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.335
independent.

00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:30.000
And you say why is that?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.110
Well look, our one's got a 1
here, while the other two have

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.550
a 0 in that entry, right?

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.430
And this is by definition
of pivot entries.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.890
Pivot entries have 0's, or
pivot columns have 0's

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.310
everywhere except for
where they have a 1.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.830
For any pivot column, it will be
the only pivot column that

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.210
has 0's there.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.170
Or it'll be the only pivot
column that has a 1 there.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.410
So there's no way that you can
add up combinations of these

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.230
guys to get a 1.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.950
You can say 100 times
0, minus 3, times 0.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.140
You're just going to
get a bunch of 0's.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.910
So no combination of these
two guys is going to be

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.270
equal to that guy.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.660
By the same reasoning, no
combination of that and that

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.680
is going to equal this.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.140
This is by definition
of a pivot entry.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.770
When you put it in reduced row
echelon form, it's very clear

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.870
that any pivot column will
be the only one to

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.950
have 1 in that place.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.970
So it's very clear that these
guys are linearly independent.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.300
Now it turns out, and I haven't
proven it to you, that

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.820
the corresponding columns in
A-- this is r1, but it's A

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.840
before we put it in reduced row
echelon form-- that these

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:41.380
guys right here, so a1, a2,
and a4 are also linearly

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.760
independent.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.440
So a1-- let me circle
it-- a2, and a4.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.570
So if I write it like this,
a1, a2, and a4.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.310
Let me write it in
set notation.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.170
These guys are also linearly
independant,

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.020
which I haven't proven.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.970
But I think you can kind of
get a sense that these row

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.960
operations really don't change
the sense of the matrix.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.380
And I'll do a better explanation
of this, but I

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.770
really just wanted you to
understand how to develop a

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.500
basis for the column space.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.700
So they're linearly
independent.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.310
So the next question is do they
span our column space?

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.970
And in order for them to span,
obviously all of these 5

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.470
vectors, if you have all of
them, that's going to span

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.290
your column space
by definition.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.590
But if we can show, and I'm not
going to show it in this

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.850
video, but it turns out that you
can always represent the

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:38.660
non-pivot columns as
linear combinations

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:40.870
of the pivot columns.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.260
And we've kind of touched on
that in previous videos where

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.220
we find a solution for the
null space and all that.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.740
So these guys can definitely
be represented as linear

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.880
combinations of these guys.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.230
I haven't shown you that, but
if you take that on faith,

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.415
then you don't need
that column and

00:09:57.415 --> 00:09:58.460
that column to span.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.970
If you did then, or I guess a
better way to think it, you

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.535
don't need them to span,
although they

00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:06.520
are part of the span.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.925
Because if you needed this guy,
you can just construct

00:10:08.925 --> 00:10:11.520
him with linear combinations
of these guys.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.100
So if you wanted to figure out
a basis for the column space

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.160
of A, you literally
just take A into

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.900
reduced row echelon form.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.600
You look at the pivot entries
in the reduced row echelon

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.450
form of A, and that's
those three.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.540
And then you look at the
corresponding columns to those

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.660
pivot columns in your
original A.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.020
And those form the basis.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.690
Because any linear combination
of them, or linear

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.470
combinations of them can be
used to construct the

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.410
non-pivot columns, and they're
linearly independant.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.490
So I haven't shown you that.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:47.350
But for this case, if you want
to know the basis, it's just

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.500
a1, a2, and a4.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.860
And now we can answer
another question.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:10.510
So a1, a2, and a4 form a basis
for the column space of A,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.910
because you can construct the
other two guys with linear

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.500
combinations of our basis
vectors, and they're also

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.060
linearly independent.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.970
Now the next question is what is
the dimension of the basis?

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.950
Or what is the dimension-- not
the dimension of the basis--

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.240
what is the dimension of
the column space of A?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.490
Well the dimension is just the
number of vectors in any basis

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.750
for the column space.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.110
And all bases have the same
number of vectors for any

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.120
given subspace.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.270
So we have 1, 2, 3 vectors.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:44.990
So the dimension of our column
space is equal to 3.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.000
And the dimension of a column
space actually has a specific

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.220
term for it, and that's
called the rank.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:54.690
So the rank of A, which is the
exact same thing as the

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.990
dimension of the column space,
it is equal to 3.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.460
And another way to think about
it is, the rank of A is the

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.840
number of linearly independent
column vectors that you have

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.470
that can span your entire
column space.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.140
Or the number of linearly
independent column vectors

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.300
that can be used to construct
all of the

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.930
other column vectors.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.730
But hopefully this didn't
confuse you too much, because

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.140
the idea is very simple.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:25.940
Take A, put it into reduced row
echelon form, see which

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.090
columns are pivot columns.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.950
The corresponding columns are
going to be a basis for your

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.000
column space.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.340
If you want to know the rank for
your matrix, you can just

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.360
count them.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.860
Or if you don't want to count
those, you could literally

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.210
just count the number of pivot
columns you have in your

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.990
reduced row echelon form.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.570
So that's how you do it.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.480
In the next video I'll explain
why this worked.
