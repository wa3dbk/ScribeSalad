00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.480
So let's say I have a function
of x and y; f of x and y is

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.470
equal to x plus y squared.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.400
If I try to draw that,
let's see if I can have

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100
a good attempt at it.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.590
That is my y axis-- I'm going
to do a little perspective here

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.440
--this is my x axis-- I make do
the negative x and y axis,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.180
could do it in that direction
--this is my x axis here.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.150
And if I were to graph this
when y is 0, it's going to be

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.720
just a-- let me draw it in
yellow --is going to be just a

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.310
straight line that looks
something like that.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.050
And then for any given
actually, we're going to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.010
have a parabola in y.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.230
y is going to look
something like that.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.335
I'm just going to it in
the positive quadrant.

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:41.780
It's going to look
something like that.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.090
It'll actually, when you go
into the negative y, you're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.905
going to see the other half of
the parabola, but I'm not going

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:50.370
to worry about it too much.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.980
So you're going to
have this surface.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.190
it looks something like that.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.140
Maybe I'll do to another
attempt at drawing it.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.930
But this is our ceiling we're
going to deal with again.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.340
And then I'm going to have
a path in the xy plane.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.660
I'm going to start at the
point 2 comma 0. x is

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.430
equal to 2, y is 0.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.670
And I'm going to travel, just
like we did in the last video,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.380
I'm going to travel along a
circle, but this time the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.630
circle's going to
have of radius 2.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.650
Move counter clockwise
in that circle.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.610
This is on the xy plane,
just to be able to

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.040
visualize it properly.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.500
So this right here's
a point 0, 2.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.055
And I'm going to come
back along the y axis.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:35.640
This is my path; I'm going to
come back along the y access

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
and then so I look a left here,
and then I'm going to take

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.640
another left here in and
come back along the x axis.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.540
I drew it in these
two shades of green.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.680
That is my contour.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.830
And what I want to do is I want
to evaluate the surface area

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.260
of essentially this little
building that has the roof of f

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.020
of xy is equal to x plus y
squared, and I want to find the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.620
surface area of its walls.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.705
So you'll have this wall right
here, whose base is the x axis.

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.250
Then you're going to have this
wall, which is along the curve;

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.490
it's going to look something
like kind of funky wall on

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.410
that curved side right there.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550
I'll try my best effort to
try to-- it's going to be

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.510
curving way up like that
and then along the y axis.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.240
It's going to have like a half
a parabolic wall right there.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.150
I'll do that back wall
along the y axis.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.400
I'll do that in orange,
I'll use magenta.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.530
That is the back wall
along the y axis.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.660
Then you have this front
wall along the x axis.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.230
And then you have this weird
curvy curtain or wall-- do that

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.020
maybe in blue --that goes along
this curve right here, this

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.740
part of a circle of radius 2.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.890
So hopefully you get
that visualization.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.670
It's a little harder; I'm
not using any graphic

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.680
program at this time.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.900
But I want to figure out
the surface area, the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.270
combined surface area
of these three walls.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.390
And in very simple notation we
could say, well, the surface

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.430
area of those walls-- of this
wall plus that wall plus that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.570
wall --is going to be equal to
the line integral along this

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.020
curve, or along this contour--
however you want to call it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.820
--of f of xy,-- so that's x
plus y squared --ds, where ds

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.220
is just a little length
along our contour.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.450
And since this is a closed
loop, we'll call this a

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.500
closed line interval.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560
And we'll sometimes see
this notation right here.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.480
Often you'll see that
in physics books.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.870
And we'll be dealing
with a lot more.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.330
And we'll put a circle
on the interval sign.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.060
And all that means is that the
contour we're dealing with is a

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.750
closed contour; we get back
to where we started from.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.770
But how do we solve this thing?

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.660
A good place to start
is to just to find

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.630
the contour itself.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.830
And just to simply it, we're
going to divide it into three

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.040
pieces and it essentially just
do three separate

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.290
line integrals.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.770
Because you know, this isn't
a very continuous contour.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.050
so the first part.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.980
Let's do this first part of
the curve where we're going

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
along a circle of radius 2.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.770
And that's pretty easy to
construct if we have x-- let me

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.850
do each part of the contour in
a different color, so if I do

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.920
orange this part of the contour
--if we say that x is equal 2

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:39.440
cosine of t and y is equal to 2
sine of t and if we say that

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.680
t-- and this is really just
building off what we saw on the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.960
last video --if we say that t--
and that this is from t is a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.170
greater than or equal to 0 and
is less than or equal to pi

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.270
over 2 --t is essentially going
to be the angle that

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.200
we're going along the
circle right here.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.040
This will actually
describe this path.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.820
And if you know, how I
constructed this is little

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.980
confusing, you might want
to review the video on

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.860
parametric equations.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.360
So this is the first
part of our path.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.080
So if we just wanted to find
the surface area of that wall

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.940
right there, we know we're
going to have to find

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.670
dx, dt and dy, dt.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.970
So let's get that out
of the way right now.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:28.770
So if we say dx, dt is going to
be equal to minus 2, sine of t,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.495
dy, dy is going to be equal to
2 cosine of t; just the

00:05:34.495 --> 00:05:35.840
derivatives of these.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.350
We've seen that
many times before.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.290
So it we want this orange
wall's surface area, we can

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.675
take the integral-- and if any
of this is confusing, there are

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:47.400
two videos before this where we
kind of derive this formula

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.170
--but we could take the
integral from t is equal to 0

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:59.260
to pi over 2 our function of x
plus y squared and

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.610
then times the ds.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.570
So x plus y squared will
give the height of

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:04.550
each little block.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.360
And then we want to get the
width of each little block,

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.690
which is ds, but we know that
we can rewrite the ds as the

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.930
square root-- give myself some
room right here --of dx of the

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.310
derivative of x with respect to
t squared-- so that is minus 2

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.160
sine of t squared --plus
the derivative of y with

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.660
respect to t squared, dt.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.050
This will give us the orange
section, and then we can worry

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.820
about the other two walls.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.410
And so how can we
simplify this?

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.670
Well, this is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to pi

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:55.000
over 2 of x plus y squared.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.180
And actually, let me write
everything in terms of t.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.250
So x is equal to 2 cosine of t.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.910
So let me write that down.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:13.310
So it's 2 cosine of t plus y,
which is 2 sine of t, and we're

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.830
going to square everything.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.780
And then all of that times
this crazy radical.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.880
Right now it looks like a hard
antiderivative or integral to

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.780
solve, but I we'll find
out it's not too bad.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.380
This is going to be equal to
4 sine squared of t plus

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.380
4 cosine squared of t.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.020
We can factor a 4 out.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.450
I don't want to forget the dt.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.820
This over here-- let me just
simplify this expression so I

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.260
don't have to keep
rewriting it.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.820
That is the same thing is
the square root of 4 times

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.650
sine squared of t plus
cosine squared of t.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.800
We know what that
is: that's just 1.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.516
So this whole thing just
simplifies to the square

00:07:56.516 --> 00:07:58.650
root of 4, which is just 2.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.120
So this whole thing simplifies
to 2, which is nice for

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.290
solving our antiderivative.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.860
That means simplifying
things a lot.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.620
So this whole thing simplifies
down to-- I'll do it over here.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.320
I don't want to waste too much
space; I have two more walls to

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.760
figure out --the integral from
t is equal to 0 to pi over 2.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.660
I want to make it very clear.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.700
I just chose the simplest
parametrization I

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.080
could for x and y.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.630
But I could have picked
other parametrizations, but

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.250
then I would have had to
change t accordingly.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.200
So as long as you're consistent
with how you do it, it

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.020
should all work out.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.290
There isn't just one
parametrization for this curve;

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.130
it's kind of depending on how
fast you want to go

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.140
along the curve.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.450
Watch the parametric functions
videos if you want a little

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:40.900
bit more depth on that.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.860
Anyway, this thing simplifies.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.400
We have a 2 here; 2 times
cosine of t, that's

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.720
4 cosine of t.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.500
And then here we have 2 sine
squared sine of t squared.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.430
So that's 4 sine squared of t.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.230
And then we have to multiply
times this 2 again, so

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.970
that gives us an 8.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.750
8 time sine squared of t, dt.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.040
And then you know, sine squared
of t; that looks like a

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.840
tough thing to find the
antiderivative for, but we can

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.150
remember that sine squared of,
really anything-- we could say

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.660
sine squared of u is equal
to 1/2 half times 1

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.290
minus cosine of 2u.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.700
So we can reuse this identity.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.380
I can try the t here; sine
squared of t is equal to 1/2

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.540
times 1 minus cosine of 2t.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.050
Let me rewrite it that way
because that'll make the

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.390
integral a lot easier to solve.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.530
So we get integral from 0 the
pi over 2-- and actually I

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.080
could break up, well I won't
break it up --of 4 cosine of

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:51.550
t plus 8 times this thing.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.350
8 times this thing; this
is the same thing as

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.020
sine squared of t.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:02.250
So 8 times this-- 8 times 1/2
is 4 --4 times 1 minus cosine

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.590
of 2t-- just use a little trig
identity there --and

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.390
all of that dt.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.430
Now this should be reasonably
straight forward to get

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.800
the antiderivative of.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.980
Let's just take it.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:16.500
The antiderivative of this
is antiderivative of cosine

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.610
of t; that's a sine of t.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.150
The derivative of
sine is cosine.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:25.050
So this is going to be 4 sine
of t-- the scalars don't affect

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.470
anything --and then, well let
me just distribute this 4.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:34.640
So this is 4 times 1 which
is 4 minus 4 cosine of 2t.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.630
So the antiderivative of 4 is
4t-- plus 4t --and then the

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.880
antiderivative of minus
4 cosine of u00b5 t?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.970
Let's see it's going
to be sine of 2t.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:58.900
The derivative of sine of
2t is 2 cosine of 2t.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.660
We're going to have to have a
minus sign there, and put a 2

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.420
there, and now it
should work out.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.740
What's the derivative
of minus 2 sine of t?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.240
Take the derivative of
the inside 2 times

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.400
minus 2 is minus 4.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.740
And the derivative of sine
of 2t with respect to

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.280
2t is cosine of 2t.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.830
So there we go; we've figured
out our antiderivative.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.260
Now we evaluate it
from 0 the pi over 2.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.420
And what do we get?

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.210
We get 4 sine-- let me write
this down, for I don't want to

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:34.100
skip too many --sine of pi over
2 plus 4 times pi over 2--

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:42.040
that's just 2 pi minus 2 sine
of 2 times pi over 2 sine of

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:48.620
pie, and then all of that minus
all this evaluated at 0.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.580
That's actually pretty
straightforward because

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.670
sine of 0 is 0.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.490
4 times 0 is 0, and sine of
2 times 0, that's also 0.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.190
So everything with the
0's work out nicely.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.350
And then what do we have here?

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:05.770
Sine of pi over 2-- in my head,
I think sine of 90 degrees;

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.320
same thing --that is 1.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.980
And then sine of pi is
0, that's 180 degrees.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.670
So this whole thing
cancels out.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.440
So we're left with 4 plus 2 pi.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:23.290
So just like that we were able
to figure out the area of this

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.520
first curvy wall here,
and frankly, that's

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.710
the hardest part.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.760
Now let's figure out the
area of this curve.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.220
And actually you're going to
find out that these other

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.830
curves as they go along the
axes are much, much, much

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.760
easier, but we're going to
have to find different

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.480
parametrizations for this.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.390
So if we take this curve
right here, let's do a

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.590
parametrization for that.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.490
Actually, you know what?

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.630
Let me continue this in the
next video because I realize

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.920
I've been running
a little longer.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.110
I'll do the next two walls and
then we'll sum them all up.
