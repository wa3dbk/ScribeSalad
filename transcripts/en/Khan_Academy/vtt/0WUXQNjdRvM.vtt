00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.580
Compute 23 times 44.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.550
And maybe the hardest part of
this problem, or maybe the

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.470
first hard part, is to recognize
that that dot even

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.750
means multiplication.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.700
This could have also been
written as 23 times 44, or

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.880
they could have written it as 23
in parentheses times 44, so

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.130
you just put the
two parentheses

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.600
next to each other.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.840
That also implies
multiplication.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.860
So now that we know we're
multiplying, let's actually do

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.570
the problem.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.290
So we're going to multiply 23--
I'll write it bigger.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.060
We're going to multiply
23 by 44.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.370
I'll write the traditional
multiplication sign there,

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.740
just so that we know
we're multiplying.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.900
When you write it vertically
like this, you very seldom put

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.695
a dot there.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.110
So let's do some
multiplication.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.610
Let's start off multiplying
this 4 in the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.310
ones place times 23.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.790
So you have 3 times 4 is 12.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.530
We can write 2 in the ones
place, but then we want to

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.770
carry the 1, or we want
to regroup that

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.379
1 in the tens place.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.310
So it's 12, so you put
the 1 over here.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.420
And now you have 4 times
2 is 8 plus 1 is 9.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.610
So you can think about
it as 4, this 4 right

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.980
here, times 23 is 92.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.010
That's what we just
solved for.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.540
Now, we want to figure out
what this 4 times 23 is.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.420
Now what we do here is, when you
just do it mechanically,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.800
when you just learn the process,
you stick a 0 here.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.190
But the whole reason why you're
putting a 0 here is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.230
because you're now dealing with
a 4 in the tens place.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.750
If you had another-- I don't
know, a 3 or a 4 or whatever

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.170
digit, and you're dealing with
the hundreds place, you'd put

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.600
more zeroes here, because we're
going to find out 4

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.900
times 23 is 92.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.970
We just figured that out.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.860
If we just multiplied this
4 times 23 again, we

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.320
would get 92 again.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.320
But this 4 is actually a 40, so
it actually should be 920,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840
and that's why we're
putting that 0.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.410
Now you're going to see
it in a second.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.930
So we have-- so let me put this
in a different color.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.410
So this 4 now we're
multiplying.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.740
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.150
Let's put the 2 right here.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.480
It should be in the tens place
because this is really a 40

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.140
times the 3.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.360
Just think about it,
or you could just

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.180
think of the process.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.890
It's the next space
that's free.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.440
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.650
Carry the 1.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.370
This blue 1 is from last time.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.400
You ignore it now.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.450
You don't want to make
that mess it up.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.190
That's when we multiplied
this 4.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.990
So now we have 4 times
2 is 8 plus 1 is 9.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.400
So what we figured out so far is
4 times 23 is 92, and this

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.590
green 4 times 23 is 920, and
that's because this green 4

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.920
actually represents 40.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.640
It's in the tens place.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.560
So when you multiply 44 times
23, it's going to be 4 times

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.940
23, which is 92, plus 40
times 23, which is 920.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.300
I just want to make
sure we understand

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.530
what we're doing here.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770
And so we can take
their sum now.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.060
Let's add them up.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.120
2 plus 0 is 2.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.940
9 plus 2 is 11.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.090
Carry the 1.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.350
1 plus 9 is 10.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.910
Put a comma here, just
so it's easy to

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.460
read, every third digit.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.820
So 23 times 44 is 1,012.
