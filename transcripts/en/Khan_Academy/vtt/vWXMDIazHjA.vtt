00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:04.600
Lets do some example problems here, so we have the perimeter

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.800
of each of the outer triangles is 30. So for example if I took

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.533
The sum of this side, this side, and that side I will get 30 and that is

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.000
true of all these outer triangles, these 5 outer triangles.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.133
They then tell us that the perimeter of FGHIJ

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:28.933
So FGHIJ the perimeter of this pentagon right over here is 50

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:34.333
So if I add up that side plus that side plus that side plus that side, plus that side,

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:39.000
I get 50. And then they say what is the perimeter of the star?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.600
So the perimeter of the star is really the outsides. if you take the bases

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.867
away of each of these triangles. So it is this side, let me do this in a new color actually

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:51.267
So the perimeter of the triangle i will do in orange. It is going to be this

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:57.667
plus that plus that plus that plus that plus that

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:02.333
i think you get the idea plus that plus that plus that plus that

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:10.600
So the perimeter of the of the star so let me call this: perimeter perimeter of the star

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.667
it is going to be equal to the perimeter of the 5 triangles

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:23.267
is equal to perimeter of 5 outer triangles. Just call them 5 triangles like this

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:28.133
minus their basis, right, if i take the perimeter of all of these sides

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:33.067
If i added up the part that should not be part of the perimeter of the star

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:37.000
would be this part,that part, that part,that part, that part and that part.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.333
those are not the part, those are not the part of the perimeter of the star

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.733
so should be the perimeter of the 5 triangles minus the links of their bases

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:52.067
links of their 5 bases. So what is the perimeter of the 5 triangles?

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:57.800
well, the perimeter of each of them is 30, perimeter of 5 of them is going to be 5 times 30

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800
which is 150, now we want to subtract out the links of their 5 bases

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.600
now the links of their 5 bases if we add them up is the exact perimeter of this in inner pentagon

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.667
right over here. So this inner pentagon has a perimeter 50, that is the sum of the 5 bases.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:22.733
So that right over here is 50, so the perimeter of the star is going to be 150 minus 50, or or 100.

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.133
All we need is to get the perimeter of all triangles, subtracted out these bases

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.790
which was the perimeter of the inner pentagon and we are done.

00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:32.395
Now lets do the next problem.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.533
What is the area of this this quadrilateral, something that has 4 sides of ABCD?

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:45.692
And this is a little bit we have not seen a figure quite like this just yet,

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.467
it on the right hand side looks like a rectangle, and on the left hand side looks like a triangle

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:53.000
and this is actually trapezoid, but we can actually as you could imagine

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.800
the way we figure out the area of several triangles splitting it up into pieces we can recognise.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.200
And the most obvious thing to do here is started A and just drop a rock

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.000
drop an altitude right over here, and so this line right over here is going to hit

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.333
at 90 degrees and we could call this point E.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:13.333
And what is interesting here is we can split this up into something we recognize

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:21.000
a rectangle and a right triangle. But you might say how do, how do we figure out what these you know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.800
we have this side and that side, so we can figure out the area

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.867
of this rectangle pretty straight forwardly. But how would we, how would we figure out the area of this

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:35.000
triangle? Well if this side is 6 then that means that this that EC is also going to be 6.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.933
If AB is 6, notice we have a rectangle right over her, opposite side of a rectangle are equal.

00:03:40.933 --> 00:03:49.800
So if AB equals 6, implies that EC is equal to 6, EC is equal to 6, so EC is equal to 6

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:58.267
and if EC is equal to 6 then that tells us that DE is going to be 3.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:02.733
DE is going to be 3, this distance right over here is going to be 3.

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:07.000
And we know that because if this is 6, this has to be something that we add to 6 to get 9,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.667
9 was the length of this entire, of the entire base of this figure right over here.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:18.067
9 was this entire distance so 9 minus 6 gives us 3, and now we have all the information that we need

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:22.933
to figure out the area. The area of this part right over here of this rectangle is

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:30.667
just going to be 6 times 7, so is going to be equal to 42 plus the area of this triangle right over here.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:37.000
Plus the area of this triangle right over here, and that is one half base times height one half.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.933
The base over her is 3, one half times 3 and the height over here is once again going to be 7

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:48.400
this is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so if this is 7, this is also going to be 7

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.267
one half times 3 times 7, so it is going be 42, lets see.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:05:04.600
3 times 7 is 21, 21 divided by 2 is 10.5, 10.5 so this is going to be equal to 52.5

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.267
52.5 is the area of this entire figure.

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:10.533
Lets do one more.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:16.533
So here I have a bizarre looking, a bizarre looking shape, and we need to figure out its perimeter.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:21.333
And it it first seems very daunting because they have only given us this side and this side

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:25.267
and they have only given us this side right over here.

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:29.333
And one thing that we are allowed to assume in this and you don't always have to make

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.467
you can't always make that assumption and I just didn't draw it here

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:34.667
I had time because it would had really crowded out this this diagram.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:39.400
Is it all of the angles in this diagrams are right angles,so i could have drawn a right angle here

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.867
a right angle here, a right angle there, right angle there, but as you can see

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.733
it kind of makes things a little bit, it makes things a little bit messy.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:49.067
But how do we figure out the perimeter if we don't know these little distances,

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:54.600
if we don't know these little distances here. And the secret here is to kind of shift the sides

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.867
because all we want to care about is the sum of the sides of the sides.

00:05:56.867 --> 00:06:02.200
So what I will do is a little exercise in shifting the sides. So this side over here I am going to shift

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.200
it and put it right up there, then this side right over here, this length right over here

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.000
I am going to shift and put it right over there. Then let me keep using different colors, and then this

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.933
side right over here I am going to shift it and put it right up here. Then finally Iam going to have

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:24.267
this side right over here, I can shift it and put it right over there and I think you see

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:28.533
what is going on right now. Now all of these sides combined are going to be the same as this side

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:34.733
kind of building, even you know this thing was not a rectangle,its its perimeter is going to be a little bit interesting.

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:40.000
All we have to think about is this 2 right over here, now lets think about all of these sides that is

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.800
going up and down. So this side i can shift it all the way to the right and go right over here.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.867
Let me make it clear all inside goes all the way to the end, right that it is the exact same all insde.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:56.200
Now this white side I can shift all the way to the right over there, then this green side I can shift

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:04.333
right over there and then I have, and then I can shift, and then i can shift this.

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:08.333
Actually let me not shift that green side yet, let me just leave that green side

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:12.200
so I have not, I have not done anything yet, let me be clear I have not done anything yet with that and

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.533
that I have not shift them over and let me take this side right over here and shift it over.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:21.333
So let me take this entire thing and shift over there and shift it over there.

00:07:21.333 --> 00:07:27.733
So before I count these two pieces right over here and we know that each have length 2

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.333
this 90 degrees angle, so this has link to and this has link to.

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:35.333
Before I count these two pieces, I shifted everything else so I was able to form a rectangle.

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:40.667
So at least counting everything else I have 7 plus 6, so lets see 7 plus 6

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:50.267
all of these combined are also going to be 7, plus 7, and all of these characters combined are all also going to be 6,

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:56.200
plus 6, and then finally I have this 2, right here that I have not counted before, this 2,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:02.933
plus this 2, plus this 2. And then we have our perimeter, so what is this giving us,

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:11.267
7 plus 6 is 13, plus 7 is 20, plus 6 is 26, plus 4 more is equal to 30.

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:12.067
And we are done.
