00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:04.699
As another hint, I will take the same matrix, matrix A

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:10.215
and take its determinant again but I will do it using a different technique, either technique is valid

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:12.132
so here we saying what is the determinant of

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:17.431
the 3X3 Matrix A and we can is we can rewrite first two column

00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:25.264
so first column right over here we could rewrite it as 4 4 -2 and then the second column right over here

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.282
we could rewrite it

00:00:27.282 --> 00:00:31.682
-1 5 0

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:35.049
and we could do is we could take the sum of the products

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:38.099
of the first three top left bottom left diagonal,

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:39.299
let me show you

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:40.881
so the product of that

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:42.299
that

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:43.514
plus

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:45.196
that

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.732
plus

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:48.090
that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.223
trying my best to draw this neatly

00:00:50.223 --> 00:00:51.881
and then from that subtract

00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:54.632
top right to bottom left diagonal

00:00:54.632 --> 00:00:56.131
so from that subtract

00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:57.690
let get a color

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.291
I havent used

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.075
subtract that

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.998
and that

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.964
and that

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.490
sounds really confusing with all the diagonals

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.343
i have drawn

00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:10.876
lets look at the blue ones first

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.149
4 times 5 times 0

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.548
4 times 5 times 0

00:01:15.548 --> 00:01:17.581
plus -1 times 3 times -2

00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:22.132
plus -1 times 3 times -2

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:24.866
let me put these in parenthesis

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:29.708
plus 1 times 4 times 0

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.151
and then we gonna subtract all of these orange

00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:34.950
diagonal, we go from the top right to the bottom left

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.361
so we gonna subtract

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.682
we could do 1 times 5 times -2

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:43.567
1 times 5 times -2 and then we can subtract

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:47.949
subtract 4 times 3 times 0

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:50.564
4 times 3 times 0

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:52.665
and then we can subtract

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.649
-1 times 4 times 0

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.798
-1 times 4 times 0

00:01:56.798 --> 00:01:59.382
and now we just evaluate this over here

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:01.348
4 times 5 times 0

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:03.182
is just 0

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:05.533
-1 times 3 times -2

00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:10.565
is +6 so this is +6

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.082
1 times 4 times 0 is 0 once again

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:16.182
and then we have

00:02:16.182 --> 00:02:18.348
1 times 5 times -2

00:02:18.348 --> 00:02:23.631
is -10 but we have this negative out here so it becomes a +10

00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.181
then 4 times 3 times , well thats just going to be 0.

00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:31.283
and then we have -1 times 4 times 0, which is just 0

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.555
so we are left with +6 + 10

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:38.555
which is equal to +16
