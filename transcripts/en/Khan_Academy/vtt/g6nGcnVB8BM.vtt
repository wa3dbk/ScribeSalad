00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.050
We're asked to solve for x.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.340
So we have the square root of
the entire quantity 5x squared

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.360
minus 8 is equal to 2x.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.830
Now we already have an
expression under a radical

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.860
isolated, so the easiest first
step here is really just to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.500
square both sides of
this equation.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.650
So let's just square both
sides of that equation.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.950
Now the left-hand side, if you
square it, the square root of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.060
5x squared minus 8 squared
is going to be 5x

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.590
squared minus 8.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.960
This is 5x squared minus 8.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.220
And then the right-hand side,
2x squared is the same thing

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.530
as 2 squared times x squared
or 4x squared.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.060
Now we have a quadratic.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.590
Now let's see what we can do
to maybe simplify this a

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.230
little bit more.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.345
Well, we could subtract
4x squared.

00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:51.130
Or actually, even better, let's
subtract 5x squared from

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.480
both sides so that we just have
all our x terms on the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.780
right-hand side.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.000
So let's subtract 5x squared
from both sides.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.600
Subtract 5x squared from both
sides of the equation.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.180
The left-hand side,
this cancels out.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.980
That was the whole point.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.990
We're just left with negative 8
is equal to 4x squared minus

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.915
5x squared, that's negative
1x squared.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:16.740
Or we could just write
negative x

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.040
squared, just like that.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.590
And then we could multiply both
sides of this equation by

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.880
negative 1.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.080
That'll make it into
positive 8.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.800
Or I could divide by negative
1, however you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.330
want to view it.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.900
Negative 1 times that
times negative 1.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.510
So we get positive 8 is
equal to x squared.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.110
And now we could take the square
root of both sides of

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.360
this equation.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.760
So let's take the square
root of both

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.860
sides of this equation.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.200
The principal square root of
both sides of this equation.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.400
And what do we get?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.240
We get, on the right-hand
side, x is equal to the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670
square root of 8.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.270
And 8 can be rewritten
as 2 times 4.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.350
And this can be rewritten as the
square root of 2 times the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.460
square root of 4
is equal to x.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.470
I don't like this green
color so much.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.530
And what's the square root of
4, the principal root of 4?

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.500
It's 2.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.270
So that right there is 2.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.300
So this side becomes 2, this 2,
times the square root of 2.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.850
And that is equal to x.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.970
Now let's verify that this
is the solution to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.350
our original equation.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.260
So let's substitute this in,
first to the left-hand side.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.270
So on the left-hand side, we
have 5 times 2 square roots of

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.860
2 squared minus 8.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.320
And then we're going to have
to take the square root of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.100
that whole thing.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.880
So this is going to be equal
to-- we're just focused on the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.430
left-hand side right now.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.390
This is equal to the square
root of 5 times 2 squared,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.810
which is 4, times the square
root of 2 squared, which is 2.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.190
And then minus 8.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:08.100
And this is 5 times 4
is 20 times 2 is 40.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.760
And then you have 40
minus 8 is 32.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.000
So this is equal to the
square root of 32.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.723
Square root of 32 is the same
thing as the square

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:17.480
root of 16 times 2.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.205
The square root of 16 is 4.

00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:21.680
So this is the same thing as
the square root of 16 times

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.000
the square root of 2.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.670
Or 4 square roots of 2.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.750
So that's what the left hand
simplifies to when we-- and

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.400
remember, the original equation
didn't have these

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.770
squares here, so if you just
look at the green part, the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.590
green part on the left-hand
side just simplified to 4

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.650
roots of 2.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.700
Let's see what 2x
simplifies to.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.570
Our original right-hand
side was just the 2x.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.360
That's parentheses with the
square added later.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.790
So what's 2x?

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.620
2 times 2 roots of 2.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.270
2 square root of 2.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.660
Well that's just 4
square root of 2.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.370
So when x is equal to 2 square
roots of 2, the left-hand side

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.425
equals 4 square roots of 2.

00:03:58.425 --> 00:04:00.380
And remember, the left-hand side
looked like this when we

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.500
started off.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.140
The left-hand side when
we started off

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.930
didn't have that there.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.220
I want to make that clear.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.980
So when you substitute this back
into this left-hand side,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.370
you get 4 square roots of 2.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.510
When you substitute it back into
the original right-hand

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.970
side, you get 4 square
roots of 2.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.450
So it's definitely the right--
I'm trying to write in black.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.149
It's definitely the
right solution.
