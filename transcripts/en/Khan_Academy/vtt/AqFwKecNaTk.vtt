00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.420
A line has a slope of negative
3/4 and goes through the point

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.950
0 comma 8.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.060
What is the equation of this
line in slope-intercept form?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.570
So any line can be represented
in slope-intercept form, is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.680
y is equal to mx plus b,
where this m right over here,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.530
that is of the
slope of the line.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.870
And this b over here, this is
the y-intercept of the line.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.500
Let me draw a quick
line here just so

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.790
that we can visualize
that a little bit.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.580
So that is my y-axis.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.826
And then that is my x-axis.

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:45.270
And let me draw a line.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630
And since our line here
has a negative slope,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.560
I'll draw a downward
sloping line.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.995
So let's say our line
looks something like that.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.890
So hopefully, we're a little
familiar with the slope

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.390
already.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.931
The slope essentially
tells us, look,

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:02.960
start at some point
on the line, and go

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.200
to some other point
of the line, measure

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.846
how much you had to move in the
x direction, that is your run,

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:10.220
and then measure
how much you had

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.440
to move in the y direction,
that is your rise.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.870
And our slope is equal
to rise over run.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.190
And you can see over here,
we'd be downward sloping.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.820
Because if you move in
the positive x direction,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.510
we have to go down.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.052
If our run is positive,
our rise here is negative.

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:29.885
So this would be a
negative over a positive,

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:31.400
it would give you
a negative number.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.870
That makes sense, because
we're downward sloping.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.100
The more we go down
in this situation,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.950
for every step we
move to the right,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.490
the more downward
sloping will be,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.190
the more of a negative
slope we'll have.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.230
So that's slope right over here.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.220
The y-intercept just tells us
where we intercept the y-axis.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.640
So the y-intercept, this
point right over here,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.690
this is where the line
intersects with the y-axis.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.830
This will be the
point 0 comma b.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.310
And this actually just falls
straight out of this equation.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.730
When x is equal to
0-- so let's evaluate

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.920
this equation, when
x is equal to 0.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.200
y will be equal to
m times 0 plus b.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.770
Well, anything times 0 is 0.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.560
So y is equal to 0
plus b, or y will

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.860
be equal to b, when
x is equal to 0.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.660
So this is the point 0 comma b.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.860
Now, they tell us what
the slope of this line is.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.930
They tell us a line has
a slope of negative 3/4.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.112
So we know that our
slope is negative 3/4,

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:43.320
and they tell us that the
line goes through the point

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.900
0 comma 8.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.100
They tell us we go through the--
Let me just, in a new color.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.950
I've already used orange,
let me use this green color.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.010
They tell us what we go
through the point 0 comma 8.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160
Notice, x is 0.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.750
So we're on the y-axis.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.510
When x is 0, we're
on the y-axis.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.720
So this is our y-intercept.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.060
So b, we could say-- we could
do a couple-- our y-intercept is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.630
the point 0 comma 8, or we
could say that b-- Remember,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.240
it's also 0 comma b.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.710
We could say b is equal to 8.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.860
So we know m is equal to
negative 3/4, b is equal to 8,

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.580
so we can write the
equation of this line

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.200
in slope-intercept form.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:39.540
It's y is equal to negative
3/4 times x plus b, plus 8.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.780
And we are done.
