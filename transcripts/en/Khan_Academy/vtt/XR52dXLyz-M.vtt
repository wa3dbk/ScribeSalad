00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:06.133
I wanna talk a little bit more about reflection and specular and diffuse reflection in particular

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:11.067
and to start of, I wanna make a minor correction to the last video, and it's actually a pretty interesting

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.000
correction because in this image right here

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
I talked about a double reflection

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.733
I talked about the light from the sun hitting this pond

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.733
or specularly reflecting off of the surface of this pond

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.889
and than reflecting off of this paddle to get to our eye

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:29.304
and when I said where the light ray was passing

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:36.000
in the last video, I said "it goes from the sun to this point-to this point on the surface

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.733
cause that's where we saw the reflection

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.472
and I said, "than from that point to this point of the paddle

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:42.733
than to our eye that the correction here

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.558
--and someone pointed this out on the message board and it's a very good catch--

00:00:45.558 --> 00:00:50.225
is that this point is where the light if reflecting to our eye

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.709
so that because we see it, we see the sun there

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:57.267
so this light ray right here is coming directly to, directly to

00:00:57.267 --> 00:00:59.629
someone's eye-let me draw someone's eye right there

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.467
or our eye, our eye coming straight out of the page

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:06.400
the light that got reflected here is going to be reflected

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.867
a little bit more shallowly

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.960
so it came from the sun, it came from the sun

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.722
now obviously this won't be exact, but it came from the sun

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:19.134
it probably had a slightly more shallow (uh uh) angle of incidence

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:22.222
or angle between the ray and the surface

00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:24.200
and than it would have gotten to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.214
than it would have gotten to the paddle

00:01:27.214 --> 00:01:31.067
than it would have gotten to the paddle, than it would get to our eye

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:31.742
and I wanna make clear

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:34.227
we don't see the sun at the point that it is reflected

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:38.133
because that light that image of the sun is going to the paddle

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.933
which than goes to our eye

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.800
the point where we see the sun-the reflection of the sun

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.467
that light's going straight into our eye

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.467
it wouldn't have to be reflected by the paddle

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:51.293
so that was an interesting and good catch when you think about the double reflection

00:01:51.293 --> 00:01:53.638
the other thing I wanna talk about

00:01:53.638 --> 00:01:58.724
is when you have both specular and diffuse reflection happening at the same time

00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:00.200
now, we see this all over the place

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.400
any time you see kind of a shiny object

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.600
something that's not a mirror, but it's a shiny object

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000
and we see that right here in the apple, just to make this clear

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.067
so you can see, this-this- white part right here, which we've all seen on a nicely waxed apple

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:16.208
this is, it's like a reflection of the actually light source

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:19.867
while everywhere else, it's just kind of the color of the apple

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:21.270
let's think about what's happening here

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.133
so if I were to draw the surface, if I were to draw the surface of the apple

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.333
let me draw it, let me draw it in a neutral color

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.555
so let's say we have the surface of the apple right over here

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:36.000
we have the surface of the apple right over there

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.800
and than maybe I'll draw it as a slight circle, just so you can appreciate that it's a circular apple

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.533
so the surface of the apple right over here

00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:46.557
you have some light source, so you have some light source

00:02:46.557 --> 00:02:50.551
,so if you have some light source over here

00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.639
and it's, and it's emitting light

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.067
so it is emitting light in some direction, onto the surface of the apple

00:02:59.067 --> 00:03:00.800
and what's happening on the surface of the apple, there's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.067
there's a couple of things that's happening

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:07.667
you're having some of this light is reflecting specularly

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:12.215
or, another way of thinking about it is it's maintaining the image, a little of it, but not all of it

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:14.800
so let me just draw it, so if you're coming in at that incident angle

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.972
you're going to leave at that reflected angle

00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:23.476
and if you came in at this incident angle, you're going to leave at that reflected angle

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:27.000
and if you came in at this incident angle, going to leave at that reflected angle

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.200
and I'm doing dotted lines to show that it's not all of the light that's getting reflected that way

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.267
only some of the light is getting that specular reflection

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:37.000
,but if someone, if this light were to be reaching your eye

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.467
if, let me draw a proper face, so let's say this is someone's face right here that someone's, that's there ear, or there hair

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.133
that's there eyebrows, that's there moustacche

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.803
and, I think you get the general idea

00:03:52.803 --> 00:03:57.215
so this person will see a reasonably good version of the light source

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:00.071
which we see right over here, but what's going on the rest of the apple

00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:03.670
or even over here, so some of the light is reflecting specularly

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.400
it's kind of maintaining the image of the light source

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.269
although that's getting distorted a little bit

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.636
but the rest of the light, the rest of the light

00:04:10.636 --> 00:04:14.800
and let me be clear here- the rest of-some of it is being absorbed

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.067
some of it is being absorbed by the actual surface of the apple

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:23.000
but the rest of it reflecting red light, what we see is actually what the light, apple does not absorb

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.215
what the apple is reflecting, but that red light that mainly red

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.887
I mean it's a bunch of different shades over here

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:35.933
is reflecting diffusely, so that pure light comes in here, some of the pure light get reflected specularly

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:41.635
or kind of purely maintaining the image, but some of it, because the surface of the apple isn't smooth

00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:47.138
is going in all sorts of directions, so of it's going like that, some of it's going like that

00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:50.600
some of it's going like that, and that's happening at every

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.267
at every point on the apple, so that light source

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:57.889
let me draw more of the light source, so rays coming in, and rays coming in from our light source

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.976
but every point of the apple is also having this diffuse reflection

00:05:01.976 --> 00:05:08.400
which is reflecting only the red part of the spectrum, it's absorbing all of the other parts of the spectrum

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.307
and, so what you see is, that point where you're getting the pure specular

00:05:13.307 --> 00:05:16.627
the pure specular reflections, that's the point that looks shiny

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:18.601
where you can kind of see the light source

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:26.733
and from every other point on the apple, where only this guy right here's only getting the diffuse red light

00:05:26.733 --> 00:05:33.090
and that's why, if you move the apple, or actually even better, if you move where you're looking at the apple

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.667
that, point of reflection's gonna look, like if I start looking at it from this direction

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:39.754
I'm gonna get a different point of reflection, cause I'm gonna start seeing the light

00:05:39.754 --> 00:05:44.166
though let's see, let's say that someone's eyeball is right, actually right over here

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:50.273
so that's their eyebrows, that's their eyeball, that's their nose, you get the general idea

00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:54.429
so let's say that this person, let's say that this person, that's their ear

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:56.400
there, I don't wanna get too involved in the drawing

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.667
so let's say that this person is looking at this supper ginormous apple now relatively to him

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.667
he is not gonna see this white spot there

00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:07.270
he is gonna see the white spot on the point where it looks like

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.800
where he's getting the right angle, where, where the rays are coming in

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.733
let me do it in a different color

00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:14.747
so let's say, let's say the light source is above us

00:06:14.747 --> 00:06:16.867
so the light source is coming straight down

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:20.333
is coming straight down to the apple and than if it's the right angle

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:24.933
if the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection relative to the surface of the apple

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:29.200
and we can draw that out, we can draw it perpendicular to the surface of the apple

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.089
this is the angle of incidence, this is the angle of reflection

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.867
so those points, at that point right there he's getting a little bit

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:37.804
and I should draw a dotted line

00:06:37.804 --> 00:06:43.200
he's getting a little bit of the, of the specular reflection, but from every other point

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.933
so for every other point on the apple, so over here, the specular reflection would go that way

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:52.133
not to his eyes, or it would go that way, not to his eyes

00:06:52.133 --> 00:06:55.133
but from those points you also have some of the diffuse reflections

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:59.467
and some of that is going to his eye in terms of red

00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:03.439
the red part of the frequency is getting to his eye from all of these other random directions

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.533
and that's why this guy over here, he would see this, this reflection

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:12.800
he would see this reflection rougly over here, and all of this other part of the apple would look red

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.133
and we, since we're on this side of the apple, we see the reflection point

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:19.600
the light is coming straight down from our light source bouncing right here

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.435
than coming straight out towards our eye

00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:25.067
coming down, and than reflecting, coming straight out towards our eye

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:28.800
it's also coming down on these other points, but those other points are going straight out

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.439
to some place where our eye isn't, instead we're just seeing, we're just seeing the diffuse part

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:35.533
that is actually coming to our eye

00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:39.933
anyway, hopefully you found that a little bit more, um, filled in a couple of the gaps of the last video
