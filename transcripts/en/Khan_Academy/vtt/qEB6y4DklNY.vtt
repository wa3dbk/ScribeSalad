00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.580
Let's, just for the sake of our
imaginations, assume that I'm

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.940
the local loan shark, and you
need a dollar for whatever

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.510
purposes, to feed your
children, or start a

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.590
business or buy a new suit,
whatever it may be.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.940
And you come to me, and you
say Sal, I need a dollar.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.150
I need to borrow it for roughly
a year, and I'm going to get a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.420
great job, or my children will
get a great job, and I'll

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.110
pay you back in a year.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.480
And I say, oh, that sounds very
good, and I will lend you a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.350
dollar for the low price, or
the low interest rate, of

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.750
100% annual interest.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.280
So if you borrow $1 at 100%
interest, if you borrow a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.840
dollar, in a year from now, I
want that dollar back, and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.280
I also want 100% of that.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.150
That's the interest rate.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.800
The interest rate is
essentially what percentage

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.250
of the original
amount you borrowed.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.910
That's called the principal
in finance terms.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.770
That's how much I'm
essentially charging you

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.760
to borrow the money.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.030
So it'll be $1 principal--
that's what you're borrowing,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.460
and of course, you have to pay
that back-- plus 100% interest.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.910
$1.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.190
That's 100%, right?

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.870
100% interest.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.060
And a year from now, you are
going to pay me the principal

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.340
plus the interest, so
you're going to pay me $2.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.040
Well, you're fairly desperate,
so you say, OK, Sal, that's OK.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.930
But seeing that this isn't the
lowest interest rate that

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.090
you've ever seen-- I think the
federal funds rate is at

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.830
something like 2.5 or 3%, so
clearly my 100% is what would

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.720
make any loan shark proud.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.590
You figure, well, I want
to pay this thing off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.510
as soon as possible.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.010
So you say, Sal, what
happens if I have the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.810
money in six months?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.250
Well, I say, OK,
that's reasonable.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.130
For six months, since you're
only borrowing it for half as

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.190
long, I tell you what:
You just have to pay me

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.560
50% after six months.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.820
So this is after one year.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:11.120
After six months, I want you
to pay $1 principal plus 50%

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.110
interest, plus 50 cents, right?

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.170
That's 50%.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.360
And the logic being that if I'm
charging you 100%, I'm charging

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.190
you $1 for you to keep the
money for the whole year, I'm

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.790
only going to charge you
half as much to keep the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.360
money half the year.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.810
And so after six months,
I would expect you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.030
to pay me $1.50.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.300
This is after six months.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.280
And then you say, OK,
Sal, that sounds-- that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.340
makes sense so far.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.100
But let's just say that I want
to-- I intend to pay you back

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.490
in six months, but just in case
I don't have the money in six

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.830
months, will I still just
owe you $2 in a year?

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.860
And I say no, no, no, no.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.100
That I can't deal with because
now I'm giving you the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.730
possibility of paying off
earlier, and if you pay this

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.950
money earlier, then I have to
figure out where I'm going to--

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.240
essentially who I'm going to
take advantage of next.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.290
While if I just lock in my
money with you, I can take

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.870
advantage of you for
an entire year.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.440
So what I say is if you want
to-- what you're going to have

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.900
to do is essentially reborrow
the money after six months

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.650
for another six months.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.790
So instead of me paying you--
instead of me charging you 50

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.970
cents for the next six months,
I'm going to charge you 50%

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.810
for the next six months.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.890
So this is how you can view it.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.400
On day one, you
borrow $1 from me.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.460
In six months, you
pay $1.50, right?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.940
And we decided that 50 percent
was a fair interest rate

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.050
for six months, right?

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.980
So let's say that you really
do need the money for a year.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.490
So we will just charge
you another 50% for

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.730
that next six months.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.523
Now that other 50% is
not going to be on your

00:03:53.523 --> 00:03:54.790
initial principal.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.280
Now, after six months,
you owe me $1.50.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.720
So I'm going to charge you-- so
now this is starting at the

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.250
next period, you'd owe me
$1.50, and now I'm going to

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.340
charge you 50% of that,
so that's 75 cents.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.550
So it's still a 50% interest
rate for the six months, but

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.160
your principal has
increased, right?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.780
Because it was the old
principal plus the old

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.990
interest, and that's how much
you owe me now, and now

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.590
I'm going to charge the
interest rate on that.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.690
And so now that equals
$2.25 over a year.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.730
So you look at that, and you're
like, wow, you know, just to be

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.730
able to essentially have this
option to pay earlier, I'm

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.700
essentially on an annual rate.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.270
My annual rate looks a lot more
like 125% interest, right?

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.730
Because my original principal--
your original principal was $1,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.510
and now you're paying $1.25
in interest, so you're

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.420
paying 125% annual rate.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.800
So that looks pretty bad to
you, but you are, I guess, in a

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.530
tough bind, so you agree to it.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.460
And I explained to you that
this is actually just

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.320
a very common thing.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.720
Even though it looks suspicious
to you, it is called

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.060
compounding interest.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.360
It means that after every
period-- if we say something

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.420
compounds twice a year, after
every six months, we take the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.100
interest off of the new
amount that you owe me.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.200
You could pay me back what you
owe me at that point, or you

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.560
could essentially reborrow it
at the same rate for

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.180
another six months.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.890
So you say, OK, Sal, you're
overwhelming me a little

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.890
bit, but I need the
money so I'll do it.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.600
But once again, you know,
on an annual basis,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.470
125% looks even worse.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.260
You know, 50% over six
months still isn't cheap.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.280
What if I have the
money in a month?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.680
What if I have the money in a
month, where I say, OK, here's

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.750
the deal: same notion.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.350
Instead of charging you 100%
per year, I'm going to charge

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.280
you-- so this is scenario
one, this is scenario two.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400
I'm going to charge
you 1/12 of that.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.740
I'm going to charge you
100% divided by 12,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.470
and what is that?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.310
It's 12 goes into 100 eight
and a half times, right?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.630
Yeah, 8 times 12 is 96,
and then you get another

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.220
half in there, right?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.840
So now I'll say, well, if you
want to pay me on any given

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:18.110
month, I'll just charge
you 8.5% per month.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.660
And once again, though,
it's going to compound.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.280
So let's say you start with $1.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.260
After one month, you're going
to owe me that $1 plus 8.5%.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.540
So after one month,
you're going to owe

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.890
me 1 plus 8.5% of 1.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:41.410
So plus 0.085, which
equals 1.085.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.690
And then after a month,
you're going to owe me

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.990
this plus 8.5% of this.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:07:00.040
So it would be essentially
1.085 squared, and you can do

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.520
the math to figure that out.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.490
And then after three months,
you'll owe me 1.085

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.450
to the third.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:14.650
And after a full year, you'll
actually owe me 1.085 to the

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.390
12th power, and let's
see what that is.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.440
I'm going to use my
little Excel here.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.680
Let's see, if I have
plus 1.085 to the 12th,

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.650
you'll owe me $2.66.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.120
That equals $2.66.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.040
And you say, OK, that's
acceptable, reluctantly,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.850
because this is now what?

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.290
166% effective interest rate.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.550
And just keep in mind, all
I'm doing is I'm compounding

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.910
the interest, right?

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.370
This was $1.085, and I think
that makes sense to you.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.080
And the reason why this is
squared is because this is

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:59.050
going to-- this is just this
principal times 1.085 Another

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.114
way to view it is this is the
same thing as-- I'm going to

00:08:01.114 --> 00:08:02.930
do it in a different color.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:12.390
It's equivalent to this
plus 0.085 times 1.085.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:18.560
So it's 1.085 plus
0.085 times 1.085.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:23.850
So if you think of this is 1
times 1.085 and this is 0.085

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.410
times 1.085, then you can
distribute-- you can take out

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.110
the 1.085, and you
would essentially get

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:36.190
1.085 times 1.085.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.900
And it keeps going.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.630
So now, in this situation.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.450
we are compounding
the interest.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.060
We said it's essentially 100%
interest, but we're dividing

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:49.000
it by 12 per month, but we're
compounding it 12 times.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.265
So, in general, what's
the formula if I want

00:08:51.265 --> 00:08:52.930
to compound it n times?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.770
So how much are you going
to have to pay me at

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.530
the end of a year?

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.490
Well, let's say you want to
compound-- let's say you

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.480
want to pay every day.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.270
You want the ability to pay
every day, and I say that's OK,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:12.430
so each day, per day, I'll
charge you 100%, which was my

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.570
original annual rate, divided
by 365 days in a year, but I'm

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.770
going to compound it every day.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.770
So after every day,
you're going to owe 1.--

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.270
what is this number?

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:36.190
Let's see, that number is 100
divided by 365-- whoops, plus

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:54.620
100 divided by 365,
so that's 0.27%.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.320
After every day, you're
going to owe me this much

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.820
times the previous day.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.580
So after 365 days, you're
going to owe me this

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.760
to the 365th power.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.480
So, in general-- oh, I just
realized I ran out of time

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.530
so I will continue this
in the next video.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.200
See you soon.
