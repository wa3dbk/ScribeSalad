00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.940
The average male drinks 2 liters
of water when active

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.220
outdoors with the standard
deviation of 0.7 liters.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.160
You are planning a full day
nature trip for 50 men and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.780
will bring 110 liters
of water.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.020
What is the probability that
you will run out of water?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.540
So let's think about what's
happening here.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.690
So there's some distribution of
how many liters an average

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.590
man needs when they're
active outdoors.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.660
And let me just draw
an example.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.010
It might look something
like this.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.530
So they're all going to need at
least more than 0 liters,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.740
so this would be 0
liters over here.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.140
The average male, so the mean
of the amount of water a man

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.400
needs when active outdoors
is 2 liters.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.070
So 2 liters would be
right over here.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.990
So the mean is equal
to 2 liters.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.680
It has a standard deviation of
0.7 liters or 0.7 liters.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.420
So the standard deviation--
maybe I'll draw it this way.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.629
So this distribution, once
again, we don't know whether

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.930
it's a normal distribution
or not.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.520
It could just be some type
of crazy distribution.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.870
So maybe some people need
almost close to-- well,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.680
everyone needs a little bit of
water, but maybe some people

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580
need very, very little water.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.400
Then you have a lot of people
who need that, maybe some

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.380
people who need more, and no one
can drink more than maybe

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.060
this is like 4 liters
of water.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.660
So maybe this is the actual
distribution.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.750
And then one standard deviation
is going to be 0.7

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.460
liters away.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.870
So this is 1, 0.7 liters is--
so this would be 1 liter, 2

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.060
liters, 3 liters.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.790
So one standard deviation is
going to be about that far

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340
away from the mean.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.360
If you go above it it'll
be about that far, if

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.215
you go below it.

00:01:43.215 --> 00:01:44.020
So let me draw.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.630
This is the standard
deviation.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.450
That right there is the standard
deviation to the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.040
right, that's the standard
deviation to the left.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
And we know that the standard
deviation is equal to-- I'll

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.110
write the 0 in front,
0.7 liters.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.110
So that's the actual
distribution of how much water

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.620
the average man needs
when active.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.210
Now what's interesting about
this problem, we are planning

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.330
a full day nature trip for
50 men and will bring

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.270
110 liters of water.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.360
What is the probability
that you will run out?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.250
So the probability that
you will run out-- let

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.040
me write this down.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.180
The probability that I will or
that you will run out is equal

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.960
or is the same thing as the
probability that we use more

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:42.200
than 110 liters on our
outdoor nature day,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.270
whatever we're doing.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.170
Which is the same thing as the
probability, if we use more

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.620
than 110 liters, that means that
on average, because we

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.350
had 50 men, so 110 divided
by 50 is what?

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.620
That's 2.-- let me get the
calculator out just so we

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.140
don't make any mistakes here.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.215
So this is going to be,
the calculator out.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.860
So on average, if we have 110
liters that's going to be

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.640
drunk by 50 men, including
ourselves I guess, that means

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.160
that it's the-- so we would
run out if on average more

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.770
than 2.2 liters is
used per man.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.390
So this is the same thing as
the probability of the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.410
average, or maybe we should say
the sample mean-- Or let

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:36.620
me write it this way, that the
average water use per man of

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.870
our 50 men is greater than, or
we could say greater than or

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.190
equal to, greater-- well I'll
say greater than because if

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.530
we're right on the money then we
won't run out of water-- is

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.960
greater than 2.2
liters per man.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.150
So let's think about this.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.110
We are essentially taking 50 men
out of a universal sample.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.540
We got this data, who knows
where we got this data from

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.590
that the average man drinks 2
liters and that the standard

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.500
deviation is this.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.450
Maybe there's some huge study
and this was the best estimate

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.750
of what the population
parameters are.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.310
That this is the mean and this
is the standard deviation.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.660
Now we're sampling 50 men.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.899
And what we need to do is figure
out essentially what is

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.250
the probability that the mean of
the sample, that the sample

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.270
mean, is going to be greater
than 2.2 liters.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.290
And to do that we have to figure
out the distribution of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.270
the sampling mean.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.150
And we know what
that's called.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.390
It's the sampling distribution
of the sample mean.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.960
And we know that that is going
to be a normal distribution.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.480
And we know a few of the
properties of that normal

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.090
distribution.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.390
So this is a distribution
of just all men.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.420
And then if you take samples of,
say, 50 men, so this will

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.820
be-- let me write this down.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:58.860
So down here I'm going to draw
the sampling distribution of

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:08.010
the sample mean when n,
so when our sample

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.110
size is equal to 50.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.980
So this is essentially telling
us the likelihood of the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.750
different means when we are
sampling 50 men from this

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.420
population and taking their
average water use.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.470
So let me draw that.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.190
So let's say that this is the
frequency and then here are

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.740
the different values.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.755
Now the mean value of this, the
mean-- let me write it--

00:05:32.755 --> 00:05:37.290
the mean of the sampling
distribution of the sample

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.330
mean, this x bar-- that's really
just the sample mean

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.280
right over there-- is equal
to, if we were to do this

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.260
millions and millions
of times.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.270
If we were to plot all of the
means when we keep taking

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.180
samples of 50, and we were to
plot them all out, we would

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.060
show that this mean of
distribution is actually going

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.470
to be the mean of our
actual population.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.890
So it's going to be the same
value, I'm going to do it in

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:00.710
that same blue.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.570
It's going to be the
same value as this

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.000
population over here.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.740
So that is going
to be 2 liters.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.940
So we still have-- we're still
centered at 2 liters.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.350
But what's neat about this is
that the sampling distribution

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.450
of the sample mean, so you take
50 people, find their

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.230
mean, plot the frequency.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.650
This is actually going to be a
normal distribution regardless

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.600
of-- this one just has a
well-defined standard

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.140
deviation mean.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.970
It's not normal.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.440
Even though this one isn't
normal, this one over here

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.910
will be, and we've seen it in
multiple videos already.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.950
So this is going to be a
normal distribution.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.780
And the standard deviation--
and we saw this in the last

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.760
video, and hopefully we've got
a little bit of intuition for

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.090
why this is true.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.120
The standard deviation--
actually maybe

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.600
put it a better way.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.730
The variance of the
sample mean is

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.470
going to be the variance.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.580
So remember, it's going to
be-- this is standard

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.450
deviation, so it's going to be
the variance of the population

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.110
divided by n.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.400
And if you wanted the standard
deviation of this distribution

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.260
right here, you just take the
square root of both sides.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.350
If you take the square root of
both sides of that we have the

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.210
standard deviation of the sample
mean is going to be

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.100
equal to the square root of this
side over here, is going

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.490
to be equal to the standard
deviation of the population

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.290
divided by the square
root of n.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.340
And what's this going
to be in our case?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.920
We know what the standard
deviation of

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.890
the population is.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.140
It is 0.7.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.340
And what is n?

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.170
We have 50 men.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.010
So 0.7 over the square
root of 50.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.360
Now let's figure out what that
is with the calculator.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:46.210
So we have 0.7 divided by
the square root of 50.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:53.000
And we have 0.09-- well I'll say
0.098-- well it's pretty

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.370
close the 0.99.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.350
So I'll just write that down.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:03.220
So this is equal to 0.099.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:04.880
That's going to be the standard
deviation of this.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.990
It's going to have a lower
standard deviation.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.780
So the distribution is going
to be normal, it's going to

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.490
look something like this.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.800
So this is 3 liters over
here, this is 1 liter.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.980
The standard deviation is almost
a tenth, so it's going

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.915
to be a much narrower
distribution.

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:27.540
It's going to look something--
I'm trying my best to draw

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.140
it-- it's going to look
something like this.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.299
You get the idea.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:38.940
Where the standard deviation
right now is almost 0.1, so

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.679
it's 0.09, almost a tenth.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.880
So it's going to be something--
one standard

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.650
deviation away is going to
look something like that.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.970
So we have our distribution.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.510
It's a normal distribution.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.090
And now let's go back to our
question that we're asking.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.710
We want to know the probability
that our sample

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.870
will have an average
greater than 2.2.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.610
So this is the distribution of
all of the possible samples.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.110
The means of all of the
possible samples.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.130
Now to be greater than 2.2,
2.2 is going to be right

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.380
around here.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.670
So we essentially are asking we
will run out if our sample

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.880
mean falls into this
bucket over here.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.330
So we essentially need to figure
out what is-- you can

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.240
even view it as what's this area
under this curve there?

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.580
And to figure that out we just
have to figure out how many

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.230
standard deviations above the
mean we are, which is going to

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.300
be our Z-score.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.130
And then we could use a Z-table
to figure out what

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.080
this area right over here is.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:45.080
So we want to know when we're
above 2.2 liters, so 2.2

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.630
liters-- we could even do it
in our head-- 2.2 liters is

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.360
what we care about.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.940
That's right over here.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.095
Our mean is 2, so we are
0.2 above the mean.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.730
And if we want that in terms
of standard deviations, we

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.300
just divide this by the standard
deviation of this

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.710
distribution over here.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.820
And we figured out
what that is.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.970
The standard deviation of this
distribution is 0.099.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.900
So if we take-- and you'll see
a formula where you take this

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.000
value minus the mean and divide
it by the standard

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.986
deviation-- that's
all we're doing.

00:10:23.986 --> 00:10:27.020
We're just figuring how many
standard deviations above the

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.190
mean we are.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.980
So you just take this number
right over here divided by the

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:38.770
standard deviation, so 0.099
or 0.099, and then we get--

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:39.345
let's get our calculator.

00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:41.050
And actually we had the exact
number over here.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.750
So we can just take 0.2-- we
could just take this 0.2

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.970
divided by this value
over here.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.210
On this calculator when I press
second answer it just

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.150
means the last answer.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.480
So I'm taking 0.2 divided
by this value over

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:59.150
there and I get 2.020.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.100
So that means that this value,
or I should write this

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:12.020
probability is the same
probability of being 2.02

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.830
standard deviations-- or maybe
I should write it this way--

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.750
more than-- Let me write
it down here

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.530
where I have more space.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.700
So this all boils down to the
probability of running out of

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:33.380
water is the probability that
the sample mean will be more

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.630
than-- just the 50 that we
happened to select-- remember,

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.300
if we take a bunch of samples
of 50 and plot all of them

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.640
we'll get this whole
distribution.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.850
But the one 50, the group of 50
that we happened to select,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.980
the probability of running out
of water is the same thing as

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.560
the probability of the mean of
those people, will be more

00:11:49.560 --> 00:12:02.400
than 2.020 standard deviations
above the mean of this

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.160
distribution, which they're
actually the same

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.000
distribution.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.960
So what is that going to be?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.390
And here we just have to
look up our Z-table.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.150
Remember, this 2.02 is just
this value right here.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.040
0.2 divided by 0.09.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.860
I just had to pause the video
because there's some type of

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.300
fighter jet outside
or something.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.830
So anyway, hopefully they
won't come back.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.880
But anyway, so we need to figure
out the probability

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.930
that the sample mean will be
more than 2.02 standard

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.380
deviations above the mean.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.870
And to figure that out we go
to a Z-table, and you could

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.020
find this pretty
much anywhere.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.600
Usually it's in any stat book or
on the internet, wherever.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.570
And so essentially we want to
know the probability-- the

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:43.300
Z-table will tell you how much
area is below this value.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.050
So if you go to z of 2.02--
that was the value that we

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.930
were dealing with, right.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:53.320
You have 2.02, it was-- so you
go for the first digit.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.990
We go to 2.0, and it was 2.02.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.910
2.02 is right over there.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:06.150
So we have 2.0, and then in the
next digit you go up here.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.290
So 2.02 is right over there.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:12.960
So this 0.9783-- let me write
it down over here-- this

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.700
0.9783-- I want to
be very careful.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.910
0.9783, that Z-table, that's
not this value over here.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.700
This 0.9783 on the Z-table, that
is giving us this whole

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.240
area over here.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.740
It's giving us the probability
that we are below that value.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.840
That we are less than
2.02 standard

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.230
deviations above the mean.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.180
So it's giving us that
value over here.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.060
So to answer our question, to
answer this probability, we

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.240
just have to subtract this from
1 because these will all

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.090
add up to 1.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.830
So we just take our calculator
back out and we just take 1

00:13:49.830 --> 00:14:00.310
minus 0.9783 is equal
to 0.0217.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.480
So this right here is 0.0217.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:12.520
Or another way you could say it,
it is a 2.17% probability

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.250
that we will run out of water.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.160
And we are done.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.350
Let me make sure I got
that number right.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.010
So that number it was,
yeah, 0.0217, right.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:27.630
So it's a 2.17% chance
we run out of water.
