00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.773
Several videos ago I had a figure that looked something like this, I believe it was a pentagon or a hexagon.

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:07.185
and what we had to do is figure out the sum of the in particular exterior angles of the hexagon so that

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:19.909
this angle equaled A, this angle B, C, D and E. The way that we did it the last time we said, well A

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:25.606
is going to be 180 degrees, minus the interior angle that is supplementary to A, and then we did that

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:30.199
for each of the angles and then we figured out, we were able to algebraically manipulate it, we were

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.374
able to figure out what the sum of the interior angles were, using... dividing it up into triangles and

00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:39.646
then use that to figure out the exterior angle. So it was a bit of an involved process. But I want to show

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:43.965
you in this video that there's actually a pretty simple and elegant way to figure out the sum of these

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:50.105
particular external angles, exterior angles I should say, of this polygon, and it actually works for

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:59.438
any convex polygon (if you're picking these particular exterior angles I should say) and so the way to

00:00:59.438 --> 00:01:08.047
think about it is you can just redraw the angles. So lets just draw each of them, so let me draw this

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:13.196
angle right over here, we'll call it angle A or the measure of this angle's A, either way let me draw

00:01:13.196 --> 00:01:19.352
right over here. So this going to be a congruent angle right over here

00:01:19.352 --> 00:01:24.931
it's going to have a measure of A, now let me draw angle B, angle B, and i going to draw

00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.308
adjacent to angle A, and what you could do is just to think about it

00:01:28.308 --> 00:01:33.914
maybe if we draw a line over here, if we draw a line over here that is parallel to this line

00:01:33.914 --> 00:01:39.970
then the measure over here would also be B,because this is obviously a straight line,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.766
it would be like transversal, this of course a responding angles, so if u want to draw

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:50.636
adjacent angle, the adjacent to A, do it like that, or whatever angle this is the measure of B

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:55.382
and now it is adjacent to A, now let's draw the same thing to C

00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:00.277
We can draw a parallel line to that right over here. And this angle would also be C

00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:05.180
and if we want it to be adjacent to that, we could draw it there, so that angle is C

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:12.773
C would look something like this, like that then we can move on to D, once again

00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:20.512
we do it in different color, you could do D, right over here or you could shift it over here

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:23.237
it'll look like that, or shift over here, it'll look like that

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:27.702
If we just kept thinking of parallel, if all of this line were parallel to each other

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:37.253
So, let's just draw D like this, so this line is going to parallel to that line

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:45.442
Finally, you have E, and again u can draw a line that is parallel to this

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:49.521
right over here and this right over here would be angle E

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:54.194
or you could draw right over here, right over here

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:57.844
And when you see it drawn this way, it's clear that when you add up, the

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:04.379
measure, this angle A,B,C,D and E going all the way around the circle, either way

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.760
it could be going clockwise or it could be counter clockwise but it will going all the way

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.027
around the circle.

00:03:11.027 --> 00:03:23.049
And some of this angle, A+B+C+D+E is just going to be 360 degree

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:30.422
And this is work for any convex polygon, and when I say convex polygon I mean one that's not that dented inwards

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:37.020
Just to be clear what I'm talking about, it would work for any convex polygon that is kind of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.655
I don't want to say regular, regular means it has the same size and angle,

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:48.909
but it is not dented, this is a convex polygon. This right here is a concave polygon

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:56.515
Let me draw this, right this way, so this would be a concave polygon

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:04.252
Let me draw as it having the same number of side, So i just going to dent this two sides

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:11.505
right very here. Is it right? Let me do the same number sides, So i do that, that, that, that

00:04:11.505 --> 00:04:17.178
and then that's the same side over there, Let me do that and then like that.

00:04:17.178 --> 00:04:25.974
This has 1,2,3,4,5,6, sides and this has 1,2,3,4,5,6 sides. This is concave, sorry

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:36.443
this is a convex polygon, this is concave polygon, All you have to remember is kind of cave in words

00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:45.245
And so, what we just did is applied to any exterior angle of any convex polygon. I

00:04:45.245 --> 00:04:57.267
Am a bit confused. This applied to any convex polygon and once again if you take this angle

00:04:57.267 --> 00:05:05.432
and added to this angle and added to this angle, this angle, that angle and that angle and I'm not applying that all

00:05:05.432 --> 00:05:09.435
It's going to be the same and I just drew it in that way I could show you

00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:12.842
that they are different angles, I could say that one green, and that one some other color

00:05:12.842 --> 00:05:17.772
they can all be different but if you shift the angle like this you can see that

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:24.000
they just go round the circle. So, once again, I'll just add up to 360 degrees
