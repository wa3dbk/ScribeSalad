00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
Good morning.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.280
We'll now start.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.860
We're still in the first test,
and we'll now start on Section

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.410
9 on page 423.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.090
So let's start with
the first problem.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.600
Problem number 1.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:31.470
If 5t equals 45, and tk is
equal to 1, what is k?

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.890
Well, 5t equals 45.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.990
This is an easy equation.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.080
You divide both sides by
5, you get t equals 9.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.820
And then you have tk equals 1.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.320
We know what t is equal to.
t is equal to 9, right?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.400
So we get 9k is equal to 1.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.532
Divide both sides by 9, you
get k is equal to 1/9.

00:00:51.532 --> 00:00:53.630
And that is choice B.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.370
That's pretty straightforward.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.520
All right.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.130
Number 2.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.380
I'll switch colors.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.610
It takes 4 complete rotations
of-- it's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.190
early in the morning.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.420
I can't even read properly.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.330
It takes 4 complete turns
of a crank to

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.510
raise a window 2 inches.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.440
So 4 turns raise the
window 2 inches.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.030
At this rate, how many turns
does it take to raise the same

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.990
window 3 and 1/2 inches?

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.360
OK.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.970
So 4 turns, 2 inches.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.750
Just to simplify things, we
could say, well, that's the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:51.740
same thing as 2 turns
per inch.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.990
Right?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.520
2 turns per inch, or you could
even say 1 turn per 1/2 inch.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.870
But let's just say
2 turns per inch.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.400
I just divided the top by 2.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.600
If 4 turns to do 2 inches,
it's going to take 2

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.740
turns to do 1 inch.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.830
And it wants to know, the same
window, 3 and 1/2 inches.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.170
Actually, when I first
read it, I read it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.070
as 3 and 1/2 feet.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.020
So actually, this isn't that.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.904
So we want to go 3
and 1/2 inches.

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:22.950
It's early in the morning.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.200
My brain is still foggy.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.190
We could actually even
ignore this.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.850
So we can just set this
up as a ratio.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.510
4 turns goes 2 inches,
is equal to x

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.440
turns for 3 and 1/2.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.950
And 3 and 1/2, we could write
that as 3.5, or we could write

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.200
that as 7/2.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.670
And then we cross multiply.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.750
So 4 times 7/2 is equal to 2x.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.470
And then this cancels
with this.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.343
We have 14 is equal to 2x.

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:07.440
x is equal to 7 turns.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.140
And that's choice B.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.580
Sorry for leading you in
the wrong direction.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.320
I thought they said 3 and
1/2 feet at first. OK.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.300
Turn the page.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.360
Number 3.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.730
Image here.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.190
I'll switch colors again.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.510
Keeps it interesting for
me, at least. OK.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:45.415
If x/y is equal to 2/3, what
is the value of 3x/2y?

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.245
So we know this, and how do
we get the value of this?

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:56.680
Well, we could just manipulate
this relationship

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.750
algebraically.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.420
So we have 3x/2y on the
left-hand side, and then

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.200
whatever we end up on the
right-hand side is our answer.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.350
So let's see how you do that.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.890
So we start off with x/y
is equal to 2/3.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.720
Well, to get here, let's
multiply both sides by 3.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.110
So if you do a 3 over here,
we have to also multiply

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.709
this side by 3.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.910
And then if we multiply both
sides by 1/2-- because this 2

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.090
in the denominator is
essentially 1/2-- then you end

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.760
up with a 2 here,
and a 2 here.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.040
So now we have 3x and 2y.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.130
And now we have 2
times 3 is 6.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.330
3 times 2 is 6.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.190
That equals 1.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.150
Choice C.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.780
All right.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.250
The next one looks like I
have to do some drawing.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.960
So let me clear this
out a little bit.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.040
Number 4.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.060
In the figure above-- let me
draw the figure above.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.570
Looks complicated, huh?

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:05.010
So I have one line that goes
straight like this.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.620
I have one line that goes
straight up like this.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.400
I have another line that crosses
that line like that.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.310
And then I got a bunch
of points.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.070
Let me draw the points.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.550
It takes more time to draw these
than to maybe do them,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.560
although I haven't done
this, so I don't know.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.470
Maybe it will take time.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.500
N.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.304
This is P.

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:46.650
This is T, and R, S.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.070
Then I have O.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.940
Then I've got the angle.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.230
They're calling this angle y,
calling this y degrees.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.740
They say this angle here
is 20 degrees.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.700
And they say this is
a right angle.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.240
And they say that this angle
right here is x degrees.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.650
All right.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.690
So let's read what they're
saying now.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.350
In the figure above, PS--
so this is PS-- and TR

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.470
intersect at O.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.910
Right.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.180
We drew that.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.295
ON is perpendicular to PS.

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.400
This is my little perpendicular
signal,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.020
looks like an r.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.320
OK.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.070
That's perpendicular.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.690
What is the value
of y minus x?

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.940
Interesting.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.660
So let me ask you a question.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.640
y is the opposite
angle to what?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.980
If you remember from the
geometry, opposite angles are

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.590
equivalent, right?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.430
If I have two lines that
intersect like this, then this

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.630
angle is going to be equal
to this angle.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.850
So we know this is y, so what
angle is opposite y?

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.610
Well, this angle
is opposite y.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.460
This whole thing.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.240
So what is this angle?

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.770
This angle is x degrees plus
this 90 degrees, right?

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.260
It's x plus 90.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.570
That's this whole angle.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.570
I added this part of
it plus this part.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.240
That equals this whole angle,
and it's the same thing as y.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.160
And they draw the stuff to
really confuse you, wrote 20

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.950
degrees here.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.170
None of that really matters.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.280
So y is going to be equal to
this whole angle, and that

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.210
whole angle is going to be equal
to this 90 degrees-- is

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.180
equal to this part plus
this part-- plus x.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.900
Subtract x from both sides,
you get y minus

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.760
x is equal to 90.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.430
That's it.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.930
That was number 4.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.220
That's choice C.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.880
I do all that and the problem
took too little time.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.630
OK.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.020
Image.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.270
Invert.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.340
OK, so here they've
got a schedule.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.800
It's the schedule above,
and hopefully you

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.460
have your book open.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.260
I'm on page 424.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.470
In the schedule above, each
session is to be 1 and 1/2

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.380
hours long.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.790
Each break is to be 1/4 hour
long, and lunch is

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.290
to be 1 hour long.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.770
All right.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.760
Session-- oh, boy.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.290
I should just draw this thing.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:24.540
Maybe it'll run into the-- no,
I didn't want to do that.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.360
This is my chart.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.610
Three columns.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.035
I've got this one, and
I've got this one.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.930
And then I'm going to have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.180
six, seven.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.200
I'm going to run out of space.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.460
Trying to make this too neat.

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.891
I don't know if I ran
out of space or not.

00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:20.190
I'll probably have to continue
this in the next video, but

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.050
I'll just keep drawing until
the time runs out.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.900
In the next video, it'll
be all set up.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:33.760
So this is the event,
begin time, end.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.220
Actually, I'll just continue
this in the next video.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.490
I don't want to waste your
time drawing this.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.260
I'll draw it, and then
we'll start the next

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.220
video on this problem.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.650
See you soon.
