00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:01.355
- [Voiceover] So I've
spent a couple videos

00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.574
laying down the foundation
for what three-dimensional

00:00:03.574 --> 00:00:05.308
curl is trying to represent, and here

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:07.010
I'm going to go ahead and talk about

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.492
how you actually compute it.

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:11.199
Three-d curl is the kind
of thing that you take

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.594
with regards to a
three-dimensional vector field.

00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:15.646
So something that takes in
a three-dimensional point

00:00:15.646 --> 00:00:17.999
as its input, and then
it's going to output

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.794
a three-dimensional vector.

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:24.352
It's common to write the component
functions as P, Q, and R.

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:26.426
Each one of these is a
scale or valued function

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.527
that takes in a three-dimensional point,

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.265
and just outputs a number.

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:31.711
So, it'll be that same three-d point

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.461
with the coordinates x, y, and z.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:40.242
So when you have a three-dimensional
vector field like this,

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:41.657
the image you might have in mind would be

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:44.824
something like this, where every point

00:00:45.817 --> 00:00:49.123
in three-dimensional space
has a vector attached to it.

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:50.671
And you know, when you
actually look at it,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.999
there's quite a lot going
on, but in principle,

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.730
all that's really happening
is that each point in space

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.757
is associated with a vector.

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.140
The point in space is the input

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.662
and the vector is the output.

00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:03.107
You're just gluing them together.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:05.613
Naturally, between the three
dimensions of the input

00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:06.705
and the three dimensions of the output,

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:08.634
we have six dimensions going on,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.915
the picture that you're
looking at becomes quite messy.

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:15.763
So, the question is, how do
you compute this curl value

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:17.417
that I've been talking about.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.806
Curl of your vector value function.

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:23.515
Just as a quick reminder,
what this is supposed to be,

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.648
is you're going to have
some kind of fluid flow

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.732
induced by this vector
field, where you're imagining

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:30.651
air flowing along each vector.

00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:32.241
What you want is a function that tells you

00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.835
at any given point, what is the rotation

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:37.821
induced by that fluid
flow around that point.

00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:39.525
Because rotation is described

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:41.242
with a three-dimensional vector,

00:01:41.242 --> 00:01:43.619
you're expecting this to be vector-valued.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.253
It'll be something that
equals a vector output.

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:49.344
If that doesn't make sense,
if that doesn't quite jive,

00:01:49.344 --> 00:01:51.153
maybe go check out the
video on how to represent

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.798
three-dimensional rotation with a vector.

00:01:53.798 --> 00:01:55.237
So what you have here
is going to be something

00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:57.798
that takes as its input, x, y, and z.

00:01:57.798 --> 00:01:59.489
It takes a three-dimensional point,

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.415
and what it outputs is a
vector describing rotation,

00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:03.764
and there's actually another notation

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:06.854
that's quite, quite helpful
when it comes to computing this.

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.932
You take nabla, that
upside-down triangle we used

00:02:08.932 --> 00:02:11.132
in divergence and
gradient, and you imagine

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:15.955
taking the cross-product
between that and your vector V.

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:17.955
As a reminder, this nabla, you imagine it

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:19.937
as if it's a vector containing

00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:21.858
partial differential operators.

00:02:21.858 --> 00:02:23.605
That's the kind of thing where,
when you say it out loud,

00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:25.187
it sounds kinda fancy, a vector full

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:26.901
of partial differential operators,

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:28.322
but all it really means is

00:02:28.322 --> 00:02:30.702
I'm just going to write
a bunch of symbols.

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:33.144
This partial partial x
is something that wants

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:35.618
to take in a multi-variable function,

00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:39.424
and tell you its partial derivative.

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:41.187
Strictly speaking, this
doesn't really make sense,

00:02:41.187 --> 00:02:42.435
like, hey, how can a vector contain

00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:44.248
these partial differential operators?

00:02:44.248 --> 00:02:46.415
But as a series of symbolic movements,

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:47.783
it's actually quite helpful,

00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:51.000
because when you're multiplying
these guys by a thing,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.597
it's not really multiplication.

00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:53.506
You're really going to be giving it

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.736
some kind of multi-variable
function, like P, Q, or R,

00:02:56.736 --> 00:02:58.702
the component functions
of our vector field,

00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:01.031
and evaluating it.

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.787
So just as a warm-up for how to do this,

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.104
let's see what this looks like in the case

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:06.719
of two dimensions, where
we already know the formula

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.767
for two-dimensional curl.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:11.414
What that would look like,
is you have a smaller,

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:14.392
more two-dimensional,
just partial partial x,

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:17.059
partial partial y, del operator.

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:20.934
You're going to take the
cross-product between that

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.489
and a two-dimensional vector

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.518
that's just the component
functions P and Q.

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:29.417
In this case, P and Q would
be just functions of x and y.

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.150
So I'm kind of overloading notation right,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.410
over here I have a
two-dimensional vector field

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.270
that I'm saying, P and y
are scale or value functions

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.702
with a two-dimensional
input, but over here

00:03:36.702 --> 00:03:39.071
I'm also using P and Q to represent ones

00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:41.001
with a three-dimensional input.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:42.400
So you should think of these as separate,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.295
but it's common to use the same names.

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:45.825
This is going to illustrate

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:48.602
the broader, more complicated point.

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:51.783
When you compute something
like this, the cross-product,

00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:52.969
you typically think of it as taking

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:55.600
these diagonal components
and multiplying them,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.085
so that would be your partial partial x,

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:01.267
"multiplied" with Q, which
really means you're taking

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:04.017
the partial derivative
of Q with respect to x.

00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:08.184
Then you subtract off this
diagonal component here,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.682
oh sorry, this should be a y.

00:04:11.682 --> 00:04:13.802
This should be partial partial y.

00:04:13.802 --> 00:04:14.635
Sorry about that.

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:16.315
You need partial partial y of P,

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:18.021
and that's what you're subtracting off.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:21.555
So partial partial y of P,
just the partial derivative

00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:24.265
of that P function with respect to y.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:25.640
Hopefully this is something you recognize.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.265
This is the two-dimensional curl.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:29.790
It's something we got an intuition for,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.082
I want it to be more than just a formula,

00:04:32.082 --> 00:04:33.366
but hopefully this is kind of reassuring

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:36.899
that when you take that del
operator, that nabla symbol,

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:40.199
and cross-product with the
vector valued function itself,

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.767
it gives you a sense of curl.

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:44.274
Now when we do this in the
three-dimensional case,

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:46.099
we're going to take a
three-dimensional cross-product

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.922
between this three-dimensional
vectorish thing

00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:52.091
and this three-dimensional function.

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.239
If you're not terribly comfortable
with the cross-product,

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:56.225
how to compute it or how to interpret it

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.466
and things like that,

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.336
now would probably be a good
time to go find the videos

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:02.345
that Sal does on this and
build up that intuition

00:05:02.345 --> 00:05:06.199
for what a cross-product actually
is and how to compute it.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.665
Because at this point, I'm
going to assume that you

00:05:08.665 --> 00:05:11.157
know how to compute it
because we're doing it in

00:05:11.157 --> 00:05:14.332
kind of an absurd context of
partial differential operators

00:05:14.332 --> 00:05:17.681
and functions, so it's important
to have that foundation.

00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:19.205
The way you compute a thing like this,

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:21.406
is you construct a determinant.

00:05:21.406 --> 00:05:23.733
I'm going to go down here.

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:26.733
Determinant of a certain 3x3 matrix.

00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:33.424
The top row of that is
all of the unit vectors

00:05:33.424 --> 00:05:35.966
in various directions of
three-dimensional space.

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:39.094
So these I, J, and K guys,
I represents the unit vector

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:43.744
in the x direction, so that
would be I is equal to,

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:47.432
x component is one but then
the other components are zero.

00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:50.059
Then similarly, J and K
represent the unit vectors

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.342
in the y and z direction, and again,

00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:54.200
if that doesn't quite make sense,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.257
why I'm putting them up there
or what we're about to do,

00:05:56.257 --> 00:05:58.625
maybe check out that cross-product video.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:00.460
So we put those in the
top rows as vectors.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.858
This is the trick to
computing the cross-product,

00:06:02.858 --> 00:06:05.173
because again, what does
it mean to put a vector

00:06:05.173 --> 00:06:09.094
inside a matrix, but
it's a notational trick.

00:06:09.094 --> 00:06:10.791
Then we're going to take the first vector

00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.393
that we're doing the cross-product with,

00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:15.700
and put its components in the next row.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.765
What that would look like,
is the next row has a

00:06:18.765 --> 00:06:20.265
partial partial y,

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:25.324
no sorry, God I keep messing up here,

00:06:25.324 --> 00:06:28.181
that's an x, you do whatever
the first component is first,

00:06:28.181 --> 00:06:30.266
and then the second component second,

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:33.925
and the third component, the z, partial z.

00:06:33.925 --> 00:06:36.937
Don't know why I'm making
that little mistake.

00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:39.750
For the last row, you
put in the second vector,

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.917
which is in this case, is vector
value function P, Q, and R.

00:06:44.897 --> 00:06:48.897
P, which is a multi-variable
function, Q, and R.

00:06:50.495 --> 00:06:53.251
First, it's worth stepping
back and looking at this.

00:06:53.251 --> 00:06:55.305
This is kind of an absurd thing.

00:06:55.305 --> 00:06:56.979
Usually when we talk about matrices

00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:58.188
and taking the determinant,

00:06:58.188 --> 00:06:59.605
all of the components are numbers

00:06:59.605 --> 00:07:01.756
because you're multiplying
numbers together.

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:04.025
But here, we've got a
notational trick layered

00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.956
on top of a notational trick,
so that one of the rows

00:07:06.956 --> 00:07:08.705
is vectors, one of the rows

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:10.852
is partial differential operators,

00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:11.805
and then the last one,

00:07:11.805 --> 00:07:14.156
each one of these is a
multi-variable function.

00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:16.609
So it seems like this absurd, convoluted,

00:07:16.609 --> 00:07:19.090
as far away from a matrix
full of numbers thing

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.439
as you can get, but it's actually

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.522
very helpful for computation.

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.974
If you go through the process
of computing this determinant

00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:27.722
and saying, what could that mean,

00:07:27.722 --> 00:07:30.062
the thing that pops out
is going to be the formula

00:07:30.062 --> 00:07:31.698
for three-dimensional curl.

00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:33.910
At the risk of having a
video that runs too long,

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.422
I'll call things and end here,

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:39.589
but continue going through that
operation in the next video.
