00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:08.636
It's estimated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, has 100 to 400 billion stars,

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.029
and when you hear a number like that the obvious question is:

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.944
Are there civilizations on planets that are orbiting any of these stars

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:20.241
and maybe even more interesting question is can we detect any of those civilizations?

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:24.379
Have they gotten to the level of technological progress like us,

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:27.662
that they are emitting electromagnetic waves into space

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:30.287
and other civilization like ours can detect and say,

00:00:30.287 --> 00:00:36.954
"Hey, there is someone else out there watching television or using radio or whatever else they might be doing."

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:39.933
So, what I want to do with this video is not answer that question.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.938
That's a big open question, we don't know the answer.

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:45.508
We don't have anywhere near enough information to definitively answer that question,

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:49.502
but I want to do is come up with a framework for at least thinking about that question,

00:00:49.502 --> 00:00:51.236
a way of actually estimating

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:56.929
how many detectable civilizations there are in just our galaxy,

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.918
and there is a formula, that you may or may not have heard of,

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:02.959
called the Drake Equation.

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:04.379
and what we are going to do is independently

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.000
derive our own version of the Drake Equation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.831
It's going to be slightly different,

00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:11.554
but it is the same thought process

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:14.425
and in the future video, I'm going to maybe reconcile

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.425
what we come up with, with the Drake Equation,

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.338
and just so you know Drake equation is named for Frank Drake,

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.810
who is a Professor at University of California Santa Cruz.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.021
He first, kind of put some structure around this problem,

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:29.790
that's why the formula or the equation has his name,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.364
but the equation is not an equation you can apply

00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:35.523
on a daily basis and get results that you can use to build things,

00:01:35.523 --> 00:01:40.871
but what it's, it's the structures of our thinking around this question of

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:46.041
How many detectable civilizations are there in our galaxy?

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:50.067
And to answer this question, I am going to start little bit differently than Frank Drake did

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:53.498
He starts with the number of new stars that're born each year,

00:01:53.498 --> 00:01:56.282
we will see that our definitions are actually pretty close to each other

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:00.856
what I want to do, is start with the total number of stars,

00:02:00.856 --> 00:02:03.902
So, we are trying to come up with is,

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:07.825
I will call it 'N' and this is number of detectable civilizations,

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:20.256
number of detectable civilizations in the Milky Way, in our galaxy.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:25.867
and once again, there could be civilizations, looking back in the star field right over here

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.179
this star right over here, maybe it has a planet that is in the right place

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.579
that has liquid water and maybe there is intelligent life on that planet,

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.000
but they might not be detectable,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.375
because, they aren't technologically advanced enough that they are using electromagnetic radiation

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.215
or maybe they just figured out some other way to communicate

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:49.768
or maybe they are beyond using electromagnetic radiation, you know, radio waves and all the rest to communicate

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:53.415
so we will never be able to detect them.

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:57.215
We are talking about civilizations like ours that are, to some degree,

00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.605
using technology not too different than our own.

00:03:00.605 --> 00:03:03.698
That's what we mean by 'detectable',

00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:06.021
so let's think about that little bit.

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:11.200
I like to start with just the total number of stars in our solar system.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.667
So let's just start with, I will call it, N*,

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:33.000
so this is the number of stars in our galaxy, and our best guess, I said is this's going to be 100-400 billion stars.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.815
We don't even know how many there are, some of them are undetectable,

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.271
and the center of our galaxy is just a big blur to us

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:40.646
we don't even know what's on the other side of that,

00:03:40.646 --> 00:03:44.267
e can't even see all the stars that are packed into the center,

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:49.200
so this is our best guess, 100-400 billion stars.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.113
Now obviously, there is going to be subset of those stars that even have planets.

00:03:54.113 --> 00:03:56.954
So, let's multiply the times that subset; so lets multiply

00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:59.615
times the frequency of having a planet.

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:04.067
If you are a star, this is the percent chance or the frequency or

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:08.010
of the fraction of these stars that have planets (f sub p)

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:17.485
so, I'll write this way "fractions that have planets",

00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:21.575
So, if this is a hundred billion, let's say I am making a guess here

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:23.138
and we are learning more about this everyday,

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:27.387
there are all these discoveries of 'exoplanets'- planets outside our solar systems,

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:29.098
maybe this is one fourth.

00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:33.102
Then you could say, well that means there are 100 billion times one fourth,

00:04:33.102 --> 00:04:37.148
that means there are 25 billion stars that have planets around them.

00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:40.036
But that's still not enough to go to civilizations.

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:43.646
We also need to think about planets, there could be a planet like Jupiter,

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:49.205
and we don't know how life as we know it can survive on a planet like Jupiter or Neptune or Mercury.

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:52.267
It has to have planets that are good for sustaining life.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:55.938
Preferably have a rocky core, liquid water on the outside,

00:04:55.938 --> 00:04:58.538
that's what we think are the ingredients we need for life,

00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:02.021
maybe we are just not being creative enough, that's what we know as life is being.

00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:12.744
So, let's multiply this times the average number of life sustaining or planets that could sustain life on them.

00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:15.129
So we don't necessarily know that they are going to have life,

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.344
but they seem like they are just the right distance from the star,

00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:23.708
not too hot, not too cold. They have the right amount of gravity, water, all the other stuff,

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:26.762
and we still don't know what this means,

00:05:26.762 --> 00:05:44.662
but this means average number, so given a number of solar systems with planets, what's the average number of planets capable of sustaining life,

00:05:44.662 --> 00:05:46.225
and once again, you don't know this answer.

00:05:46.225 --> 00:05:53.308
maybe it is 0.1, it's probably less than 1.

00:05:53.308 --> 00:05:56.025
Therefore any given solar system that has planets,

00:05:56.025 --> 00:05:59.621
the average number capable of sustaining life maybe its 0.1 maybe it's more than 1, I don't know.

00:05:59.621 --> 00:06:02.667
We don't know the exact answer here, but I will throw an answer in,

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:05.846
I 'll throw out a guess, maybe it is 0.1.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:10.902
And here the fraction that has planets (f sub p), i don't know, i will throw that out as,

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:15.277
and once again I am making up these numbers, we really don't know the right answers, this is one-fourth.

00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:18.185
But if we were to multiply this out we would have

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:25.185
the average number of planets in our solar system that are capable of sustaining life

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:30.067
that are around stars that have planets and these planets are capable of sustaining life.

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:43.533
Now, n sub p will give us the total number of planets in our galaxy capable of sustaining life.

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:48.533
Now, just because you have liquid water and right temperature and all the other rest of the ingredients

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.333
doesn't mean that you will actually have life happening on your planet.

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:58.733
So let's multiply that times the fraction that actually generate life (f sub l)

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:03.267
So f sub p is the fraction that actually have life

00:07:03.267 --> 00:07:04.600
and this is actually a very , we dont know this answer, so this is the fraction

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.867
that have life on them

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:13.800
And this is a really big open question

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.067
maybe if you have the ingredients, maybe every planet has life

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:21.000
maybe it is a frequent thing that's happening in our galaxy and frankly our universe

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.267
or maybe it's a very infrequent thing

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:26.467
maybe it's just the right kind of freak set of circumstances that just have to happen

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:30.267
i will throw out a number, just for the sake of having a number

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.933
maybe it is one out of every ten planets

00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:36.600
that have all the right ingredients for life actually do generate life.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.867
My personal guess is probably higher than that given that

00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:44.400
life seems life seems such a robust and flexible thing we have seen in all sort of weird circumstances.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.333
Actually let me make it higher number than that so let me make it one half (0.5)

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.800
assuming that we have all of the ingredients.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.800
So this should tell us essentially

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.384
how many planets in our galaxy have had life on them at some point

00:08:00.384 --> 00:08:04.600
in those planets' lives.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.200
The life might have come and gone

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.600
maybe destroyed itself through nuclear war.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.800
But this would tell us the number of planets in our galaxy

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.933
that had life at at least one point in their history.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.133
Now we care about civilizations, about intelligent life..

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:33.667
So maybe if the asteroid never hit earth...

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:38.000
the dinosaurs would have never evolved to the point of generating

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.867
radios and tvs and telephones and all the rest..

00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:44.067
and so it is kind of a freak circumstance

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:47.800
that because they were destroyed these gaps in the ecosystem developed

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.792
so we could emerge and and be intelligent and

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:51.018
do all these crazy things

00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:52.410
like make YouTube videos and all the rest.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.623
So, let's multiply this times the fraction

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:56.792
if you get all of this, the fraction

00:08:56.792 --> 00:08:59.908
that actually end up having intelligent life

00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:05.942
and maybe this fraction is,

00:09:05.942 --> 00:09:15.338
to a number of 1/10, then probably

00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:17.008
in the next video I'll calculate it all.

00:09:17.008 --> 00:09:19.227
Now this is very important to realise

00:09:19.227 --> 00:09:22.374
because once again, you could have life

00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:25.637
these are all examples of life right over here

00:09:25.637 --> 00:09:27.797
This is actually life on Earth, on our planet

00:09:27.797 --> 00:09:29.377
even though this looks quite alien

00:09:29.377 --> 00:09:32.236
this is a weeble, kind of looked at from very close-up,

00:09:32.236 --> 00:09:35.226
but there is all sorts of forms of life

00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:37.963
many of which we probably can't even begin to imagine

00:09:37.963 --> 00:09:41.975
but what we care is that if intelligent life

00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:44.158
starts to emerge on the planet

00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:46.526
because only intelligent life has a chance,

00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:49.943
we believe of being able to eventually communicate in ways

00:09:49.943 --> 00:09:53.342
that are detectable by us.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:55.152
Now I said intelligent life, but

00:09:55.152 --> 00:09:57.577
maybe not all intelligent life will eventually

00:09:57.577 --> 00:10:00.704
get to the technological sophistication, where

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:05.719
they will be using radio waves, electro-magnetic radiation to communicate with each other

00:10:05.719 --> 00:10:08.542
maybe we might have stagnated at this stage

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:11.253
if nothing of the right things didn't happen..

00:10:11.253 --> 00:10:15.385
So what we need to do now, is multiply this

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:19.600
so right here, we would have the number of planets

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.376
in our galaxy that have had intelligent life on them at some point in their history

00:10:25.376 --> 00:10:28.943
maybe not at a time that coincides with ours,

00:10:28.943 --> 00:10:34.235
but what we wanna do is bring it down even more to the percentage that get to the point

00:10:34.235 --> 00:10:38.527
that they can develop technology that allows us to detect them.

00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:47.044
So, let me multiply times the fraction that are, I'll put a 'C' here,

00:10:47.044 --> 00:10:49.976
'C' for, maybe they're using communication; 'C' for communications

00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:53.627
that allow us to detect them.

00:10:56.703 --> 00:10:59.405
So this is detectable, the fraction that are detectable.

00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:02.840
Now you might think that we're done, this will give you the Total Number of Civilizations, or life-forms

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:11.125
in our Galaxies or the planets that have life forms that developed detectable technologies at some point

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:19.206
in their history.. Now it would be nice if civilizations be not born and die

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:22.895
but the reality is, they do die. They might destroy themselves or whatever,

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:26.960
and they might exist for only a small period of time for the history of that planet

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.891
or the history of that Solar System.

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:35.659
So in order to make it the number of civilizations that are in existance now

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:39.902
and I'll clarify what "now" means in the next video because really if we are

00:11:39.902 --> 00:11:43.192
detecting something from a star that's 10,000 lightyears away

00:11:43.192 --> 00:11:45.892
our "now" means we are just receiving their signals

00:11:45.892 --> 00:11:50.527
so, they released the signals 10,000 years ago.

00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:54.453
But what I want to do is get to know what is the fraction of these whose signals

00:11:54.453 --> 00:11:57.658
are reaching us right now.

00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:02.688
and here, I'll say what's the average lifespan of a civilization

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:06.342
I'll put that "L", who knows what is, maybe 10,000 years

00:12:06.342 --> 00:12:15.022
so civilization lifespan as going to be that over the life of the star

00:12:15.022 --> 00:12:22.145
So, I'll put a 'T' here, for the average lifespan for the star,

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:24.410
and I could say the average lifespan for the planet,

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.703
or whatever, but we're assuming once our star

00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:29.888
supernovas, you're not going to have a chance for

00:12:29.888 --> 00:12:33.258
life on Earth to develop anymore.

00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:35.542
So, maybe this thing appears ten thousand years

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:39.219
and this down here is maybe 10 billion years.

00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:42.043
and if you were to multilply this out, you should get

00:12:42.043 --> 00:12:46.676
the number of detectable civilizations in our galaxy right now.

00:12:46.676 --> 00:12:49.109
I'll leave you there, and next we'll discuss it a little bit

00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:54.911
more, and reconcile it with the more famous version of Drake's equation,

00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:58.145
and I'll also try and talk about this little piece of bit,

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:00.222
because I think it might be a little confusing, and

00:13:00.222 --> 00:13:03.000
I'll try to diagram that out a little bit more..
