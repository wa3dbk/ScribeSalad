00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:02.071
- [Voiceover] So, let's
sum up where we are so far.

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:04.221
We're looking at this formula

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:07.691
and trying to understand why
it corresponds to curvature.

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.000
Why it tells you how much
a curve actually curves.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.094
And the first thing we did is
we noticed that this numerator

00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.176
corresponds to a certain cross-product.

00:00:16.176 --> 00:00:17.838
The cross-product between
the first derivative

00:00:17.838 --> 00:00:19.958
and the second derivative of the function

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:21.559
parameterizing the curve.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:23.214
And the way we started to understand that

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:26.402
is we say, well, the function
parameterizing the curve

00:00:26.402 --> 00:00:30.069
s of t produces vectors
whose tips trace out

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:32.793
that curve itself.

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.950
And now if you think about
how one tip moves to the next

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.248
the direction that it needs to go

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:40.135
for that tip to move to the next one,

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:41.788
that's what the first
derivative tells you.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:44.191
And when you treat that
in an infinitesimal way

00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:47.282
this is why you get tangent
vectors along the curve

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:49.270
and there's an entire
series of videos on that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.911
for the derivative of a
position vector valued function,

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:53.896
and they explain why the first derivative

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:55.640
of a parametric function,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.023
gives you tangent vectors to that curve,

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:00.111
but if we draw all of
those tangent vectors

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.297
just in their own space,

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:03.503
their own little s prime of t space,

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:05.175
you get all of these vectors,

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:06.653
and we're rooting them at the same point

00:01:06.653 --> 00:01:08.116
to be able to relate them more easily.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.500
The way that you move from
the tip of one of those

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.338
to the next one, is given
by the second derivative,

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:16.739
it kind of plays the same
roll for the first derivative

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.357
as the first derivative plays

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:20.153
for the original parametric function.

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:22.333
And specifically if
you have a circumstance

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.622
where the tangent
vectors are just turning,

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:27.459
the only thing they're doing
is purely turning around,

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.665
which is when your curve
is actually curving,

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.222
this corresponds to a case when the

00:01:32.222 --> 00:01:35.455
second derivative function
is pretty much perpendicular

00:01:35.455 --> 00:01:36.288
as vector.

00:01:36.288 --> 00:01:37.968
The vector it produces is perpendicular

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:39.857
to the first derivative vector.

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:42.089
So, this is loosely why the cross-product

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:43.958
is kind of a good measurement of curving

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:45.884
cause it tells you how
perpendicular these guys are.

00:01:45.884 --> 00:01:47.754
But, there is a bit of a catch.

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:49.872
The original formula for curvature,

00:01:49.872 --> 00:01:52.847
the whole reason we're doing
it with respect to arc length

00:01:52.847 --> 00:01:54.617
and not with respect to the parameter t,

00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:57.277
is that curvature
doesn't really care about

00:01:57.277 --> 00:01:58.844
how you parameterize the function.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.705
If you imagine zipping
along it really quickly,

00:02:00.705 --> 00:02:04.205
so your first derivative
vectors are all super long,

00:02:04.205 --> 00:02:05.246
it shouldn't matter,

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:07.029
compared to crawling
along it like a turtle.

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.667
The curvature should
just always be the same.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:12.239
But, this is a problem
if you think back to

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.278
the cross-product that
we're now looking at,

00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:15.687
where you're taking the
cross-product between

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:18.701
the first derivative and
the second derivative,

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:21.459
because if you were
traveling along this curve

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.873
twice as quickly, what that would mean is

00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.425
your first derivative vector,

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:26.604
so I'll kind of draw it again over here,

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.372
would be twice as long,

00:02:28.372 --> 00:02:30.500
to indicate that your going twice as fast.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.331
And similarly your
second derivative vector,

00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:34.240
to kind of keep up with
that changing rate,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.788
would also be twice as long.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:39.112
And as a result, the
parallelogram that they trace out,

00:02:39.112 --> 00:02:42.851
I should actually, kinda
going off screen here.

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:46.606
The parallelogram that they trace out

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:48.610
would be actually four times as big.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.443
Right?

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:51.822
Because both of the vectors get scaled up.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:54.294
So, the way that we
really want to be thinking

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:57.602
about this is not the tangent
vector due to the derivative,

00:02:57.602 --> 00:02:59.002
but normalizing this.

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:00.130
And this should kind of make sense,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.866
because we are thinking in
terms of unit tangent vectors

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.514
for the curvature as a whole.

00:03:03.514 --> 00:03:06.464
So, if you imagine instead
kind of cutting of the vector

00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:09.308
to make sure that it's got a unit length,

00:03:09.308 --> 00:03:10.586
a length of one.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:11.419
And what that means is,

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.568
you're taking the derivative vector

00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:15.130
and dividing it by it's own magnitude,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.450
by the magnitude of
that derivative vector,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.986
and then similarly we'll want
to scale everything else down,

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:23.722
so you're taking this
and kinda scaling it down

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:25.139
by what you need.

00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:28.686
The resulting parallelogram they trace out

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:31.841
is a more pure measurement of
how perpendicular they are,

00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.478
without caring how long they are.

00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:36.223
And with this guy would
be, by the way then,

00:03:36.223 --> 00:03:37.838
this is the second derivative vector

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:40.291
not normalized with respect to itself,

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:41.566
but we're still dividing,

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:43.297
you know the thing we're diving by

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:44.419
as we scale everything down,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.241
is still just the size of
that first derivative vector.

00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.766
So, this cross-product, if
we take the cross-product

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:53.349
between s prime
normalized, s double prime,

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:58.227
oh no, no, no, sorry,

00:03:58.227 --> 00:03:59.367
s prime itself,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:01.094
and I should be saying
vectors for all of these,

00:04:01.094 --> 00:04:02.090
these are all vectors.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.946
If we take the cross-product between that

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:06.171
and s double prime,

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.223
scaled down by that same
value that's still s prime,

00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:12.813
so it's not normalized, this
is just scaled down by s prime.

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:16.837
This here is a more pure
measurement of how perpendicular

00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:19.210
the second derivative vector is to first.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:20.750
And the reason that we
don't really care about

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.577
the second derivative being normalized is,

00:04:22.577 --> 00:04:23.485
if it was the case,

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:24.318
that you know,

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:25.779
the second derivative
was really, really strong

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.428
and wasn't necessarily a unit vector,

00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:29.436
that's fine that's just telling us that

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.195
the tangent vector turns much more quickly

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:32.947
and the curvature should be higher.

00:04:32.947 --> 00:04:36.730
And in fact, it turns out
that this whole expression is

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.864
the derivative of the
unit tangent vector t,

00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:42.728
that unit tangent vector
that I've talked about a lot,

00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:44.905
with respect to the parameter t.

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:48.421
So, whatever the parameter
of your original function is.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.120
And now, if you think back to the,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.953
I'm not sure if it was the last video

00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:53.075
or the one before that,

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:54.047
but I talked about how,

00:04:54.047 --> 00:04:55.329
when you take,

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.315
when we're looking for this derivative of

00:04:57.315 --> 00:04:59.321
the tangent vector, with
respect to arc length,

00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:01.800
the way that you compute this is to

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.130
first take its derivative
with respect to the parameter,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.535
which is something we can actually do,

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:08.574
cause everything is expressed
in terms of that parameter,

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.907
and then dividing it by the,

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.205
basically, the change in arc length

00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:14.637
with respect to that parameter,

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:17.277
which is the size of that
first derivative function.

00:05:17.277 --> 00:05:19.045
So, if this whole thing is the derivative

00:05:19.045 --> 00:05:21.517
of the tangent vector with respect to t,

00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:23.221
what that means is when we take this,

00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:26.054
and we divide that whole thing by,

00:05:28.937 --> 00:05:30.753
the derivative, by s prime,

00:05:30.753 --> 00:05:32.594
that should give us curvature,

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:34.913
and in fact that's just worth
writing in its own here.

00:05:34.913 --> 00:05:36.466
That's curvature.

00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.657
Curvature is equal to,

00:05:38.657 --> 00:05:40.525
and what I'm going to do
is, I'm going to take,

00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:41.571
since we three different times,

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:44.412
we see the magnitude of s prime here,

00:05:44.412 --> 00:05:45.680
magnitude of s prime here,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.752
magnitude of s prime here.

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:48.905
Since we see that three times,

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:50.221
I'm going to go over here,

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.627
and I'm going to put
that on the denominator

00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:53.293
but cubing it,

00:05:53.293 --> 00:05:55.800
so s prime, that derivative vector,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.591
the magnitude of that
derivative vector cubed.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.552
And then on the top,
we still have s prime,

00:06:00.552 --> 00:06:04.719
that vector s prime cross-product
with s double prime,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.492
that vector.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.216
And this, I mean, you could
think of this as yet another

00:06:09.216 --> 00:06:11.055
formula for curvature,

00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:12.741
I think I've given you
like four at this point.

00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:14.711
Or, you could think of it as
just kind of the same thing,

00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:19.077
and if we look back up
at our original one,

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:20.523
that I was trying to justify.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:23.236
This is just the spelled
out version of it,

00:06:23.236 --> 00:06:25.351
because what is this
bottom component here?

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.739
If we take x prime squared
plus y prime squared,

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:29.493
and if we think of the
square root of that,

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:31.196
so kinda taking it to the one half power,

00:06:31.196 --> 00:06:34.195
that would be the magnitude
of the derivative,

00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:36.812
and I kind of showed that in
some of the previous videos.

00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:38.286
And what we're doing is we're cubing that,

00:06:38.286 --> 00:06:41.142
so that whole formula
that's the very explicit,

00:06:41.142 --> 00:06:42.946
you know, in terms of x and y's,

00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:46.119
what's going on is really
just expressing this idea,

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:48.129
you take the cross-product
between the first derivative

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.149
and the second derivative,

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:51.135
and then because you're normalizing it,

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:53.204
you know normalizing with
respect to the first derivative,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.676
you want to scale down
the second derivative

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:55.890
by that same amount,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.717
just so the parallelogram we're thinking,

00:06:57.717 --> 00:07:00.619
kinda shrinks and everything
stays in proportion.

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:03.005
And then once again we're
dividing about that s prime,

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.452
basically because
curvature is supposed to be

00:07:05.452 --> 00:07:07.364
with respect to s, and
not with respect to t.

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:11.358
So, that's a way of, kinda
getting a correction factor

00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:14.494
for how wrong you're going
to be if you just think

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:15.823
in terms of the parameter
t instead of steps

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:18.089
in terms of the arc length.

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:20.458
So, hopefully this makes
the original formula

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:22.816
a little bit less random, seeming,

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:24.175
you know, in this two dimensional case.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.192
And it also gives another
strong conceptual tool

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:28.985
for understanding yet another
way that you can think about

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:32.783
how much a curve itself actually curves.

00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:35.195
And I think I've probably
done enough videos here going

00:07:35.195 --> 00:07:37.076
through all the different formulas,

00:07:37.076 --> 00:07:38.724
for what curvatures should be.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.725
And in the next one or
two I'll go through some

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:43.783
specific examples, just
to see what it looks like

00:07:43.783 --> 00:07:45.200
to compute that.
