00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.430
I think it's very important to
have as many ways as possible

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.450
to view a certain type of
problem, so I want to introduce

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.410
you to a different way.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
Some people might have taught
this first, but the way I

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.850
taught it in the first integral
video is kind of the way that I

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.100
always think about when
I do the problems.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.330
But sometimes, it's more useful
to think about it the way I'm

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.030
about to show you, and maybe
you won't see the difference,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.530
or maybe you'll say, oh, Sal,
those are just the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.010
exact same thing.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.420
Someone actually emailed me and
told me that I should make it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.360
so I can scroll things, and I
said, oh, that's not

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.810
too hard to do.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.140
So I just did that, and
I scrolled my drawing.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.820
But anyway, let's say we have
a surface in 3 dimensions.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.120
It's a function of x and y.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060
You give me a coordinate down
here, and I'll tell you

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.240
how high the surface
is at that point.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.330
And we want to figure out the
volume under that surface.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.880
So.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.360
We can very easily figure out
the volume of a very small

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.210
column underneath the surface.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.870
So this whole volume is what
we're trying to figure out,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.020
right, between the
dotted lines.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.050
I think you can see it.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.730
You have some experience
visualizing this right now.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.940
So let's say that I have
a little area here.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.550
We could call that da.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.240
Let me see if I can draw this.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.430
Let's say we have a little
area down here, a little

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.780
square in the x-y plane.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.580
And it's, depending on how you
view it, this side of it is dx,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.480
its length is dx, and the
height, you could say,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.700
on that side, is dy.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.390
Right?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.100
Because it's a little small
change in y there, and it's a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.490
little small change in x here.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.060
And its area, the area of
this little square, is

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.800
going to be dx times dy.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.720
And if we wanted to figure out
the volume of the solid between

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.090
this little area and the
surface, we could just multiply

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.940
this area times the function.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.250
Right?

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.210
Because the height at this
point is going to be the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.090
value of the function,
roughly, at this point.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.300
Right?

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.640
This is going to be an
approximation, and then we're

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.450
going to take an infinite sum.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.220
I think you know
where this is going.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.170
But let me do that.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.480
Let me at least draw the little
column that I want to show you.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.690
So that's one end of it, that's
another end of it, that's the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.840
front end of it, that's
the other end of it.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.660
So we have a little figure that
looks something like that.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.180
A little column, right?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.400
It intersects the
top of the surface.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.950
And the volume of this
column, not too difficult.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.420
It's going to be this little
area down here, which is,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.360
we could call that da.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.300
Sometimes written
like that. da.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.565
It's a little area.

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:47.890
And we're going to multiply
that area times the height of

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.280
this column, and that's the
function at that point.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.260
So it's f of x and y.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.970
And of course, we could have
also written it as, this

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.590
da is just dx times
dy, or dy times dx.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920
I'm going to write it in
every different way.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.260
So we could also have
written this as f of

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.510
xy times dx times dy.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.730
And of course, since
multiplication is associative,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.140
I could have also written it as
f of xy times dy dx.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.270
These are all equivalent, and
these all represent the volume

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.010
of this column, that's the
between this little area

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.550
here and the surface.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.980
So now, if we wanted to figure
out the volume of the entire

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.850
surface, we have a couple
of things we could do.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.120
We could add up all of the
volumes in the x-direction,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.230
between the lower x-bound and
the upper x-bound, and then

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.330
we'd have kind of a thin sheet,
although it will already have

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.710
some depth, because we're
not adding up just the x's.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.060
There's also a dy back there.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.870
So we would have a volume of a
figure that would extend from

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.170
the lower x all the way to the
upper x, go back dy,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.210
and come back here.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.390
If we wanted to sum
up all the dx's.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.050
And if we wanted to do that,
which expression would we use?

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.800
Well, we would be summing with
respect to x first, so we could

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.040
use this expression, right?

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.035
And actually, we could
write it here, but it

00:04:21.035 --> 00:04:21.970
just becomes confusing.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.880
If we're summing with respect
to x, but we have the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.110
dy written here first.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.430
It's really not incorrect, but
it just becomes a little

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.740
ambiguous, are we summing
with respect to x or y.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.430
But here, we could say, OK.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.140
If we want to sum up all the
dx's first, let's do that.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.890
We're taking the sum with
respect to x, and let me, I'm

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.270
going to write down the actual,
normally I just write numbers

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.210
here, but I'm going to say,
well, the lower bound here is x

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:51.320
is equal to a, and the upper
bound here is x is equal to b.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.380
And that'll give us the volume
of, you could imagine a

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.330
sheet with depth, right?

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.760
The sheet is going to be
parallel to the x-axis, right?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.060
And then once we have that
sheet, in my video, I think

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.280
that's the newspaper people
trying to sell me something.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.040
Anyway.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.470
So once we have the sheet, I'll
try to draw it here, too, I

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.930
don't want to get this picture
too muddied up, but once we

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.010
have that sheet, then we can
integrate those, we can

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.360
add up the dy's, right?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.480
Because this width right
here is still dy.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.300
We could add up of all the
different dy's, and we

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.390
would have the volume
of the whole figure.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.910
So once we take this sum,
then we could take this sum.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.320
Where y is going from it's
bottom, which we said with c,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.230
from y is equal to c to y's
upper bound, to y

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.070
is equal to d.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.690
Fair enough.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.340
And then, once we evaluate
this whole thing, we have the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.520
volume of this solid, or the
volume under the surface.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.330
Now we could have
gone the other way.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.810
I know this gets a little
bit messy, but I think

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.840
you get what I'm saying.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.185
Let's start with that little
da we had originally.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.520
Instead of going this way,
instead of summing up the dx's

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.910
and getting this sheet, let's
sum up the dy's first, right?

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.570
So we could take, we're summing
in the y-direction first.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.420
We would get a sheet that's
parallel to the y-axis, now.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.770
So the top of the sheet would
look something like that.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.705
So if we're coming the dy's
first, we would take the sum,

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:28.780
we would take the integral with
respect to y, and it would be,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.460
the lower bound would be y is
equal to c, and the upper

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.600
bound is y is equal to d.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.346
And then we would have that
sheet with a little depth, the

00:06:39.346 --> 00:06:44.790
depth is dx, and then we could
take the sum of all of those,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.580
sorry, my throat is dry.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.290
I just had a bunch of almonds
to get power to be able

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.070
to record these videos.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.230
But once I have one of these
sheets, and if I want to sum up

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.180
all of the x's, then I could
take the infinite sum of

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.520
infinitely small columns, or in
this view, sheets, infinitely

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.200
small depths, and the lower
bound is x is equal to a, and

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.100
the upper bound is
x is equal to b.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.660
And once again, I would have
the volume of the figure.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.930
And all I showed you here is
that there's two ways of doing

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.790
the order of integration.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.060
Now, another way of saying
this, if this little original

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.190
square was da, and this is a
shorthand that you'll see all

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.300
the time, especially in
physics textbooks, is that we

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.440
are integrating along
the domain, right?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.770
Because the x-y plane
here is our domain.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.690
So we're going to do a double
integral, a two-dimensional

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.132
integral, we're saying that the
domain here is two-dimensional,

00:07:40.132 --> 00:07:48.110
and we're going to take that
over f of x and y times da.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.240
And the reason why I want to
show you this, is you see this

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.830
in physics books all the time.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.300
I don't think it's a
great thing to do.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.860
Because it is a shorthand, and
maybe it looks simpler, but for

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.920
me, whenever I see something
that I don't know how to

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.180
compute or that's not obvious
for me to know how to compute,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.320
it actually is more confusing.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.260
So I wanted to just show you
that what you see in this

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.080
physics book, when someone
writes this, it's the exact

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.350
same thing as this or this.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.170
The da could either be dx times
dy, or it could either be dy

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.420
times dx, and when they do this
double integral over domain,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.380
that's the same thing is just
adding up all of these squares.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.550
Where we do it here, we're
very ordered about it, right?

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.580
We go in the x-direction, and
then we add all of those up in

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.350
the y-direction, and we
get the entire volume.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.020
Or we could go the
other way around.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.580
When we say that we're just
taking the double integral,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.950
first of all, that tells us
we're doing it in two

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.710
dimensions, over a domain,
that leaves it a little bit

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.790
ambiguous in terms of
how we're going to sum

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.430
up all of the da's.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.990
And they do it intentionally in
physics books, because you

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.750
don't have to do it using
Cartesian coordinates,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.720
using x's and y's.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.940
You can do it in polar
coordinates, you could do it

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.260
a ton of different ways.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.200
But I just wanted to show
you, this is another way to

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.870
having an intuition of the
volume under a surface.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.620
And these are the exact same
things as this type of

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.840
notation that you might
see in a physics book.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.420
Sometimes they won't write
a domain, sometimes they'd

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.250
write over a surface.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.430
And we'll later do
those integrals.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.080
Here the surface is easy, it's
a flat plane, but sometimes

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.380
it'll end up being a curve
or something like that.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.790
But anyway, I'm
almost out of time.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.390
I will see you in
the next video.
