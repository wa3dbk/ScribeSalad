00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.830
A recipe for banana oat muffins
calls for 3/4 of a cup

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.820
of old-fashioned oats.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.740
You are making 1/2
of the recipe.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.230
How much oats should you use?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.550
So if the whole recipe requires
3/4 of a cup and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.630
you're making half of
the recipe, you want

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.520
half of 3/4, right?

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.100
You want half of the number of
old-fashioned oats as the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.330
whole recipe.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.440
So you want 1/2 of 3/4.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.860
So you just multiply 1/2 times
3/4, and this is equal to--

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.550
you multiply the numerators.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.590
1 times 3 is 3.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.960
2 times 4 is 8.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.820
And we're done!

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.885
You need 3/8 of a cup of
old-fashioned oats.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.220
And let's visualize that a
little bit, just so it makes a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.040
little bit more sense.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.560
Let me draw what 3/4 looks like,
or essentially how much

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.400
oats you would need in a normal
situation, or if you're

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.060
doing the whole recipe.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.950
So let me draw.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.270
Let's say this represents a
whole cup, and if we put it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.040
into fourths-- let me divide
it a little bit better.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:23.690
So if we put it into fourths,
3/4 would represent three of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.290
these, so it would represent
one, two, three.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.740
It would represent
that many oats.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.240
Now, you want half
of this, right?

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.110
Because you're going to make
half of the recipe.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.320
So we can just split
this in half.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.700
Let me do this with
a new color.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600
So you would normally use this
orange amount of oats, but

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.270
we're going to do half the
recipe, so you'd want

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.645
half as many oats.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.930
So you would want
this many oats.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.790
Now, let's think about
what that is

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.190
relative to a whole cup.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.520
Well, one way we can do it is
to turn each of these four

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.360
buckets, or these four pieces,
or these four sections of a

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.630
cup into eight sections
of a cup.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's see what happens
when we do that.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
So we're essentially turning
each piece, each fourth, into

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.530
two pieces.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.510
So let's divide each
of them into two.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.340
So this is the first piece.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.810
We're going to divide it into
two right there, so now it is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.250
two pieces.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.300
And then this is the second
piece right here.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.390
We divide it into one piece
and then two pieces.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.980
This is the third piece, so
we divide it into one, two

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.805
pieces, and this is the fourth
piece, or the fourth section,

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:37.950
and we divide it into
two sections.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.490
Now, what is this as a fraction
of the whole?

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.840
Well, we have eight
pieces now, right?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.810
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, because we

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.380
turned each of the four, we
split them again into eight,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.650
so we have 8 as the denominator,
and we took half

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.980
of the 3/4, right?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.430
Remember, 3/4 was in orange.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.170
Let me make this very
clear because this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.110
drawing can get confusing.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.280
This was 3/4 right there.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.090
So that is 3/4.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:19.620
This area in this purple color
is 1/2 of the 3/4.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.020
But let's think about it
in terms of the eights.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.180
How many of these sections
of eight is it?

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.910
Well, you have one section of
eight here, two sections of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.820
eight there, three sections
of eight, so it is 3/8.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.460
So hopefully that makes some
sense or gives you a more

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.260
tangible feel for what
it means when

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.800
you take 1/2 of 3/4.
