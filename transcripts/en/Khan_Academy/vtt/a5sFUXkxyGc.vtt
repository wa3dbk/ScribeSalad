00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.200
So we have a company here.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.900
Let's just say it's
a widget factory

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.530
again or a widget company.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.440
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to actually write

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.170
out its income statement over
a given number of years.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.400
What we did in the first video
on this series is we just did

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.140
one snapshot of the
income statement.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.350
I think it was 2008.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.600
But here we're looking at the
income statement over a bunch

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.910
of years, and in this case, I'm
just assuming that they

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.730
have a very stable revenue base,
that they bring in a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.350
very stable amount of
revenue every year.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.360
Now, their cost of goods, I'm
going to split up this time,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.760
because there's two components
of cost of goods, so I'll just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.020
make a cost of goods category
right here.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.550
COGS, but that just stands for
Cost of Goods Sold, but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.250
sometimes you'll hear someone
say our COGS were this or our

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.170
COGS were that.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.180
Cost of Goods Sold.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.150
So they're the variable costs.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.850
And this video isn't a video
on variable versus fixed

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.460
costs, but you might learn
a little bit about it.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.150
So they're the variable costs,
and that's literally the

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.830
actual costs of making
those widgets.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.370
So if the widgets are made out
stainless steel, it's the cost

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.860
of buying the stainless steel
and maybe the electricity bill

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.140
of melting it and reforming it
or however you have to work

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.910
with stainless steel.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.870
So let's say the variable costs
each of these years--

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.690
and I'm assuming stainless
steel prices

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.810
don't change-- is $100,000.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.280
Minus $100,000 every year.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.760
And actually, let's
just say that also

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.850
includes employee costs.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.330
They have people on hourly wages
that are forming these

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.840
stainless steel widgets, so that
incorporates everything.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.490
And then the fixed costs
will essentially be

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.360
the cost of the factory.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.570
And let's say that they
essentially have to build a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.920
new factory every two years, or
let's say they have to do

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.500
major repairs to the factory
every two years.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.910
So let's say repairs
on factory.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.030
Because that's part of the cost
of building the widgets,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.230
because if you continue to make
widgets at this kind of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.060
$1 million a year pace, your
factory has to be retooled or

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.910
revamped every two years.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.090
So let's put this fixed cost.
So the factory retooling.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.410
And most times, and we'll see
this when you look at an

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.230
actual company's income
statement, they're not going

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.930
to break up the variable and
fixed costs within their cost

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.300
of goods sold like this, because
really, they actually

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.740
want to hide it from a lot
of their competitors.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.730
They don't want their
competitors to have too much

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.170
intelligence on what their
cost structure is like.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.875
It could be used against them
potentially, or maybe they

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.170
don't want their customers
to know.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.370
Anyway, factory tooling.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.330
So the way I just described it,
one way to account for it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.750
is when you do the factory
retooling, you essentially

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.390
just mark it as an expense.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.910
So let's say a factory retooling
costs $500,000.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.430
So let's say it's
minus $500,000.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.960
But they do it every
two years.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.000
So you did it in 2005.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.200
They didn't have to do
it in 2006, then they

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.360
can do it in 2007.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.180
They don't have to
do it in 2008.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.250
Fair enough.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.815
And then we have their
gross profit.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.110
Here it's $1 million
minus $600,000.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:30.030
It's $400,000, then it's
$900,000, then it is $400,000,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.250
then it's $900,000.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.580
And let's say that their
SG&amp;A-- SG&amp;A is Selling,

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.390
General and Administrative
expenses.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.120
I'll leave out marketing
for now.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.370
They're SG&amp;A, let's say it's
another $500,000 every year.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.540
So minus $500,000.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.322
And that never changes.

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:57.260
$500,000 every year.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.060
Minus $500,000.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.980
And so their operating profit,
the amount of pre-tax income,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.880
but you know, we're not
considering financing either,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.470
so this is their operating
profit or their EBIT.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.830
So operating profit.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.519
And this year, it's
minus $100,000.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.210
Here it's also minus $100,000.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.970
But then in these years,
they make money.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.120
It's $400,000 and $400,000.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.170
And then we could
take this down.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.605
Let's say they have no
interest expense.

00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:36.350
They have no interest expense,
because that's not the point

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.460
of this video.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.870
And then their pre-tax profit is
going to be the same thing

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.910
as the operating profit, so
minus $100,000, minus

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.640
$100,000, $400,000--
I'll make the good

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.770
years in green-- $400,000.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.810
And then, let's just say they're
in the Caribbean and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.770
they don't have to pay taxes.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.100
Because that's not the point
of this, but you can apply

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.710
some tax rate to this
and figure out what

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.840
their net income is.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.910
But the point of this is, even
though their business is ultra

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.720
stable, they do the exact same
thing every year, when we look

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.660
at the pre-tax or the operating
income, or if we tax

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.950
it, or even at the net income,
we see a super lumpy business,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.625
because in one year they
lost $100,000.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.280
If you're looking at the
business, you're like, oh,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.160
what a horrible business.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.050
But then the next year they make
$400,000, and then they

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.190
lose $100,000.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.190
And you're like, gee, how
is that possible?

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.680
That you have such a sleepy,
stable business that's just

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.790
making COGS year in year out,
and they have the exact same

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:38.810
amount of revenue?

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.860
How is it possible that their
actual income is so lumpy?

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.510
And I think you know, because
you have this every other year

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.610
factory retooling, where they
have to spend $500,000 to

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.430
essentially rebuild their
factory because of all of the

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.560
wear and tear that happened
over the last two years.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.350
So the question is, is this a
good way to account for it,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.720
where when you have to--
I guess you could

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.880
say-- buy new equipment.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.790
Let's say this $500,000 is to
buy actual new stainless steel

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.720
shaping tools, so is it a good
idea to account for it only in

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.660
the period that you spend it?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.405
Because it's not like you're
only using these tools in this

00:06:18.405 --> 00:06:19.280
period and that period?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.060
You're using these tools
throughout the period.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.080
So the answer is, well, no,
it's not a good idea.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.150
Because the whole purpose of
accounting is to give the

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.760
person reading the income
statement in this case as

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.340
accurate a picture of the actual
state of the business

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.940
as possible.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.660
And this, in my opinion, isn't
an accurate picture, where it

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.410
creates this huge lumpiness and
it creates the impression

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.110
of a volatile business even
though it's a super, super

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.510
stable business.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.190
So what you do, instead of just
saying, oh, I had to buy

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.670
$500,000 worth of equipment in
2005, so I literally put a

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.190
$500,000 expense there, and I
didn't have to do that in

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.040
2006, so I have no expense.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.710
I had to do it in 2007,
so I put the expense.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.990
Instead of doing that, what
you do is-- I'll put the

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.290
balance sheet down here-- so
whatever the balance sheet was

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:14.616
in-- so I'll draw both hand
sides of the balance sheet.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.050
So this is the asset side
of the balance sheet.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.730
And just so you don't get
confused, there's always a

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.570
liability side of the balance
sheet as well.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:40.200
So in 2007, maybe before I spent
the $500,000, right when

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.760
I do it, I probably had $500,000
of cash sitting here.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.750
Let me write that down.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.370
So I have cash.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.950
I'll just put a C there.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.750
Cash, $500,000.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.455
And instead of just using this
an expense, and we'll go in

00:07:53.455 --> 00:07:55.570
the future on kind of how you
account for things in a little

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.370
bit more detail and how you
actually do the debits and

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.880
credits, but a simple way to
think about it, instead of

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.950
using this $500,000 as an
expense, we just transferred

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.850
this $500,000 to buy an asset.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.970
So when you use cash to buy an
asset, and that asset has a

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.330
useful life that's more than
just that period, you're

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.650
essentially capitalizing the
expense or you're essentially

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.210
creating that asset on
the balance sheet.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.190
So instead of this $500,000 just
disappearing expense, you

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.690
say, no, now I have-- let's call
it F for factory tools.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:29.120
I have factory tools worth
$500,000, and then that cash

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.080
will go away.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.039
So your assets will not have
really changed, the absolute

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.059
value of the assets.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.730
You'll have just had $500,000
going from cash

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.760
to new factory tools.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.280
And so this might be at the
beginning of when you do it.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.190
Let's say this is 1/1/2007.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.410
And what you say is, I'm going
to use these factory tools.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.640
They're usable over two years.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.760
So what you do is you depreciate
the tools.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.790
So the way you'd think about
this is instead of having

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.530
factory retooling, you could
say factory tool.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.376
Instead of retooling I'll
call that depreciation.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.460
I don't know if you
can read that.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.180
So it essentially spreads
out the cost of

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.850
that $500,000 a year.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.940
So you say, I had a $500,000
piece of capital equipment,

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.570
and its useful life
is two years.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.100
So I used half of
it in year one.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.200
So instead of putting $500,000
there, the depreciation is

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.010
minus $250,000.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.910
Likewise, in this year, no cash
went out the door, but my

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.070
equipment got a little
bit older, so I used

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.120
half more of it.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.000
So it's $250,000.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.240
And then my equipment
is worthless.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.680
So this is in 1/1/2005.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:10:03.540
I have this tool that's
worth $500,000.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.780
Then on 1/1/2006, I will have
used half of the tool.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:18.650
So now this balance sheet-- I
copied the numbers, too, but

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.530
that's 2006.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.020
I'm going from 2005 to 2006.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.790
So now I will have used
up half of it.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:30.410
So according to the accounting,
this equipment is

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.230
no longer worth $500,000.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.520
It's now worth $250,000.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.870
You know, that actually
might make sense.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.200
Maybe if I were to sell it in
the open market, someone might

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.220
say, you know what?

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.500
I'm only willing to pay
$250,000, because you've

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.890
already used it for a year and
it only has one year of useful

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.650
life left, so it's of $250,000
of value to me.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.240
And then the other $250,000
essentially went to an expense

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.740
called depreciation, which
is right there.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.270
So every year, you're going to
have this asset go down on the

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.730
balance sheets by $250,000.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.290
So here at the beginning
of this year, the

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.250
asset is worth $500,000.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.570
So I'll write that up here.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.020
So this is what the
asset's valued.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.890
I'll do it in this
orange color.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.860
So over here, let's say you did
it right at the beginning

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.130
of the year, the asset's
worth $500,000.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.240
Now, it's worth $250,000.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.530
Now, the asset's worth zero, but
at the beginning of this

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.280
year, you buy a new asset
worth $500,000.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.270
Then it's worth $250,000
again.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.080
And this is just an arguably
long-winded way of saying that

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.370
the way you account for this
is you spread out the cost

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.810
over time, over its useful life,
and this spreading out

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.390
is called the depreciation
of an asset.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.060
And I'm running out of time in
this video, and I'll cover it

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.340
in the next, but you might have
also heard of the word

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.500
"amortization." Amortization
is to spread out a

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.450
non-tangible cost over
a period of time.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.110
So for example, depreciation,
this was factory equipment,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.000
and it gets old as I use it,
so I spread out its cost.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.550
That's what depreciation does.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.910
And it accurately reflects
what's actually happening in

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.110
the business.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.960
It's not like I didn't
have any cost here.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.050
I did have cost. I'm
using an asset up.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.690
So therefore, I put
it down there.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.870
Amortization is the exact same
thing as depreciation, but it

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.860
applies to things that
aren't equipment.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.430
It applies to-- and I'll do it
in the next video-- but let's

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.600
say I had one big expense in
terms of I had to pay a bunch

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.160
of fees to the bank, but the
benefit of those fees are

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.980
going to be over time.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.580
Then I would amortize
those fees.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.930
I'll do that in the
next video.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.760
Anyway, hopefully, you found
this vaguely useful.
