00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670
 

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.890
On February 2, 2010 the U.S.
Treasury estimated the

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.900
national debt at 1.2278 times
10 to the 13th power.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.930
And just to get a sense of
things, 1 times 10 to the

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.330
sixth is a million, 1 times 10
to the ninth is a billion, 1

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.470
times 10 to the 12th
is a trillion.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.450
So we're talking on the
order of magnitude

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.210
of 10 trillion dollars.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.470
So this is about 12
trillion dollars.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.970
Then they tell us that the U.S.
Census Bureau's estimate

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.390
for the U.S. population was
about 3.086 times 10 to the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.100
eighth power.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.875
So this is a little over
300 million people.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.900
So that's an interesting number
right there, it's the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.870
population.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.510
And then they say, using these
estimates calculate the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.400
per-person share of
the national debt.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.840
So essentially, we want to
take the entire debt and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450
divide by the number
of people.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.850
That'll give us the per-person
share of the national debt.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.320
Use scientific notation to make
your calculations and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.630
express your answer in both

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.710
scientific and decimal notation.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.860
Which means just as
a regular number.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.410
Round to four decimal places
while making calculations.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.990
So we want the per-person
debt.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.430
So we want to take the total
debt and divide by

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.050
the number of people.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:26.270
So the total debt is 1.2278
times 10 to the 13th.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.610
And we want to divide that by
the total number of people,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.660
which is 3.086 times
10 to the eighth.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.160
And we could separate this into
two division problems. We

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.070
could say that this is equal
to the division right here,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:56.310
1.2278 divided by 3.086.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.630
And then times 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the eighth.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.280
Now, what's 10 to the 13th
divided by 10 to the eighth?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.530
Let me do it over here.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.380
 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.590
The way I think about it, this
is the exact same thing as 10

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.860
to the 13th times 10 to
the negative eight.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.530
This is an eight right here.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.610
If you have a 10 to the eighth
in the denominator, that's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.870
like multiplying by 10 to
the negative eight.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.660
So you have 13, you the same
base 10, so 10 to the 13th

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.770
times 10 to the negative eight
is going to be 10 to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.390
the 13 minus 8.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.070
Which is 10 to the fifth.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.910
Or another way to think about
it: If you have the base in

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880
the denominator, you subtract
the exponents.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.190
So it's 13 minus 8.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.420
10 to the fifth.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.360
So it's this blue expression
times 10 to the fifth.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.240
And let's get a calculator out
to calculate this right here.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.985
And they say round everything
to four decimal places, so

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:02.550
I'll keep that in mind.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.720
Let me turn my calculator on.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:22.760
1.2278 divided by 3.086
is equal to 0.3979.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.020
Because we want to round
right there.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.005
Let me remember that.

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:30.780
Or let me just put it
on the side so I can

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.020
still look at it.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.810
So this this little
dividing decimals

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.840
problem results in 0.3979.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.510
And of course, times 10 to the
fifth dollars per person.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.640
Once again, you might be tempted
to say, hey this is in

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.590
scientific notation.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.760
I have some number times
a power of ten.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.250
But notice, this number is not
greater than or equal to 1.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.010
Remember, this number, if you
want to be formal about

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.260
scientific notation, has to be
greater than or equal to 1, or

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.770
less than 10.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.020
So what we can do here
is we can multiply.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.580
If we don't want to change the
number, we can multiply this

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.630
number by 10 and divide
this number by 10.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.209
Or another way you can think
about it is, this whole thing

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.180
can be rewritten as
0.3979 times 10

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.110
times 10 to the fourth.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.510
What I did was just now was I
broke up the 10 of the fifth

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.710
into a 10 and a 10
to the fourth.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.120
And I did that because I want
to multiply this by 10 so I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.250
can get a 3 out front
instead of a 0.3.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.370
So let's do that.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.400
So essentially, I took a 10 out
of the 10 to the fifth.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.690
I divided it by 10, I multiplied
this other guy by

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.670
10, not changing the
whole number.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.840
So then this right here will
become 3.979 and then times 10

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.090
to the fourth.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.140
 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.630
So that's how much debt
there is per-person

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.140
in scientific notation.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.460
 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.240
Now, in the problem they also
wanted us to express it in

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.700
decimal notation.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.420
Which is just kind of standard
writing it as a number with

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.080
our standard numeric
decimal system.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.100
So what is 3.979 times
10 to the fourth?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.350
Let's think about it.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.490
 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.830
Well let me just
do it this way.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.670
Let's just move the
decimal space.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.910
If we multiply it by 10, we're
going to get 39.79.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.590
If we multiply it by
10 squared, we're

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.335
going to get 397.9.

00:05:45.335 --> 00:05:47.250
If we multiply it by 10
to the third, we're

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.655
going to get 3,979.

00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:53.020
If we multiply it by 10 to the
fourth, we're going to get one

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.340
more zero right there.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:55.320
So we're essentially
going to move the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.680
decimal four to the right.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.380
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.950
So I could write it like this.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:06.620
This is equal to $39,790.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.000
So if you think about the
national debt per person.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.070
Every man, woman, and child in
the United States essentially

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.860
owes $39,970.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.733
