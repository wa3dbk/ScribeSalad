00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.450
 

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.510
Divide and express as a
simplified rational.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.090
State the domain.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.580
We start off with
this expression.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.760
We actually have one rational
expression divided by another

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.960
rational expression.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.850
And like we've seen multiple
times before, these rational

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.640
expressions aren't defined when
their denominators are

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.920
equal to 0.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.150
So p plus 5 cannot be equal to
0, or if we subtract both

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.070
sides of this-- we can't call
it an equation, but we could

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.070
call it a not-equation-- by
negative 5, if we subtract

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.400
negative 5 from both sides, you
get p cannot be equal to--

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.380
these cancel out-- negative 5.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.010
That's what that tells us.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.130
Over here, we could do the same
exercise 4p plus 20

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.060
also cannot be equal to 0.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.390
If it was, this expression
would be undefined.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.300
Subtract 20 from both sides.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.700
4p cannot be equal
to negative 20.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.330
Divide both sides by 4.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.410
p cannot be equal
to negative 5.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.860
So in both situations, p being
equal to negative 5 would make

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.840
either of these rational
expressions undefined.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:16.700
So the domain here is the set
of all reals such-- or p is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.010
equal to the set of all reals
such that p does not equal

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.870
negative 5, or essentially all
numbers except for negative 5,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.800
all real numbers.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.260
We've stated the domain, so now
let's actually simplify

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.870
this expression.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.160
When you divide by a fraction or
a rational expression, it's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.320
the same thing as multiplying
by the inverse.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.360
Let me just rewrite this
thing over here.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.390
2p plus 6 over p plus 5 divided
by 10 over 4p plus 20

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.050
is the same thing as multiplying
by the reciprocal

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.840
here, multiplying by
4p plus 20 over 10.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.470
I changed the division into a
multiplication and I flipped

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.870
this guy right here.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.530
Now, this is going to be equal
to 2p plus 6 times 4p plus 20

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.350
in the numerator.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.770
I won't skip too many steps.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.419
Let me just write that.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:16.480
2p plus 6 times 4p plus 20 in
the numerator and then p plus

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.070
5 times 10 in the denominator.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.940
Now, in order to see if we can
simplify this, we need to

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.690
completely factor all of the
terms in the numerator and the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.850
denominator.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.590
In the numerator, 2p plus 6, we
can factor out a 2, so the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.750
2p plus 6 we can rewrite
it as 2 times p plus 3.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.240
Then the 4p plus 20, we
can rewrite that.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.870
We can factor out a 4 as--
so 4 times p plus 5.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.030
Then we have our p plus 5 down
there in the denominator.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.630
We have this p plus 5.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.280
We can just write it down
in the denominator.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.230
 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.960
Even 10, we can factor that
further into its prime

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.540
components or into its
prime factorization.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.710
We can factor 10
into 2 times 5.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.610
That's the same thing as 10.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.690
Let's see what we
can simplify.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.690
Of course, this whole time, we
have to add the caveat that p

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.610
cannot equal negative 5.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.540
We have to add this restriction
on the domain in

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.240
order for it to be the same
expression as the one we

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.730
started off with.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.680
Now, what can we cancel out?

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.240
We have a 2 divided by a 2.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.330
Those cancel out.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.550
We have a p plus 5 divided
by a p plus 5.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.800
We know that p plus 5 isn't
going to be equal to 0 because

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.910
of this constraint, so we
can cancel those out.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.050
What are we left with?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.980
In the numerator, we have 4
times p plus 3, and in the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.610
denominator, all we have is that
green 5, and we're done!

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.550
We could right this as 4/5 times
p plus 3, or just the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.720
way we did it right there.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.060
But we don't want to forget
that we have to add the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.260
constraint p cannot be equal
to negative 5, so that this

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.980
thing is mathematically
equivalent to

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.640
this thing right here.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.140
