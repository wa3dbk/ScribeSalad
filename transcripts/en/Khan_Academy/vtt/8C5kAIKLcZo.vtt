00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.830
We're asked how many inches
are in 4 and 1/2 yards?

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.300
Let me write that down.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.110
4 and 1/2 yards.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.501
Now, whenever we're dealing with
fractions and we're going

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.350
to multiply and divide by
fractions, it really

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.400
complicates the issue to
have a mixed number.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.540
So right from the get go, I
want to turn this into an

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.020
improper fraction.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.140
Let me do it over here
in the top right.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.640
4 and 1/2 written
as an improper

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.010
fraction is equal to what?

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.000
We're still going to have
2 as a denominator.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.900
So 2 times 4 is 8.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.680
So 8/2 is the same thing 4.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.140
Let me rewrite this, just
as a bit of review.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.640
4 is the same thing as 8/2.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.070
That's the same thing as 4.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.170
And then you have
that plus 1/2.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.670
That is going to give you 9/2.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.870
The quick way to do it: 2 times
4 is 8, 8 plus 1 is 9.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.070
So 4 and 1/2 is the
same thing as 9/2.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.760
So 4 and 1/2 yards is the same
thing as-- let me write it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.185
over here-- 9/2.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.450
yards.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.160
Now, we want to convert
this into inches.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.990
Just so we can take this in baby
steps, maybe we convert

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.890
this into feet first, and then
once we have it in feet, then

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.850
we can convert it into inches.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.620
So to convert it into feet, we
just have to remember that

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.620
there are 3 feet for
every 1 yard.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.530
So let me write that down.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.330
There are 3 feet per yard.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.810
And if we were to multiply 9/2
yards times 3 feet, this yard

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.900
would be in the numerator.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.670
It'd be divided by this yard,
and they would cancel out, and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.740
we'd just be left with feet.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.810
So we know we have
to multiply by 3.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.220
You can say this is 3 feet for
every 1 yard, if it makes it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.470
simple, or just 3
feet per yard.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.340
Another way to think about it
is however many yards you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.200
have, you're going to have
more feet, right?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.480
There are 3 feet per yard.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.170
So if I have 1 yard, I'm
going to have 3 feet.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.750
If I'm going to have 2 yards,
I'm going to have 6 feet.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.190
So you should always think about
it in your head, OK,,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.539
well, yeah, multiplying by 3.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.009
So that also makes sense.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.360
So if we multiply by 3
right over here the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.760
9 times 3 is 27/2.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.330
Let me write it out.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.760
Let me take it step by step,
not skipping any steps.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:33.290
So this is equal to 9/2
times 3/1 yards.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.590
This yards right here,
I'll do it in orange.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.040
Yards times feet per yards.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.790
The yards cancel out, and you're
left with 9 times 3 is

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:04.210
equal to 27/2 feet.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.890
So we figured out 4 and 1/2
yards is 27/2 feet.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.070
And that makes sense because
we should have

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.370
more feet than yards.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.180
And actually, this should
be three times more, so

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.490
everything makes sense.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.290
27/2 is 3 times 9/2.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.710
So now we have 27/2 feet,
and now we want to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.050
convert this to inches.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.260
And we just have to remember
there are 12 inches per yard.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.260
And we're going to want to
multiply by 12, because

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.300
however many feet we have, we're
going to have 12 times

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.840
as many inches.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.290
If we have 1 foot, we're
going to have 12

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.520
inches, 2 feet, 24 inches.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.440
27/2 feet, we're going to
multiply it by 12 to get the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.720
number of inches.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.300
Since this is going to be times
12, and we'll make sure

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.840
the dimensions work out:
12 inches per foot.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.010
And the feet and the foot, this
is just the plural and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.440
the singular of the same word.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.790
It's the same dimension.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.135
This will cancel out.

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:09.130
So this will be-- if we just
rearrange the multiplication,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.210
view it as everything is getting
multiplied, and when

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.540
you just multiply a bunch of
things, order doesn't matter.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.519
So this is equal to 27/2
times 12 feet.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.540
I'm just swapping the order.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:31.540
Feet times inches divided by
feet, or foot, just the

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.140
singular of the same word.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.720
The feet and the foot cancel
out, they're the same unit.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.710
And you have 27 times 12
divided by 2 inches.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.560
And what we could do here is
that our final answer is going

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:51.660
to be 27 times 12/2 inches.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.770
And before we multiply the 27
times 12 and then divide by 2,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.460
you immediately see, well, I can
just divide 12 by 2, and 2

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.400
by 2, and it makes our
computation simpler.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.200
12 divided by 2 is 6,
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.450
It becomes 27 times 6 inches,
and let's figure

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.860
out what that is.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.050
27 times 6.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.340
7 times 6 is 42.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.770
2 times 6 is 12, plus 4 is 16.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:34.910
This is equal to 162 inches,
which makes sense.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.320
4 and 1/2 yards, that gets us to
this number right here: 27

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.180
divided by 2 is 13
and 1/2 feet.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.440
You multiply that by
12, it makes sense.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.580
You're going to have
a bunch of inches.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.980
162 inches.
