00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.700
A carpenter is using a lathe
to shape the final leg of a

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.830
hand-crafted table.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.790
A lathe is this carpentry tool
that spins things around, and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.480
so it can be used to make things
that are, I guess you

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.330
could say, almost cylindrical
in shape, like a leg for a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.840
table or something like that.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.020
In order for the leg to fit, it
needs to be 150 millimeters

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.390
wide, allowing for a margin of
error of 2.5 millimeters.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.480
So in an ideal world, it'd be
exactly 150 millimeters wide,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.030
but when you manufacture
something, you're not going to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.870
get that exact number, so this
is saying that we can be 2 and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.510
1/2 millimeters above or below
that 150 millimeters.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.910
Now, they want us to write an
absolute value inequality that

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.980
models this relationship, and
then find the range of widths

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.970
that the table leg can be.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.780
So the way to think about this,
let's let w be the width

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.830
of the table leg.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.030
So if we were to take the
difference between w and 150,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.690
what is this?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.540
This is essentially how
much of an error

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.959
did we make, right?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:10.170
If w is going to be larger than
150, let's say it's 151,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.250
then this difference is going
to be 1 millimeter, we were

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.600
over by 1 millimeter.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.760
If w is less than 150, it's
going to be a negative number.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.160
If, say, w was 149, 149 minus
150 is going to be negative 1.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.110
But we just care about
the absolute margin.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.720
We don't care if we're above or
below, the margin of error

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.090
says we can be 2 and
1/2 above or below.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.690
So we just really care about
the absolute value of the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.730
difference between w and 150.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.830
This tells us, how much of
an error did we make?

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.370
And all we care is that error,
that absolute error, has to be

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.950
a less than 2.5 millimeters.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.980
And I'm assuming less than--
they're saying a margin of

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.830
error of 2.5 millimeters--
I guess it could be less

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.850
than or equal to.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.960
We could be exactly 2 and
1/2 millimeters off.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.150
So this is the first part.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.110
We have written an absolute
value inequality that models

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.920
this relationship.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.460
And I really want you
to understand this.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.550
All we're saying is look, this
right here is the difference

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.680
between the actual width
of our leg and 150.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.310
Now we don't care if it's above
or below, we just care

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.430
about the absolute distance
from 150, or the absolute

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.590
value of that difference, so
we took the absolute value.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.030
And that thing, the difference
between w a 150, that absolute

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.190
distance, has to be less
than 2 and 1/2.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.300
Now, we've seen examples
of solving this before.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.200
This means that this thing has
to be either, or it has to be

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.090
both, less than 2 and
1/2 and greater than

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.260
negative 2 and 1/2.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.300
So let me write this down.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:52.570
So this means that w minus 150
has to be less than 2.5 and w

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.450
minus 150 has to be greater than
or equal to negative 2.5.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.150
If the absolute value of
something is less than 2 and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.030
1/2, that means its distance
from 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.490
For something's distance from
0 to be less than 2 and 1/2,

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.750
in the positive direction it has
to be less than 2 and 1/2.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.600
But it also cannot be any more
negative than negative 2 and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.880
1/2, and we saw that in
the last few videos.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.140
So let's solve each of these.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.380
If we add 150 to both sides of
these equations, if you add

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.210
150-- and we can actually do
both of them simultaneously--

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.940
let's add 150 on this side,
too, what do we get?

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.910
What do we get?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.360
The left-hand side of this
equation just becomes a w--

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.480
these cancel out-- is less than
or equal to 150 plus 2.5

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.690
is 152.5, and then we
still have our and.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.360
And on this side of the
equation-- this cancels out--

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.750
we just have a w is greater than
or equal to negative 2.5

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.210
plus 150, that is 147.5.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.270
So the width of our leg has
to be greater than 147.5

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.260
millimeters and less than
152.5 millimeters.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.150
We can write it like this.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:11.220
The width has to be less than or
equal to 152.5 millimeters.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.090
Or it has to be greater than or
equal to, or we could say

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.730
147.5 millimeters is less
than the width.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:20.810
And that's the range.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.770
And this makes complete sense
because we can only be 2 and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.460
1/2 away from 150.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.330
This is saying that the distance
between w and 150 can

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.080
only at most be 2 and 1/2.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.690
And you see, this is 2 and 1/2
less than 150, and this is 2

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.550
and 1/2 more than 150.
