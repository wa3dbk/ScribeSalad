00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.240
Let's learn a little bit
about sequences and series.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.020
So what's a sequence?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.980
Well, a sequence is just a
bunch of numbers in some order.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.630
You know, the most difficult
sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.370
You get the point.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.480
And what's a series?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.550
Well, it's often represented--
it's just a sum of sequences,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.980
a sum of a sequence.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.350
So, for example, the arithmetic
sequence-- sorry the arithmetic

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.920
series is just the sum of
the arithmetic sequence.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.630
So 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus--
we could keep going

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.440
until maybe some number.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.345
This is called the
arithmetic series.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.370
Nothing too fancy here.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.860
But before we move forward,
let's get a notation for how we

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.630
can represent these sums
without necessarily having to

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.430
write out all of the digits or
having to keep doing this dot,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.140
dot, dot, plus notation.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.475
And that notation
is Sigma notation.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.740
That's an upper case Sigma.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.510
And how do you use
Sigma notation?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.490
Well, let's say I wanted
to represent this

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.020
arithmetic series.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.590
So I would say, well,
let's add up a bunch of--

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.940
let's call them k's.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.810
This is an arbitrary variable.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.480
And we'll start at k equals 1.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.240
We'll start at k equals
1, and we'll go to k

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.850
is equal to big N.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.795
And this is the exact same
thing, so we first make k equal

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:32.100
to 1, and then we add it to k
is equal to 2 plus 3, and we go

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.550
all the way until N minus
1 and then plus N.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.770
So this is the Sigma notation
for the arithmetic series.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.110
Before I move on, I think this
is a good time just to like

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.730
learn a little bit more about
the arithmetic series.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.010
We'll actually focus on this
one and the geometric series

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.560
because those are the two
that you'll see most often.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.010
And then once you learn
calculus, I'll show you the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.040
power and Taylor series, which
is exact-- the Taylor series is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.250
a specific version
of a power series.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.690
But let's play around with this
arith-- I keep wanting to say

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.175
arith-MET-ic, but a-RITH-metic,
either way-- series.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.170
So let's call the sum S.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.360
Let's say that this is equal to
the sum from k is equal to 1 to

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.880
N of k, which is equal to, just
like we said, 1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.800
And we'll just keep adding
them, dot, dot, dot, to a bunch

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.200
of numbers, to big N minus
1 plus big N, right?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.140
Fair enough.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.940
Now, bear with me a second.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.430
I'm just going to write that
same exact sum again, but

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.640
I'm just going to write
it in reverse order.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.520
And I think it's intuitive to
you that it doesn't matter what

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.170
order I add up numbers in.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.580
They'll add up to
the same number.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.290
2 plus 1 is the same thing
as 1 plus 2, right?

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.892
So let me write this exact
same sum, but I'll write

00:03:00.892 --> 00:03:01.800
it in reverse order.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.040
So that's the same thing as N
plus N minus 1, plus N minus

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.320
2, plus-- and the pluses
keep going-- plus 2 plus 1.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.190
This is the exact sum, just
in the reverse order.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.960
And I did that for a reason
because now I'm going to add

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.250
both sides of this equation.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430
I'm going to take-- S plus S.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.450
Well, that's just 2S.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.870
And that's going to equal
this sum plus this sum.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.340
I wrote this so that
the sum becomes clean.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.490
And why do I say that?

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.000
Well, let's add up
corresponding terms.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.600
We could have added up any
terms, but-- so since they all

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.345
have to add up, let's just add
the 1 plus the N, then we'll

00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:47.000
add the 2 plus the N minus 1,
then we'll add the 3 plus the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.820
N minus 2, and so forth.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.560
And I think you'll see in a
second, or maybe you already

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.790
realize why I'm doing this.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.490
One plus the N, the 2 plus the
N minus 1, the 3 and the N

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.160
minus 2, all the way to the N
minus 1 and the 2,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.310
the N and the 1.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.830
What's 1 plus N?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.500
Well, that's just
N plus 1, right?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.410
What's 2 plus N minus 1?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.060
Well, that's also
N plus 1, right?

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.670
What's 3 plus N minus 2?

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:17.705
I think you could guess.

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:19.910
It's N minus 1.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.140
And we just keep doing that.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.890
And what's N minus 2 plus 2?

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.600
Sorry, this is a plus.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.780
N plus 1.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.350
And what's N plus 1?

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.310
Well, that's just N
plus 1, of course.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.190
So my question to you
is how many of these

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.020
N plus 1's are there?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.410
Well, there are N
of them, right?

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.550
Each N plus 1 corresponds
to each of these terms,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.530
so there are N of these.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.000
So instead of just adding N
plus 1 N times, we could say

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.580
that this is just
N times N plus 1.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.485
So we have 2 times the sum is
equal to N times N plus 1, and

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:58.310
we could divide both sides by
2, and we get the sum is equal

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.570
to N times N plus 1 over 2.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.800
Now, why is this neat, or
why is this cool at all?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.210
Well, first of all, we found
out a way to sum this

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.330
Sigma notation up.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.670
We got kind of a
well-defined formula.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.350
And what makes this especially
cool is you can use this

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.650
for low-end parlor tricks.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.530
What do I mean by that?

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.760
Well, you can go up to someone
and you can say, well, how

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.490
quickly do you think I can add
up the numbers between 1 and--

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.000
what am I doing-- oh,
between 1 and 100?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.480
And, you know, people will say,
oh, it will take you a little

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.780
time: 1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.720
And you say, well, it takes
me no time at all because

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.630
this is what I can do.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.340
So the sum-- and I just want
to show you that you can use

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.470
different variables from B
equals 1, we're taking the

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.100
variable B, to 100, right?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.720
That's the sum from 1 to 100.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.160
And we figured out
what that formula is.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.230
It's going to be 100
times 101 over 2.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.340
Well, what's 100 times 101?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.250
It's just going to be 101
with two zeroes, right?

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.030
10,100 over 2, and
that equals 5,050.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.730
That's pretty neat.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.400
Instead of having to say 1 plus
2 plus 3 plus blah, blah, blah,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.395
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
plus 98 plus 99 plus 100, this

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:31.590
would take you some time, and
there's a very good chance you

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.860
would make a careless mistake.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.290
We could just plug into this
formula, which we proved and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.680
hopefully you understood,
and say that equals 5,050.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.560
You could do even something
more impressive: the

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.940
sum from 1 to 1,000.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.150
What's the sum from 1 to 1,000?

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.900
Well, our formula, remember,
was N times N plus 1 over 2.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.715
So if N is equal to 1,000,
then what's our sum?

00:06:53.715 --> 00:07:02.225
It's 1,000 times 1,001 over 2,
which is equal to-- well, we'll

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:09.290
just add three zeroes to
this: 1,001, one, two, three.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.390
Sorry, I think that was
my first burp ever on

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.030
one of these videos.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.300
I should re-record it, but
I'm going to move forward.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.280
That kind of disconcerted
me a little bit.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.620
I'd eaten too much.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.820
Anyway, divided by 2,
and what is that?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.810
Let's see, it'll be 500--
let's see, this is a million.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.830
Half of a million is 500,000.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.510
500,500.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.190
And that would have taken
you forever to do manually.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.810
But based on this formula we
just got, you know how to

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.450
do it very, very quickly.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.620
So that's the
arithmetic series.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.620
But let's do another one.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.520
This is another typical
series that you might see.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.910
Actually, this one you'll see a
lot in your life, especially if

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:03.730
you go into finance or really a
whole series of scientific--

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.890
this shows up a lot, and this
is called the geometric series.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.530
And the geometric series is--
essentially you take x.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.440
And I'll do it generally where
I just take a variable x,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.880
and I say-- well, no, no.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.740
Let me just not take an x.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.020
Let me just take some number.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:29.300
So let's say some number a to
the k from-- I don't know.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.940
Let's say from k is equal
to 0 to k is equal to N.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:34.660
What does that mean?

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:40.950
Well, that means a to the 0,
right, k is 0, plus a 1 plus a

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.780
squared plus a to the third
plus-- and you could keep

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:53.570
going-- plus a to the N minus
1 plus a to the N minus 2.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.560
This is called the
geometric series.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.210
And it might not be obvious to
you, but this type of growth,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.460
where you keep increasing the
exponent, this is called

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.392
geometric growth.

00:09:02.392 --> 00:09:04.360
So how do you take
the sum of this?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.300
Well, let's see if we can do a
similar trick, although this

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.010
trick will involve
one more step.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:13.640
So let's call the sum S.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:23.060
Let's call it the sum from k
equals 0 to N, a to the k.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.950
And that, of course, is
equal to what I just wrote.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.570
I probably didn't have
to do it like this.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.310
a squared plus bup, bup, bup,
bup, plus a to the N minus

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.250
1, plus a to the N minus 2.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:42.040
Now let's define another sum,
and I'm going to call that aS.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.120
Actually, I'm about to run out
of time, so I'll continue

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.430
this in the next video.
