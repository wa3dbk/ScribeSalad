00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:04.427
Theres been a lot of talk about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)

00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:09.537
often referred to as "ObamaCare"; usually by those that are not a big fan of it.

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:13.825
And my goal here is to not take any political sides, and hopefully give

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:16.874
an overview of what all of the debate is about and what this 'Affordable Care Act' is all about.

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:24.257
and I'm going to start with the most controversial part, and this is the 'Individual Mandate'

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:30.931
And this is the idea that you either have to get insurance, or pay: a penalty; or a fee; or a tax.

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:35.854
-Penalty- Which is now being referred to as a tax by many folks.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:43.594
And the idea here is that there are obviously many folks who are uninsured right now,

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:48.253
and when they get sick especially when they get very sick they still get healthcare.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:54.430
In particular they will go to the Emergency Room. They will go to the E.R., and that is

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.180
quite posiibly the most expensive part of the healthcare system to interface with.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.731
So there's kind of a moral argument here, that-

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:09.226
1) These people are getting sicker than they need to get if they had insurance. e.g. getting preventative care and not getting that sick.

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:14.134
Then there's a financial or, I guess you could say, a fairness argument: that these people are getting sick,

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:20.555
going to the E.R., and they have to be given care at that E.R. The Hospitals bear those costs, and then

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.672
eventually recoup those costs by charging more for all sorts of other services.

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:30.215
[These costs] go back to the people who are paying for the healthcare.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:36.686
So, if you have an Individual Mandate it will clear things up a little bit. People will have to

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:43.328
essentially pay for the healthcare they are already getting. Now, the argument against the

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:49.766
'Individual Mandate' is that this is the Government putting into law that people *have to buy something*.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:56.850
In particular, that they have to buy health insurance. Now, the counterargument that many people make is that there

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.304
is something similar going on with car insurance. If you want to drive in most states, you have to buy some type of

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:08.173
car insurance or at least show that you have financial abilities to pay any liabilities you might have if you get into an accident.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:18.183
Now the 'Counter-Counter-Counter-Argument' to that is that, driving is something that someone chooses to do.

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:24.314
That you do not have to drive, while in the case of health insurance, this is something that every person in

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:30.814
the country is being forced to [purchase]. 
I'll leave it to you to decide where you sit on that,

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:32.824
and what balances what other issue.

00:02:32.824 --> 00:02:37.780
Now, obviously, if you're going to decide whether you want insurance, or whether you are going

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.888
to pay a penalty/tax, you have to figure out how high that penalty is going to be on you.

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:48.183
Or if you want to figure out if this is a fair situation. You have to think about high that penalty is going to be.

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:53.571
And the current provisions say that by 2016, which is when the full penalties take effect,

00:02:53.571 --> 00:03:04.094
you are going to have to pay the maximum of either 2.5% of your income, or $695 for an individual,

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:10.521
or $2085 for a family. 
And there are exceptions, and this whole

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:16.401
individual mandate won't apply to you if having/getting insurance will cost you more than 8% of your total income.

00:03:16.401 --> 00:03:23.492
or if you belong to a religion that does not participate in the healthcare system, then it doesn't apply.

00:03:23.492 --> 00:03:31.571
So you will never have to pay more than 8% [of your total income] to get an insurance policy.

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:39.824
But these are the general penalties; If you made $100,000 and chose not to get the insurance,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:48.229
you would pay $2,500 (2.5% of income, and is greater than the minimum penalties).

00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:56.421
If your [family] makes $50,000, then the 2.5% [$1250] would be less than the [family] minimum, so you would pay $2085.

00:03:56.421 --> 00:04:03.046
Now the other provisions of the PPACA are based around the idea that, "If we want people to get insurance,

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:05.665
- then we need to make it easier for them to get insurance"

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:12.196
The biggest deal, at least in my mind, is this one covering Pre-Existing Conditions.

00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:20.123
Right now, if you have a Pre-Existing Condition, e.g. Cancer, and you do not have insurance, or your employer

00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:23.653
does not cover it - or perhaps you are unemployed - and if you try to get insurance on your own,

00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:28.467
you are likely to be denied. If you are offered insurance, it will be ridiculously expensive.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.644
This is because the insurance company knows that they're going to take a huge loss on paying

00:04:32.644 --> 00:04:40.029
all of your medical expenses. The PPACA says that you can no longer base the premiums, or whether

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.001
you will or not give someone insurance based on Pre-Existing Conditions.

00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:51.685
People will be charged premiums, which what you pay to receive the policy, based on age and geography.

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:58.669
So if you have two 40-year-olds, and one of them has the misfortune of having cancer,

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:06.748
the other not having any pre-existing conditions; and they both live in, let's say, in Virginia.

00:05:06.748 --> 00:05:13.077
Under this, they will pay the exact same amount for insurance, the same premium.

00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:18.139
These other two points are just to make it easier to get insurance. Right now, if you've

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.919
ever tried to get insurance, it can be really hard to compare and contrast policies,

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.390
and to really understand what you're getting and what you're not getting.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.810
So this part of the Act says that every state will set up one of these Insurance Exchanges, which will allow

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.804
for more transparency in terms of buying and selling policies.

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:38.960
And then this final part here, -though this is just an overview, I'm not covering everything, not all the details-

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.170
is the idea that the Government will also subsidize people getting policies, especially if they are in lower income

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.837
brackets, or in more difficult financial situations.

00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:54.193
Now on top of this, if you're deciding whether or not you support things, if you're saying,

00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:58.431
'This might be a good idea', or 'This is a bad idea' because you don't like the government forcing things

00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:06.225
like this, there is also the issue of the Cost. 
Now this whole thing, even thought there might be

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:11.325
savings in terms of lower medical care, because people would get preventative healthcare,

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:22.595
there is still a Net Cost to this. It will primarily be paid for by an increase to the Medicare Tax for

00:06:22.595 --> 00:06:36.479
high-income brackets. So it's really going to be larger Medicare taxes on people with larger incomes.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:43.800
This is estimated to generate about $200 Billion a year, (or $210 Billion, there are different estimates)

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.943
but that's going to bear most of the costs, and on top of that, there are some extra fees on insurers,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:56.555
as well as what's called an 'Excise Tax', which tends to be a large tax on a specific type of policy,

00:06:56.555 --> 00:07:04.066
which are referred to as 'Cadillac' policies. These policies are very very very generous. This will be used to make up some of the cost of all this.

00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:10.665
Once again, I'm not going to take any political sides on this, but hopefully this gives some clarity about what

00:07:10.665 --> 00:07:14.000
people are actually debating.
