00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.550
We're asked to add 4/9 and 11/12
and to write our answer

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.310
as a mixed number, and then
simplify and write our answer

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.240
as a mixed number.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.970
So here we have two fractions
we're adding together, but we

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.700
have different denominators.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.800
So whenever you add fractions,
the first thing you have to do

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.880
is check the denominators.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.840
If they're the same, you can
add, but if they're different

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.600
like this, you have to make
them have the same

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.580
denominator.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.860
So what we have to do is find
a number that both 9 and 12

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.890
will divide into, and that
will be our common

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.800
denominator, and you'll see
why both 9 and 12 have to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.970
divide into it.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.070
So let's think about what that
number is, and there's two

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.790
ways of coming up with that
what we could call a least

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.300
common multiple, the smallest
multiple of both 9

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.540
and 12 that is common.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.310
One way is just to kind of look
at the multiples of 9 and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.450
see if any of them are
divisible by 12.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.800
So if you start with 9--
we can do it over here.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.230
So you have 9, that's
not divisible by 12.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.810
18 isn't divisible by 12.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.810
27 isn't divisible by 12.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.670
36, well, that is
divisible by 12.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.480
That is 12 times 3.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.560
So 9 goes into 36 and
12 goes into 36.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.620
So what we want to do is write
a common denominator.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.870
So we're going to write 4/9 as
something over 36, and we're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.500
going to write 11/12 as
something over 36.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.370
Now, to turn your 9 into
a 36, you have to

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.720
multiply it by 4, right?

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.620
9 times 4 is equal to 36.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.240
Now, you can't just multiply
the denominator by 4.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.560
You also have to multiply the
numerator by the same thing.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.600
So if you multiply the numerator
by 4, you get 4

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.090
times 4 is 16.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.460
So 4/9 is the exact same
thing as 16/36.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.550
If you wanted to simplify this
one to 4/9, you divide the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.020
numerator and the denominator
by 4.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.010
Now, we do the same
thing over here.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:07.800
36, 12 times 3, so we're
multiplying 12 by 3 to get 36.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.030
Well, if we did that to the
denominator, we also have to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.180
do that to the numerator,
so 11 times 3 is 33.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.660
And just like that, we've now
rewritten each of the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.660
fractions so that they have
the same denominator.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.570
Both of their denominators
is 36.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.940
So now we're ready to add.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.170
If you add these two things,
we'll have 36, because we're

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.110
considering kind of parts of
36 or fractions of 36, and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.470
then we have 16 plus 33
in the numerator.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.420
Let me write that down.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.190
16 plus 33 in the numerator.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.620
And 16 plus 33 is what?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.020
6 plus 33 would be 39
and then you have

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.770
another 10, so it's 49.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:57.390
So it's equal to 49/36.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.360
Now, can we simplify this?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.650
49, it's 7 squared, so it has
1, 7 and 49 as factors.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.000
This has 1-- it has a bunch
of numbers, but it's not

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.770
divisible by 7, so this is
actually in simplest form, but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.400
this is an improper fraction.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.260
The numerator is larger
than the denominator.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.480
So let's write it as
a proper fraction.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.680
To do that, we divide
36 into 49.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.850
36 goes into 49 how
many times?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.440
Well, it only goes one
time, so it equals 1.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110
And how much will
be left over?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.130
If I divide 36 into 49 one time,
or 1 times 36 is 36,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.750
then I have 13 left
over to get to 49.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.460
So it's 1 and 13/36.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.100
And you can do that manually,
if you like you.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.960
You'd say 36 into 49.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.680
36 goes into 49 one time.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.130
1 times 36 is 36, and
then you subtract.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.770
9 minus 6 is 3.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.310
4 minus 3 is 1.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.740
You have a remainder of 13.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.090
So that's our answer:
1 and 13/36.
