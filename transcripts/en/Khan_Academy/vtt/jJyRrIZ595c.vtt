00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.610
So where we left off, I had
given you the question-- these

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.340
types of equations are fairly
straightforward.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.910
When we have two real
roots, then this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.685
is the general solution.

00:00:11.685 --> 00:00:13.650
And if you have your initial
conditions, you can

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.420
solve for c1 and c2.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.800
But the question I'm asking is,
what happens when you have

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.100
two complex roots?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.890
Or essentially, when you're
trying to solve the

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.260
characteristic equation?

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.680
When you're trying to solve
that quadratic?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.050
The B squared minus 4AC,
that that's negative.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.610
So you get the two roots end up
being complex conjugates.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.920
And we said OK, let's say that
our two roots are lambda plus

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.230
or minus mu i.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.770
And we just did a bunch
of algebra.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.710
We said, well if those are the
roots and we substitute it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.640
back into this formula for
the general solution,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.990
we get all of this.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.810
And we kept simplifying it, all
the way until we got here,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.505
where we said y is equal to e
to the lambda x, plus c1, et

00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:52.300
cetera, et cetera.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.830
And we said, can we simplify
this further?

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.740
And that's where we took out
Euler's equation, or Euler's

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.700
formula, or Euler's definition,
depending what you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.350
want, which I'm always in
awe of every time I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.290
see it or use it.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.420
But we've talked a lot about
that in the calculus playlist.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.100
We could use this to maybe
further simplify it, so I

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.610
wrote e to the mu xi as cosine
mu x plus i sine mu x.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.250
And I wrote e to the minus mu xi
is cosine minus mu x plus i

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.510
sine minus mu x.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.450
And now we could use a little
bit about what we know about

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.060
trigonometry.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.320
Cosine of minus theta is equal
to cosine of theta.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.300
And we also know that sine of
minus theta is equal to minus

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.740
sine of theta.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.260
So let's use these identities
to simplify this

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.010
a little bit more.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:54.355
So we get y is equal to e to
the lambda x times-- and we

00:01:54.355 --> 00:02:02.640
could actually distribute the c1
too-- so times c1 cosine of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:18.760
mu x, plus i times c1 sine of mu
x, plus-- all of this is in

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.670
this parentheses right here--
plus c2-- instead of cosine of

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.430
negative mu x, we know
this identity.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.390
So we can just write this as
cosine of mu x as well,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.540
because cosine of minus x is the
same thing as cosine of x.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.860
Plus i times c2-- sine of minus
mu x is the same thing

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.840
as minus sine of x.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.900
So actually, let's take this--
take the minus sine out there.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.630
So minus sine of mu x.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.165
And let's see, it seems like
we're getting to a point that

00:02:56.165 --> 00:02:58.240
we can simplify it even more.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.280
We can add the two cosine terms.
So we get the general

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.700
solution, and I know this
problem requires a lot of

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.130
algebraic stamina, but as long
you don't make careless

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.390
mistakes you'll find it
reasonably rewarding, because

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.390
you'll see where things
are coming from.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.680
So we get y-- the general
solution is y is equal to e to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.770
the lambda x, times-- let's
add up the two cosine mu x

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:33.320
terms. So it's c1 plus c2
times cosine of mu x.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.965
And let's add the two sine of
mu x terms. So plus i-- we

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:50.130
could call that c1i-- that's
that-- minus c2i

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.900
times sine of mu x.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.400
And we're almost done
simplifying.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.010
And the last thing we can
simplify is-- well you know c1

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.230
and c2 are arbitrary
constants.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.940
So let's just define this
as another constant.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.730
I don't know, let's call it--
I'll just call it c3, just to

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.470
not confuse you by using c1
twice, I'll call this c3.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.450
And now this might be a little
bit of a stretch for you, but

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.140
if you think about it, it
really makes sense.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.790
This is still just a
constant, right?

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.890
Especially if I say, you know
what, I'm not restricting the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.330
constants to the reals.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.300
c could be an imaginary
number.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.470
So if c is an imaginary number,
or some type of

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.510
complex number, we don't even
know whether this is

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.360
necessarily an imaginary
number.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.450
So we're not going to make
any assumptions about it.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.340
Let's just say that this is some
other arbitrary constant.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.050
Call this c4, and we can worry
about it when we're actually

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.700
given the initial conditions.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.370
But what this gives us, if we
make that simplification, we

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.910
actually get a pretty
straightforward, general

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.280
solution to our differential
equation, where the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.860
characteristic equation
has complex roots.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.370
And that I'll do it
in a new color.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:05.000
That is y is equal to e to
the lambda x, times some

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.220
constant-- I'll call it c3.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.740
It could be c1.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.970
It could be c a hundred
whatever.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.510
Some constant times cosine of
mu of x, plus some other

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.130
constant-- and I called it c4,
doesn't have to be c4, I just

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.120
didn't want to confuse it with
these-- plus some other

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.870
constant times the
sine of mu of x.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.940
So there's really two things
I want you to realize.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.560
One is, we haven't done
anything different.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.110
At the end of the day, we still
just took the two roots

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.740
and substituted it back into
these equations for r1 and r2.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.850
The difference is, we just kept
algebraically simplifying

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.020
it so that we got
rid of the i's.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.760
That's all we did.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.890
There was really nothing new
here except for some algebra,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.040
and the use of Euler's
formula.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.990
But when r1 and r2 involved
complex numbers, we got to

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.960
this simplification.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.840
So in general, as you get the
characteristic equation, and

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.630
your two roots are mu plus
or minus-- oh sorry, no.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.790
Your two roots are lambda plus
or minus mu i, then the

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.710
general solution is
going to be this.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.960
And, if you had to memorize it,
although I don't want you

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.110
to, you should be able to
derive this on your own.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.370
But it's not too hard to-- and
actually if you ever forget

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.320
it, solve your characteristic
equation, get your complex

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.010
numbers, and just substitute
it right

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.220
back in this equation.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.680
And then with the real numbers,
instead of the lambda

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.740
and the mu, with the real
numbers, just do the

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.540
simplification we did.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.400
And you'll get to the
exact same point.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.730
But if you're taking an exam,
and you don't want to waste

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.760
time, and you want to be able
to do something fairly

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.740
quickly, you can just remember
that if I have a complex root,

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.860
or if I have complex roots to
my characteristic equation,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.795
lambda plus or minus mu i, then
my general solution is e

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:07.000
to the lambda x, times some
constant, times cosine of mu x

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.070
plus some constant, times
sine of mu x.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.250
And let's see if we can do
a problem real fast that

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.310
involves that.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:22.760
So let's say I had the
differential equation y prime

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.600
prime plus the first
derivative plus

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.880
y is equal to 0.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.150
So our characteristic equation
is r squared plus r plus 1 is

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.790
equal to 0.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.780
Let's break out the
quadratic formula.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.030
So the roots are going to be
negative B, so it's negative 1

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.920
plus or minus the square root
of B squared-- B squared is

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.820
1-- minus 4 times AC-- well A
and C are both 1-- so it's

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.510
just minus 4.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.110
All of that over 2, right?

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.840
2 times A.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.620
All of that over 2.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.410
So the roots are going to be
negative 1 plus or minus the

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:11.010
square root of negative
3 over 2.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:14.980
Or we could rewrite this
as, the roots r.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:22.190
r is equal to negative 1/2 plus
or minus-- well we could

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.375
rewrite this as i times the
square root of 3, or square

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:31.292
root of 3i over 2.

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:34.049
Or we could write this is
as square root of 3

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.179
over 2 times i.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:38.350
Actually, that's the best
way to write it, right?

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:39.419
You just take the i out.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.280
So that takes the negative 1
out, and you are left with

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.880
square root of 3 over 2.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.020
So these are the roots.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.300
And now we if we want the
general solution we just have

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.120
to throw this right
back into that.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.700
And we'll have our
general solution.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.750
Let me write that
right down here.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:01.010
So our general solution will be
y is equal to e to the real

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.100
part of our complex conjugate.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.320
So e to the the minus
1/2 times x, right?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.220
This is our lambda.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.800
Times some constant-- I'll write
c1 now-- c1 times cosine

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:25.170
of the imaginary part without
the i-- so cosine of square

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:34.670
root of 3 over 2x, plus c2
times sine of square

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:40.250
root of 3 over 2x.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.360
Not too bad.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.880
We had complex roots and it
really didn't take us any more

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.320
time than when we had
two real roots.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.510
You just have to realize this.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.400
And then you have to just
find-- use the quadratic

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.390
equation to find the complex
roots of the

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.250
characteristic equation.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.980
And realize that
this is lambda.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.640
This minus 1/2 is lambda.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.150
And that the square root of
3 over 2 is equal to mu.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.780
And then substitute back into
this solution that we got.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.440
Anyway, in the next video, I'll
do another one of these

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.900
problems and we'll actually have
initial conditions, so we

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.550
can solve for c1 and c2.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.370
See you in the next video.
