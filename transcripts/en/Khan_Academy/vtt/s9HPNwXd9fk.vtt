00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.100
Before I dive into the mechanics
of how cells divide,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.810
I think it could be useful to
talk a little bit about a lot

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.730
of the vocabulary that
surrounds DNA.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.300
There's a lot of words and some
of them kind of sound

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.520
like each other, but they
can be very confusing.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.600
So the first few I'd like to
talk about is just about how

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.240
DNA either generates more DNA,
makes copies of itself, or how

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.580
it essentially makes proteins,
and we've talked about this in

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.220
the DNA video.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.340
So let's say I have a little--
I'm just going to draw a small

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.705
section of DNA.

00:00:30.705 --> 00:00:37.740
I have an A, a G, a T, let's say
I have two T's and then I

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.930
have two C's.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.000
Just some small section.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.400
It keeps going.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.010
And, of course, it's
a double helix.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.440
It has its corresponding
bases.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.780
Let me do that in this color.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.390
So A corresponds to T, G with
C, it forms hydrogen bonds

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.320
with C, T with A, T with
A, C with G, C with G.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280
And then, of course,
it just keeps

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.480
going on in that direction.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.770
So there's a couple of different
processes that this

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.310
DNA has to do.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.440
One is when you're just dealing
with your body cells

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.630
and you need to make more
versions of your skin cells,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.550
your DNA has to copy itself,
and this process is called

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.510
replication.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.920
You're replicating the DNA.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.190
So let me do replication.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.660
So how can this DNA
copy itself?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.750
And this is one of the beautiful
things about how DNA

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.320
is structured.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.770
Replication.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.120
So I'm doing a gross
oversimplification, but the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.600
idea is these two strands
separate, and it doesn't

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.240
happen on its own.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.510
It's facilitated by a bunch of
proteins and enzymes, but I'll

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.520
talk about the details of the

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.610
microbiology in a future video.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.744
So these guys separate
from each other.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:57.280
Let me put it up here.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.590
They separate from each other.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.190
Let me take the other guy.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.710
Too big.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.430
That guy looks something
like that.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.050
They separate from each other,
and then once they've

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.680
separated from each other,
what could happen?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.950
Let me delete some of that
stuff over here.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.900
Delete that stuff right there.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.600
So you have this double helix.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.410
They were all connected.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.230
They're base pairs.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.980
Now, they separate
from each other.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.010
Now once they separate, what
can each of these do?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.500
They can now become the template
for each other.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.410
If this guy is sitting by
himself, now all of a sudden,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.750
a thymine base might come and
join right here, so these

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.110
nucleotides will start
lining up.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.640
So you'll have a thymine and a
cytosine, and then an adenine,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.750
adenine, guanine, guanine,
and it'll keep happening.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.835
And then on this other part,
this other green strand that

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:56.210
was formerly attached to this
blue strand, the same thing

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.970
will happen.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.670
You have an adenine, a guanine,
thymine, thymine,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.770
cytosine, cytosine.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.550
So what just happened?

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.460
By separating and then just
attracting their complementary

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.670
bases, we just duplicated
this molecule, right?

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.280
We'll do the microbiology of it
in the future, but this is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.030
just to get the idea.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.370
This is how the DNA makes
copies of itself.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.190
And especially when we talk
about mitosis and meiosis, I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.030
might say, oh, this is the stage
where the replication

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.280
has occurred.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.460
Now, the other thing that
you'll hear a lot, and I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.900
talked about this in the DNA
video, is transcription.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.000
In the DNA video, I didn't focus
much on how does DNA

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.730
duplicate itself, but one of
the beautiful things about

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.420
this double helix design is
it really is that easy to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.160
duplicate itself.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.670
You just split the two strips,
the two helices, and then they

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.760
essentially become a template
for the other one, and then

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.410
you have a duplicate.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.200
Now, transcription is what needs
to occur for this DNA

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.380
eventually to turn into
proteins, but transcription is

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.870
the intermediate step.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.280
It's the step where you
go from DNA to mRNA.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.930
And then that mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell and goes

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.810
out to the ribosomes, and I'll
talk about that in a second.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.810
So we can do the same thing.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.760
So this guy, once again
during transcription,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.120
will also split apart.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.970
So that was one split there and
then the other split is

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.220
right there.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.240
And actually, maybe it makes
more sense just to do one-half

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.880
of it, so let me delete that.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.730
Let's say that we're just going
to transcribe the green

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.010
side right here.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.695
Let me erase all this stuff
right-- nope, wrong color.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:52.530
Let me erase this stuff
right here.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.860
Now, what happens is instead
of having deoxyribonucleic

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.030
acid nucleotides pair up with
this DNA strand, you have

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.950
ribonucleic acid, or RNA
pair up with this.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.620
And I'll do RNA in magneta.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.130
So the RNA will pair
up with it.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.480
And so thymine on the DNA side
will pair up with adenine.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.810
Guanine, now, when we talk about
RNA, instead of thymine,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.160
we have uracil, uracil,
cytosine, cytosine, and it

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.080
just keeps going.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.330
This is mRNA.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.070
Now, this separates.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.950
That mRNA separates, and
it leaves the nucleus.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.490
It leaves the nucleus, and then
you have translation.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.790
That is going from the mRNA to--
you remember in the DNA

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.280
video, I had the little tRNA.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.650
The transfer RNA were kind of
the trucks that drove up the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.100
amino acids to the mRNA, and
this all occurs inside these

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.150
parts of the cell called
the ribosome.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.030
But the translation is
essentially going from the

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.710
mRNA to the proteins, and we
saw how that happened.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.560
You have this guy-- let
me make a copy here.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.880
Let me actually copy
the whole thing.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:32.980
This guy separates, leaves the
nucleus, and then you had

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.060
those little tRNA trucks that
essentially drive up.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.820
So maybe I have some tRNA.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.420
Let's see, adenine, adenine,
guanine, and guanine.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.430
This is tRNA.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:44.230
That's a codon.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.650
A codon has three base pairs,
and attached to it, it has

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.540
some amino acid.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.750
And then you have some
other piece of tRNA.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.890
Let's say it's a uracil,
cytosine, adenine.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.305
And attached to that, it has
a different amino acid.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.530
Then the amino acids attach to
each other, and then they form

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:09.365
this long chain of amino acids,
which is a protein, and

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.840
the proteins form these weird
and complicated shapes.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.080
So just to kind of make sure you
understand, so if we start

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:23.510
with DNA, and we're essentially
making copies of

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.790
DNA, this is replication.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.430
You're replicating the DNA.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.270
Now, if you're starting with DNA
and you are creating mRNA

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.006
from the DNA template, this
is transcription.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.160
You are transcribing the
information from one form to

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.830
another: transcription.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.520
Now, when the mRNA leaves the
nucleus of the cell, and I've

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.200
talked-- well, let me just draw
a cell just to hit the

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.100
point home, if this is a whole
cell, and we'll do the

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.090
structure of a cell
in the future.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.870
If that's the whole cell, the
nucleus is the center.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.380
That's where all the DNA is
sitting in there, and all of

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.500
the replication and the
transcription occurs in here,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.310
but then the mRNA leaves the
cell, and then inside the

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.270
ribosomes, which we'll talk
about more in the future, you

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.470
have translation occur and
the proteins get formed.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:29.430
So mRNA to protein
is translation.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.230
You're translating from the
genetic code, so to speak, to

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.809
the protein code.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.059
So this is translation.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.030
So these are just good words to
make sure you get clear and

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.290
make sure you're using the right
word when you're talking

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.660
about the different processes.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.560
Now, the other part of the
vocabulary of DNA, which, when

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.250
I first learned it, I found
tremendously confusing, are

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.600
the words chromosome.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.120
I'll write them down here
because you can already

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:04.100
appreciate how confusing
they are: chromosome,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.590
chromatin and chromatid.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.210
So a chromosome, we already
talked about.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.760
You can have DNA.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.880
You can have a strand of DNA.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.530
That's a double helix.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.470
This strand, if I were to zoom
in, is actually two different

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.910
helices, and, of course,
they have their base

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.140
pairs joined up.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.730
I'll just draw some base pairs
joined up like that.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.470
So I want to be clear, when I
draw this little green line

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.630
here, it's actually
a double helix.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.340
Now, that double helix gets
wrapped around proteins that

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.590
are called histones.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.660
So let's say it gets wrapped
like there, and it gets

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.000
wrapped around like that, and
it gets wrapped around like

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.480
that, and you have here these
things called histones, which

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.730
are these proteins.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:12.890
Now, this structure, when you
talk about the DNA in

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.040
combination with the proteins
that kind of give it structure

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.060
and then these proteins are
actually wrapped around more

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.680
and more, and eventually,
depending on what stage we are

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.660
in the cell's life, you have
different structures.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.440
But when you talk about the
nucleic acid, which is the

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.420
DNA, and you combine that with
the proteins, you're talking

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.670
about the chromatin.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:39.100
So this is DNA plus-- you can
view it as structural proteins

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.170
that give the DNA its shape.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.640
And the idea, chromatin was
first used-- because when

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.460
people look at a cell, every
time I've drawn these cell

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.620
nucleuses so far, I've drawn
these very well defined-- I'll

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:55.150
use the word.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.120
So let's say this is
a cell's nucleus.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.060
I've been drawing very
well-defined structures here.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.840
So that's one, and then this
could be another one, maybe

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.420
it's shorter, and then it has
its homologous chromosome.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.410
So I've been drawing these
chromosomes, right?

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.790
And each of these chromosomes
I did in the last video are

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.270
essentially these long
structures of DNA, long chains

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.010
of DNA kind of wrapped tightly
around each other.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.790
So when I drew it like that, if
we zoomed in, you'd see one

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.830
strand and it's really
just wrapped

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.680
around itself like this.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.170
And then its homologous
chromosome-- and remember, in

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.500
the variation video, I talked
about the homologous

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.960
chromosome that essentially
codes for the same genes but

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.420
has a different version.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.640
If the blue came from the dad,
the red came from the mom, but

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.130
it's coding for essentially
the same genes.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:52.360
So when we talk about this one
chain, let's say this one

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.290
chain that I got from my dad of
DNA in this structure, we

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:58.660
refer to that as a chromosome.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.400
Now, if we refer generally-- and
I want to be clear here.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.950
DNA only takes this shape at
certain stages of its life

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:14.900
when it's actually replicating
itself-- not when it's

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.500
replicating.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.940
Before the cell can divide,
DNA takes this very

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.430
well-defined shape.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.240
Most of the cell's life, when
the DNA is actually doing its

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.700
work, when it's actually
creating proteins or proteins

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.080
are being essentially
transcribed and translated

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.380
from the DNA, the DNA isn't
all bundled up like this.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.630
Because if it was bundled up
like, it would be very hard

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:42.310
for the replication and the
transcription machinery to get

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.710
onto the DNA and make the
proteins and do whatever else.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.610
Normally, DNA-- let me draw
that same nucleus.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.780
Normally, you can't even see
it with a normal light

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.240
microscope.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.690
It's so thin that the DNA strand
is just completely

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.980
separated around the cell.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.160
I'm drawing it here so you can
try to-- maybe the other one

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.560
is like this, right?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.880
And then you have that shorter
strand that's like this.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.560
And so you can't even see it.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.500
It's not in this well-defined
structure.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.400
This is the way it
normally is.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.660
And they have the other short
strand that's like that.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.550
So you would just see this
kind of big mess of a

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.760
combination of DNA and proteins,
and this is what

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.410
people essentially refer
to as chromatin.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.540
So the words can be very
ambiguous and very confusing,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.980
but the general usage is when
you're talking about the

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.580
well-defined one chain of DNA
in this kind of well-defined

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.260
structure, that is
a chromosome.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:46.770
Chromatin can either refer to
kind of the structure of the

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.730
chromosome, the combination of
the DNA and the proteins that

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:54.450
give the structure, or it can
refer to this whole mess of

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.530
multiple chromosomes of which
you have all of this DNA from

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.100
multiple chromosomes
and all the

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.240
proteins all jumbled together.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.520
So I just want to
make that clear.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.990
Now, then the next word
is, well, what is

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.290
this chromatid thing?

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.310
What is this chromatid thing?

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.050
Actually, just in case I didn't,
I don't remember if I

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.550
labeled these.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.210
These proteins that give
structure to the chromatin or

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.890
that make up the chromatin or
that give structure to the

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.540
chromosome, they're
called histones.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.440
And there are multiple types
that give structure at

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.310
different levels, and we'll
do that in more detail.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.850
So what's a chromatid?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.780
When DNA replicates-- so
let's say that was

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.790
my DNA before, right?

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.400
When it's just in its normal
state, I have one version from

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.620
my dad, one version
from my mom.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.270
Now, let's say it replicates.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:48.680
So my version from my dad,
at first it's like this.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.240
It's a big strand of DNA.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.560
It creates another version of
itself that is identical, if

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:57.850
the machinery worked properly,
and so that identical piece

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.590
will look like this.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:01.470
And they actually are initially

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.150
attached to each other.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.000
They're attached to each other
at a point called the

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.250
centromere.

00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:10.850
Now, even though I
have two strands

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.310
here, they're now attached.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.860
When I have these two strands
that contain the exact-- so I

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:20.420
have this strand right here, and
then I have-- well, let me

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.180
actually draw it a
different way.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.090
I could draw it multiple
different ways.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.240
I could say this is one strand
here and then I have another

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.000
strand here.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.180
Now, I have two copies.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.120
They're coding for the
exact same DNA.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.330
They're identical.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.002
I still call this
a chromosome.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.470
This whole thing is still called
a chromosome, but now

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.400
each individual copy is
called a chromatid.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.660
So that's one chromatid and
this is another chromatid.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.950
Sometimes they'll call them
sister chromatids.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.740
Maybe they should call them twin
chromatids because they

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.580
have the same genetic
information.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.490
So this chromosome has
two chromatids.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.750
Now, before the replication
occurred or the DNA duplicated

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.540
itself, you could say that this
chromosome right here,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.570
this chromosome like a father,
has one chromatid.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.740
You could call it a chromatid,
although that tends to not be

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.610
the convention.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.100
People start talking about
chromatids once you have two

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.780
of them in a chromosome.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.760
And we'll learn in mitosis and
meiosis, these two chromatids

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.710
separate, and once they
separate, that same strand of

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:38.570
DNA that you once called a
chromatid, you now call them

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.380
individually chromosomes.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.600
So that's one of them, and then
you have another one that

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.370
maybe gets separated
in this direction.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.710
Let me circle that one
with the green.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.190
So this one might move away like
that, and the one that I

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.510
circled in the orange might
move away like this.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.820
Now, once they separate and
they're no longer connected by

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.290
the centromere, now what we
originally called as one

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.670
chromosome with two chromatids,
you will now refer

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.819
to as two separate
chromosomes.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.950
Or you could say now you have
two separate chromosomes, each

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.790
made up of one chromatid.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.530
So hopefully, that clears up a
little bit some of this jargon

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.240
around DNA.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.130
I always found it
quite confusing.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.359
But it'll be a useful tool
when we start going into

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.270
mitosis and meiosis, and
I start saying, oh, the

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.369
chromosomes become chromatids.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.970
And you'll say, like, wait, how
did one chromosome become

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.859
two chromosomes?

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.280
And how did a chromatid
become a chromosome?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.470
And it all just revolves
around the vocabulary.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.730
I would have picked different
vocabulary than calling this a

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.730
chromosome and calling each
of these individually

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.880
chromosomes, but that's
the way we have

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.920
decided to name them.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.520
Actually, just in case you're
curious, you're probably

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.750
thinking, where does this
word chromo come?

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.510
I don't know if you know
old Kodak film was

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.550
called chromo color.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.460
And chromo essentially
relates to color.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.910
I think it comes from the Greek
word actually for color.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.830
It got that word because when
people first started looking

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.000
in the nucleus of a cell, they
would apply dye, and these

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.480
things that we call chromosomes
would take up the

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.020
dye so that we could see it well
with a light microscope.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.540
And some comes from soma for
body, so you could kind of

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.560
view it as colored body,
so that's why

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.770
they call it a chromsome.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.920
So chromatin also will take up--
well, I won't go into all

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.530
of that as well.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.080
But hopefully, that clears
a little bit this whole

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.480
chromatid, chromosome, chromatin
debate, and we're

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.790
well equipped now to study
mitosis and meiosis.
