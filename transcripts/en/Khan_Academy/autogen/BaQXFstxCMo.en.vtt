00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.560
 . 

00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.610
 Let's solve some of the examples that have to do with the equations of lines that are 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.080
 In typical form 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.980
 In the past I have illustrated two pictures. They 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.470
 Intersection of inclination, y 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.630
 = mx + b 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.920
 It is in fact this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 This intersects the inclination 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.540
 We saw the point of inclination in the last view 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.190
 The y-value of y is taken on line 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.960
 X = x x - x value 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.670
 Line, when we have y value 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.830
 The point x1, y1 is located on the line 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.820
 This is an example of a tilt point model 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.180
 Now we will talk about the typical shape 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.790
 The typical format - let me type it here - is typical 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.680
 Put all the x and y statements on 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.170
 The left side of the equation 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.570
 If we have ax + by = c 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 I want to emphasize that all of them 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.190
 Different ways to write the same equation 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.655
 If you give these, you can manipulate them geographically 

00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.510
 So you get those or those 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.080
 If you give these, you can get one or the other 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.590
 They are all different ways of writing the same 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.110
 Relationship, or the same line 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.170
 So let's solve a bunch of examples 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.380
 We have a line here 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290
 We have a written equation in the form of the intersection of inclination 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.250
 The slope is 3, and the y-intersection is -8 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 Let's put it in a typical way 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.270
 We have to get 3x on 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.690
 The other side of the equation 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.465
 The best way I can do this - let me rewrite 

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:51.560
 Equation, y = 3x - 8 - Let's ask 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.180
 3x from both ends of the equation 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.500
 If we put 3x on both sides, let's ask 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.380
 3x, and ask 3x - what's left for us, in the right side of the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.600
 The equation? 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.470
 The left side becomes 3x + y = 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.560
 - 3x is deleted with -3x-- = 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.150
 8 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.050
 We finished 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.590
 This is typical 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.610
 The typical figure, I think is preferred when people are both 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.680
 The two sides are located on the left side 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280
 But it is not used when we want to find the inclination 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.130
 Intersection y 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.200
 I do not know what the slope is and the intersection y when you see 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.100
 In a typical form 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.490
 The preferred form is the intersection of the slope, because it shows us 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790
 Precise inclination and intersection 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.140
 The point of inclination, from the Saha find, you can look at it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.560
 Find the inclination 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.870
 But y intersection, you have to make a simple effort up 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.630
 Find it 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.315
 But at least you can go straight from the tilt and 

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:53.570
 The point lies on it 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.240
 But anyway, let's go from this equation, which is written 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.360
 The point of inclination, and get it in the typical form 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.640
 If we want to get it in the typical form, ie the same 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.250
 Equation but typical form 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.150
 And the good thing we'll do, let's distribute this, y 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.700
 - 7 = -5 x, or -5x, + 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.370
 -5 x-12 = 60 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.760
 Now, we want to put all the variables on the left side 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.190
 And all constants on the right side 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.440
 Let us add 7 to both sides of this equation 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.440
 + 7 for both ends of equation 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.800
 What do you become? 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.100
 Well, -7 disappear, due to 7 + 7 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.920
 And we have y = 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.000
 5x + 67- 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.370
 Now, if we want this x phrase to be on the left side, we can 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.010
 We add 5x for both parties 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.660
 Let's add 5x to the two sides of the equation 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 We'll get 5x = - these 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.880
 Delete - 67 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.620
 Now, we got the typical shape 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.230
 If you want the format to be the same, you can 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.579
 To rearrange them 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.685
 Will be 5x + y = 67 

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:23.390
 We're done 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.630
 Let us solve more of these examples 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.950
 This is not a point of inclination nor 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.070
 Model of intersection of inclination 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.920
 It's kind of 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.470
 Mixed shape 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.080
 This part seems like a point of inclination, but it seems 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.060
 As a different thing 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.710
 It's not exactly a point of inclination 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.490
 Let us see if we can manipulate them geographically until we transform them 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.050
 For the typical shape 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.570
 If we have 3y + 5 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:46.780
 Let's distribute the 4 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.950
 = 4x ​​- 36 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.920
 Let us do exactly as we did in the last example 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.370
 I used a different code as needed, so I explained to you 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.110
 Different things 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.320
 Instead of following this method, I will subtract 5 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.290
 From both sides, but I will do it on the same line 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.440
 I will subtract 5 from both parties 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.330
 The left side of Equation 3y becomes 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.220
 Because these two are deleted, this equals 4x 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.290
 Then what is the result of 36 - 5? 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.470
 = -41 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.000
 Now we want x expressions to be on the right side 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.330
 So let's subtract 4x from both ends of the equation 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.920
 If -4x +, then -4x 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.980
 What does the equation become? 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.330
 Well, the left side stays 4x + 3y- 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.400
 The right side, the reason I floated 4x is up 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.780
 Delete it with those 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.800
 We have 41 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.990
 We're done 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.970
 We got the typical shape 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.460
 Now, let's go the other way 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.220
 Let's start with some equations that are typical 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.090
 We find their inclination and y intersection 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.080
 The best way to know it is to find a tilt and 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.460
 The intersection of y is to put the equation at the intersection of the inclination 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.310
 If we want to make these equations 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.820
 Y = mx + b 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.740
 I will find the value of y 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.510
 Let's do it 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.420
 And the best thing to do here - let me rewrite it 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.860
 5x - 2y = 15 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.680
 Let's subtract 5x from both ends 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.530
 If - 5x +, we have -5x 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.690
 They are deleted 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.310
 And we have -y 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.580
 = 15 - 5x 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.750
 Now, let's divide everything over -2 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:54.960
 If we divide everything on -2, what will we get? 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.620
 The left side becomes y 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.530
 y = - 15 -2 -2 = -7.5 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.310
 Then -5 -2 -2 - you can imagine 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.540
 I am distributing the 1.2 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.410
 I divide each of them on -2 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.955
 If -5 -2 -2 = positive 2.5x 

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:20.210
 If -5 -2 -2 = positive 2.5x 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.820
 If you want to turn it into a cross-slope model 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.760
 You can say that y = - you can 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.030
 Reorder - 2.5x - 7.5 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.430
 We want to find the inclination 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.710
 he is here 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.490
 This is the tendency 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.070
 We want y intersection 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.690
 In fact, let me relax 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.110
 he is here 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.230
 Which is -7.5 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.520
 That is the intersection of y 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.090
 Now this will be the format 

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.650
 Which we can represent the equation by 

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.120
 let's do it 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.320
 Again, we'll need to find y 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.990
 Let's subtract 3x from both parties 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.100
 We get 6y = 25 - 3x 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.560
 Then you can divide both sides on 6 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.870
 The remaining y = 25/6 - 3/6 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.060
 Or -1 / 2x 

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.550
 If you really want it, you have to rearrange it 

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:22.980
 y = -1 / 2x + 25/6 

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.610
 Where is the tendency? 

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.890
 Here is the tendency 

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.670
 1.2, that is the inclination 

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.220
 Where do you cross y? 

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.790
 This is the y intersection 

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.030
 Or is b 

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.830
 Point 0.25 / 6 lies on the line 

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.240
 Let's solve one another 

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.929
 We will solve one another 

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.080
 We have 9x - 9y = 4 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.670
 For fun, let's begin by dividing the ends 

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:52.960
 Equation on 9 

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.080
 You do not have to do this 

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.100
 But it is somehow a fun way to 

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.460
 Transactions here automatically will become 1 

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.250
 If we divide the two ends of the equation to 9, then 

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.970
 Divided everything on 9, will become - in fact, well 

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.960
 Let's divide 

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.530
 Let's divide everything over 9 

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.010
 I do it for fun 

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.140
 This first phrase will become -x 

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.120
 The second phrase, we have -9. 

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.620
 -9, becoming positive y 

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.760
 Then the last phrase will become 

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.800
 4/9 

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.110
 Let me write this down 

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.540
 4/9 

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.380
 I'll leave some space here 

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.270
 Now, we want the x phrase to be on the right side, so let's add 

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.836
 x for the lateral equation 

00:09:39.836 --> 00:09:44.150
 Let us add x for both ends of the equation 

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.720
 We delete this 

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.960
 The equation y = x - 4/9 becomes the equation 

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.530
 Where is the tendency? 

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.460
 The slope is the x expression coefficient 

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.990
 Ie that inclination = 1 

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.270
 Where do you cross y? 

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.956
 Intersection y here
