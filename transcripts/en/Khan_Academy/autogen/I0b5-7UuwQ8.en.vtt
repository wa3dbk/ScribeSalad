00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.890
 Let's exercise a bit on the division of rational numbers, 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.300
 or another way to think about it is - 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.860
 fragmentation of fractions. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.039
 It is the same. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.020
 We have example (s), task 1. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.460
 "Find the reciprocal value 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.840
 of each of the following. " 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.960
 This means that if I have an 'a' number, 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.360
 its reciprocal value will be 1 / a. 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.580
 When I pick up a number and multiply it 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.660
 on its reciprocal value, I will receive a / a, 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.120
 which equals 1. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.300
 'a' at its recyclable value will be equal to 1. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.880
 Let's solve these tasks. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.160
 Example (a). 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 We have 100. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.460
 Reciprocal value of this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.130
 is just 1/100. 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.810
 And if you multiply this, you get 1. 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.730
 Example (b). 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.040
 I will make all the examples. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.950
 We have 2/8. 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.530
 The reciprocal of 2/8 is 1 / (2/8), which is the same thing - 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.320
 this is equal to 1 on the reciprocal value of this. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.960
 By 8/2, which is the same as 4. 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 Now you can immediately notice something. 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.760
 I guess you see a model here. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.820
 If you take 1 on a liver, 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 the result is that the liver is turning. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940
 The reciprocal of 2/8 is 8/2. 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640
 You simply change the positions of the numerator and the denominator. 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.150
 Let's apply this to example (c). 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.760
 If I have - (19/21), its reciprocal value will simply be - 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 You change the positions of the numerator and the denominator. 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.720
 - (21/19). 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.690
 And if you multiply these two numbers, 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.270
 you will get 1. 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 Negative characters will be destroyed. 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100
 21 and 21 will be shortened, 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.320
 19 and 19 will be shortened. 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.600
 Example (d). 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.280
 The reciprocal of 7 - my mind began to confuse, 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.560
 the reciprocal value is 1/7. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.240
 Lastly, let's solve E. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.000
 Reciprocal yields z3 on - 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 this is minus z ^ 3 on 2u ^ 3. 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.150
 Reciprocal value of this - one of the more difficult 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
 words for me - it will be equal to ... 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.440
 this is reciprocal, it will be equal to 1 on this, 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.200
 which just will be minus - 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.180
 the denominator becomes a numerator - 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.080
 - (2) (3) (3) 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.190
 Let's move on to the next section. 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.610
 "Divide the following rational numbers. 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.400
 Make sure your answer is in its simplest form. " 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.650
 I will solve these tasks through one, 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.010
 just not to waste your whole time. 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.195
 Let's do the first: example (a). 

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:47.890
 I'll do it here. 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.170
 Example (a). 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
 5/2 divided by 1/4. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.900
 It's the same as 5/2 by 4/1. 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 The division of something is the same as multiplication 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.300
 on its reciprocal value. 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.580
 I multiply by the reciprocal value of 1/4. 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.670
 This will be equal to - we can divide 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.840
 the numerator and the denominator of 2, so 4 becomes 2, 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.360
 and 2 becomes 1. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.020
 5 by 2 is 10/1, so it's just 10. 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.040
 Example (b). 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.440
 Or let me decide on one. 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.500
 (c) 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.300
 5/11 divided by 6/7. 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.260
 Again, it's the same as 5/11 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.620
 by the reciprocal of 6/7, ie 7/6. 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.720
 And this is 5 at 7 is 35, on 66. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 And this is the simplest kind of thing. 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.020
 Let's see (is). 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.220
 We have - (x / 2) divided by 5/7. 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 Again, it is the same as - (x / 2) 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.470
 7/5, which is equal to - (7x / 10). 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.390
 I think it becomes clear. 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.050
 Let's make an example (g). 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.220
 We have - (1/3) divided by - (3/5). 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.100
 This will be the same as - (1/3) 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.650
 on the reciprocal of this, (5/3). 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.600
 I just changed the positions of the numerator and the denominator. 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.030
 This will be equal to - the negative signs are destroyed. 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.160
 Negatively negative is positive. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.860
 1 in 5 is 5. 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.540
 3 in 3 is 9. 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.490
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.440
 Let us decide (i). 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.740
 Example (i). 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.790
 11, divided by - (x / 4). 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.440
 Again, this is the same as 11 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.000
 on the reciprocal of this. 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.460
 Reciprocal value, by - (4 / x). 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.160
 And if it confuses you - 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680
 I really do not have to write multiplication. 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.665
 It looks like x. 

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.980
 I have to say that this is the same as 11 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.800
 in (4 / x). 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.180
 Or you can look at this as a 11 / 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.340
 you can see this as (-4) on x, 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.360
 and the total is equal to (-44) / x or - (44 / x). 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.340
 Let us decide this last example. 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.460
 "The world's largest excavator, Bagger 288, 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.360
 is moving at 3/8 miles per hour. " 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.620
 So his speed, or his agility, 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.520
 is equal to 3/8 miles per hour. 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.560
 We can record it like that. 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.260
 Millions in the hour. 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.120
 "How long will it take to the excavator 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.000
 to excavate a 2/3 mile long ditch? " 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.180
 We want to go a distance that is equal to 2/3 miles. 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.140
 We'll just remember that the distance 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.700
 is always equal to the speed of time. 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.540
 Our distance is 2/3 miles. 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.820
 This will be equal to the speed, 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.100
 3/8 miles per hour, 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.800
 at the time. 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.820
 Or we can divide the two sides at 3/8 miles per hour, 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.020
 if we divide the two sides at 3/8 miles per hour, 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.850
 we will get the time. 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.661
 We divide at 3/8 miles per hour. 

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:13.980
 We divide at 3/8 miles per hour. 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.620
 These are destroyed. 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.510
 We will get that time equal to that. 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.300
 We have 2/3 miles. 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.420
 Let me write it this way. 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.150
 2/3 miles, divided by 3/8 miles per hour. 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.620
 Or another way to think about it is, 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.660
 that it is the same as the reciprocal, 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:49.980
 8/3 hours per mile. 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.400
 We just take the reciprocal value. 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.450
 We shared this. 

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.120
 It is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal value. 

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.310
 And we also turned the units of measurement. 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.350
 And we see that units of measurement are being destroyed. 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.820
 Dear Milestone, Dear Milestone. 

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.360
 There are hours left. 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.040
 And this is equal to - 

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.160
 2 at 8 is 16, 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.600
 on 3 at 3, 9. 

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.250
 It's 16/9 hours. 

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.080
 Hour and 7/9 or 1 whole and 7/9 hours, 

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.020
 to dig out 2/3 of a mile.
