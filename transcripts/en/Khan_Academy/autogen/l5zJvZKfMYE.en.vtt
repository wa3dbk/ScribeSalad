00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.310
 Let's say that we have a path at the xy level 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 This is the Y axis, and this is the x-axis, in the mesari 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.760
 It will look like this. 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.280
 Let's say it looks like it; try to draw a bit of 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.480
 A default path, let's say we'll go in a clockwise direction 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.450
 Like it along our course. 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.180
 We could call this path - where we are going in reverse direction 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.180
 Clock - we can call this path C. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.730
 Suppose we also have a vector field. 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.335
 Our field will be a bit unusual; 

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.190
 Will be called P. 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.270
 P from the level XY. 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.870
 That it only has a component i, or that all its vectors are only 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.240
 Complications of component i, which represents the unit vector. 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.410
 So P from level x is a multiplicity of the vector of unit i. 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.920
 There is no component i, so if you have a conception of 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.880
 This vector field, all these vectors, are multiples 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.980
 Of the unit vector i. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.040
 Or they can be reversible complications, where they can 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.960
 They also go in this direction. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 But they do not go in a diagonal direction or they do not go up. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.630
 They all go in a direction from left to right or from right to left. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.660
 This is what the vector field will look like. 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.870
 Now what I'm interested in is knowing 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.170
 · Linear integration along the path of CSS-C or C-orbit 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.710
 The CSS path is C-of-P, point, and integrator on r, which is our standard only 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.775
 Type as a way to solve linear integration. 

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.140
 We have seen what DR means in the past. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:40.760
 dr is equal to dx multiplied by i plus dy multiplied vector unit j. 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.250
 You might say, is not dx dt multiplied by dt? 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.530
 Let me write it down: Can not write dr like dt, dx multiplied 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.780
 dti plus dy and dt multiplied by dtj? 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.280
 And it can, but if I imagine these differences 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 It can be canceled, and you're just left with the DX and 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.490
 dy, we have seen it several times. 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.360
 I will leave it on this form because we hope if 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.390
 We are careful, we will not have to deal with the third lab 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.540
 The third parameter t. 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.240
 So let's just look at it in this ha-here shape with 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.120
 Just dx and dy. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.580
 So this integration can be rewritten as a linear integration, 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.040
 Curve C - Let me do this here below. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.600
 Linear integration on the path of the C curve from the point P dr. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.750
 So we'll take the multiplication for each transaction, let's say 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.610
 That the parameter for component i, so we get the P - I will do so 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:47.450
 In green, in fact I will do this in purple - until we get P of the XR multiplied 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.770
 dx plus - well there is no zero multiplied by j dy multiplied by zero multiplied by dy 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.290
 Will produce zero - well this is our simplified linear integration 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.330
 So here it is. 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.890
 This is equal to this original integration at the top here, where we are 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.110
 Literally we will just take linear integration around this path. 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.890
 Now I said we were playing with our cards, we do not have to 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.090
 Dealing with the third variable, t; so we may be 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.230
 Are able to resolve this integration only in terms of x. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.700
 So let's see if we can do that. 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.640
 So let's look at the small and great points for x. 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.410
 Those look like our smallest point for x. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.250
 Let us call that. 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.940
 Let us call our tenth point as the maximum; let us call that b. 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.260
 What we can do we can break up this curve in 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.500
 The two functions are x. y Functions x. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.750
 So this down here one can call it y1 x. 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.570
 This is just a standard curve; you know when we were just 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.940
 Handle the standard calculus, that's just because you can 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.570
 Imagine this and X and x function. 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.900
 This is the x2 y2. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.090
 Just like that. 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.470
 So you can imagine two paths; one path is determined by y1 X- 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.800
 Let me do it in a different color; purple - one track 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.340
 Set it to x1 as we go from x to x equals 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.110
 Equals B, and another path then set it x x2 as we 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.230
 Going from x is equal to B to S. 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.330
 This is our curve. 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.550
 So what we can do, we can write this integrated - 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.820
 It is the same thing that is integral - as this is equal 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.790
 Integrated - we will first track this I-X go 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:40.130
 From to BBS. 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.670
 I can say p l x and y, but we know along this 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.440
 The y-path of the x function. 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.290
 Therefore we say y1 of x and x. 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.220
 Wherever we see r we replace it with 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.910
 y1 x, dx. 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.030
 That will cover this first course; I will do so in the same color. 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.430
 We can imagine that this is c1. 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.180
 This is kind of the first half of our curve - well it's not 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.820
 Exactly which takes half - but that we have the right of that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.990
 Point to that point. 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.430
 And then we want to complete the circle. 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.960
 Maybe you will, and I will do so in yellow. 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.390
 Which will be equal - sorry we are going to 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.920
 Add these two-plus integers of x equal to b 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:37.290
 x is equal - we do it in this same color of x. 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.230
 Now y2 will be y. 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.180
 Wherever you see Y, you can replace with y2 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.890
 X along this curve. 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.350
 y2 x, dx. 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.650
 This is actually getting interesting, you 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.090
 We may already see where I'm going with this. 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.130
 This is the c2 curve. 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.030
 Very I think you would appreciate if you take the c1 and union 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.440
 c2, we've got our whole curve. 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.690
 So let's see if we can simplify this little integrated. 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.710
 One good thing we want to do, we may want to make 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.130
 Their end points are the same. 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.150
 So if you swap a bb here, it just turns 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.180
 Negative integral. 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.810
 Where you can make this to AB, which is in, and then do so 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.290
 Plus sign in subtraction. 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.000
 Now we have to rewrite the whole thing as equals 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:33.810
 Integrated from to B for this thing, V and Y1 from 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:44.290
 x minus this thing, minus P of x and y2 for x, and then 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.840
 All that times dx. 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.310
 I type it in a third color. 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.740
 Now, I'm going to do something a bit arbitrary, though 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.190
 I think you'll appreciate why I did this by the end of this 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.000
 Video, and that once the process is very simple. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.580
 What I'm going to do I'm going to swap these two. 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.490
 So basically I'm going to double this whole thing off 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.020
 Negative 1, or basically hit and split 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.910
 1 negative. 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.310
 So I could hit this negative first and then hit 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.705
 The exterior before the negative 1, will not be changed 

00:07:10.705 --> 00:07:13.290
 Integrated; I hit twice before negative 1. 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.810
 So if you swap these two things, if I multiply inside times 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.250
 1 negative, since this will be equal to - doing abroad 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.770
 From integration, to b. 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.460
 If I hit the inside - I'll do dx here - if I'm 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.790
 Hit inside the negative 1 integration, 

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.510
 Switch these two players. 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:36.230
 So it becomes P x of y2 x. 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:46.310
 And then you're going to be minus P x and y1 x. 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.920
 Get my hands a little chaotic. 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.420
 But I just can not just multiply the inside with subtraction 1. 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.250
 Do not want to change the integrated, so I multiplied 

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.480
 Inside Banqas 1, let me hit the outside 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.140
 Of minus 1. 

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.160
 Since multiplied minus 1 twice, these two 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.120
 Things equivalent. 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.840
 Or it can be said that this is no denying because. 

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.400
 Either way, I think that I appreciate that I own 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.430
 Integration has changed at all, and numerically. 

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.790
 I am multiplied at home and abroad minus 1. 

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.130
 Now I'm going to do the next step, it might sound a little bit 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.780
 Foreign to you a bit, but I think you will appreciate it. 

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.460
 It may be obvious to you if you have done recently 

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.320
 Some double integrations. 

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:30.270
 So this thing can be rewritten as incomplete from integrated to 

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:38.660
 B - Let me do a new color-P function, 

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:49.460
 y evaluate the y2 subtraction x - let me make it very clear; 

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.970
 This is y equals y2-x minus this rating function 

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.520
 In y equals y1 x. 

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.820
 And of course all those times are dx. 

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.380
 This statement and what we have seen here - and this 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:14.090
 Statement right here - exactly identical. 

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:20.000
 Hence if we assume that a partial derivative of capital P 

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.590
 As for the existing r, we hope you'll realize-and 

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.870
 This will focus a little because I do not want to 

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.700
 Mix you up on the move. 

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.880
 Let me write out this integral. 

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.180
 This will be equal to - this kind of stylish 

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.150
 Results, we started building on a very neat 

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.490
 The final document, which probably will have to take the next video to 

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.210
 Do - so do dx out. 

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.830
 If we assume that the capital P has derived the partial, this 

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.410
 Right here is exactly the same. 

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.550
 This right here is the same thing as partial 

00:09:54.550 --> 00:10:01.860
 P is derived for y, dy, anti-adaptive of 

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:10.010
 That from y1 x to y2 x. 

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.040
 I want to make you feel comfortable that these two 

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.740
 Things equivalent. 

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.800
 And realize that they are the equivalent, you probably 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.310
 You just have to start here and then go to it. 

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.540
 We used to see this; we used to see double 

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.100
 The parcel of like this, and then the very first step say, okay 

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.500
 To solve this dual integration we start the integral inside 

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.210
 Right there, we say, "OK" let's take an antirative 

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.870
 This is for yes. 

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.420
 So if you take the micro-integrative 

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.830
 For y, you're going to end up with a p. 

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.330
 And since these are integrated, specific, limits 

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.420
 In terms of x, you evaluate it 

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.020
 From y equals x y2, you're going to subtract from 

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.210
 That y equals y1 x. 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.200
 Usually we start with something like this, we 

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.610
 Go to something like that. 

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.620
 This kind of unusual that we started, we kind of solved, and we 

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.030
 Started with a clear integrated solution, and then 

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.150
 We slowly built into a specific integrated. 

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.400
 So hopefully you realize that this is correct, and that this 

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.110
 Just kind of we're going in reverse direction 

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.020
 Which we usually do. 

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.750
 And if you realize that, then you've just created 

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.850
 Very neat result. 

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.880
 Because what is this right here? 

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.570
 Let me go again, let me see if it can fit everything. 

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.745
 I have some function - I am assuming that partial of 

00:11:25.745 --> 00:11:29.790
 P exists for y-but has some function 

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.510
 Find out about the XY plane. 

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.490
 As you know, we can imagine that we are dealing in 

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.390
 The three dimensions now. 

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.980
 We will draw a little bit fussy. 

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:46.110
 Where y is, which is x, which is z, so these, you can imagine, 

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.560
 Is some surface; it just happens to be a partial 

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.350
 P for the tenth. 

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.790
 So it's some surface on board xy like this. 

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.170
 And what are we doing? 

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.310
 We take integrated double under this surface, 

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.250
 Around this area. 

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.580
 Limits are defined in the region in terms of y 

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.180
 y2 and y1 of x. 

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.160
 So you literally have this curve. 

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.500
 This is y2 at the top, y1 at the bottom. 

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.590
 And we mainly do the above size. 

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.190
 So if you imagine with the rule - the whole word for this 

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:32.060
 The area will be within this curve, and then rise 

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:36.070
 The function will be partial of P for y. 

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.700
 It is about to be a bit hard for me to draw, but this is 

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.670
 Basically some kind of volume, if you want to 

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.610
 Imagine it that way. 

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:52.780
 But the results are really neat here if you call this area 

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.600
 r, only we have simplified this line integrated. 

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.580
 This was a special one. 

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.270
 It was only an x ​​element, vector pathology, but we only have 

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.310
 Simplifying this embedded line is being equivalent to - perhaps 

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.080
 I would like to write this integrated line because that's what it is in 

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.830
 Really neat results. 

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.130
 We just created that thing here, right that 

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.970
 Is the same as our original one, so let me write this down. 

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:22.570
 The enclosed line is enclosed around the G curve of x, dx, 

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.300
 We just created that this is the same thing as 

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.980
 Double integrated cross zone r- This is the region 

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:40.333
 r-On Part F in relation to yes. 

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:52.120
 We can write de, dx, or da can write, whatever you 

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.810
 Want to write, but this is dual integration 

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.310
 Across that area. 

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.560
 The neat thing here is the use of a vector field that was only 

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.850
 x-component, we were able to connect an embedded line 

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.730
 Dual integration above the area - oh, I forgot 

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.000
 Something very important. 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.420
 We had a negative sign here. 

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.700
 So this was an introduction here. 

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.390
 Or we could even put the subtraction here, but I think you 

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.940
 Get a general idea. 

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.450
 In the next video clip, I'm going to do the exact same thing with 

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.710
 It only has vector vector area in the direction-r. 

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.240
 And then we'll do both and we'll end up 

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.560
 With Greene's theorem.
