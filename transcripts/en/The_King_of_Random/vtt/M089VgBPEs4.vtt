00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.820
Hey guys welcome back i'm nate with the king of random and today

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.449
We're going to make a fun device that makes bubble foam balloons that float into the air

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.409
similar devices are used to make floating foam shapes that serve as

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.660
Advertisements, but I really just think that they are fun to make and play with the purpose of today's video is to find an easy

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.859
Way to make this machine that can produce these foam flying balloons. Here's the materials

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.079
We're going to need for this project a flat pan

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
I find that straight walled pans work better than pie tins this was less than a dollar at Walmart

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.790
Some thin vinyl tubing I got this stuff for 15 cents per foot and about six feet is plenty a tank of helium

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.089
Which you can get at Walmart or most party stores for around 30 bucks

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.909
Bubble soap a glue gun and some extra glue sticks a lighter or torch and a couple of pins

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.719
Now that we have all of our parts and tools, let's get started first

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.619
Let's use our glue gun and use a little bit of hot glue to plug up one end of our vinyl tube

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.229
Now we've glued up the end of our tube, let's glue it to the center of our cake pan

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.219
Add some extra glue going over the top of the tube to help secure it permanently in place

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.759
In a spiral let's move out from the middle gluing down the tube all the way

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.289
Using extra glue secure the tube near the edge, and at least one more spot in the middle of the coil

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.229
Okay guys now that we've got our tube glued down in a spiral in the bottom of our pan

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.929
Let's add some small holes to make our bubbles first

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.509
Let's take our straight pin and heat the tip up using our lighter

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.509
Then we use the hot tip of the pin to poke holes in our vinyl tubing do this about every 3/4 inches along the tube

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.680
OK, we've taken our tube

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.189
And we filled it with a lot of tiny holes and now we want to test that all those holes work

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.270
Otherwise we're gonna

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.240
Get some lopsided foam balloons as the air comes out of one side

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.069
but not the other the easiest way to test if the holes are working is to fill your mouth with water and then blow the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:55.330
water down through the tube

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.089
It'll create a tiny fountain from every hole in the tube and you'll be able to see which ones may have become clogged back up

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.619
If you see any without a jet of water coming out of them you need to heat your pin back up and melt a new

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.809
Hole all the holes in our tubes seem to be working

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.700
Well, which means our foam bubbler is complete?

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.380
And it's time to start adding bubble soap and making foam we actually don't want to use pure bubble soap

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.559
It's a little bit of a heavier liquid and so even with helium in it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.619
It's heavy enough that it won't float very well, so what we actually want is about one part bubble soap and seven parts water

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.189
Gently stir the bubble soap in the water to get a nice even mixture

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.190
We want to make sure there's enough bubble solution to cover the vinyl tubing

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.130
But we don't want it to fill the pan there should be some exposed edge still

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.339
Now we need some helium the vinyl tube should fit snugly over the nozzle that comes attached to the helium tank

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.299
Just like that our foam bubbler is complete now. Let's take this outside and make some floating foam balloons at this point

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.619
We just undo the stopper on the tank press down on the valve and helium will start forming bubbles in our pan

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.240
There it is

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.349
Oh

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.940
I do find we get better and more consistent?

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.759
Results if we grow the bubbles out slowly instead of opening the valve as far as it will go I think by going slowly it

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.739
Allows time for the excess bubble fluid to drain off of the phone. That's forming, so it doesn't weigh it down

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.220
Oh broke free there we go

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.579
Now because all of the bubbles are full of helium as the tower grows it just sort of keeps itself straight up this lets you

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.250
Grow the tower taller and taller until too many bubbles pop, or it has enough lift that it pulls itself right off

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.400
Or you can still see the last 100

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.639
Wind wind has liberated the bubbles

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.680
Okay, I added more bubble solution into the pan

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.470
So there's more if it covering up the vinyl tubes and what appears to happen is that I have a lot smaller bubbles now

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.529
I'm not 100% sure if that's gonna be a good thing or a bad thing yet

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
I'm liking the look of this😆

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080
There it goes there 😃

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:53.160
It goes it's like a big white caterpillar going up and all the tree caught it. I'm gonna try and free it I

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.480
Go they got let go hmmm, I think it lives there now

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.720
Sticking to my hand, but I think I'm gonna shake it off, and it's gonna take off into the air there it goes and

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.919
It's completely changed direction apparently

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.550
Be free little cloud

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.580
bubble balloon

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.850
Wow

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.009
There it goes there it goes

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.770
Launching off into the sky

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.609
That looks like a giant flavorless cheeto oh

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600
It's cruising

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.939
I'm gonna try making some smaller ones

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.530
Sometimes right after you take it off

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:09.500
It's still kind of dripping extra bubble soap, so if you just give it a second. It'll start pulling more and more

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.810
Oh

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.210
Little heavy oh there you go

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.519
You can see as it starts dripping off some of the excess it will gain a little bit more altitude

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.380
It's alive

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.059
It does kind of look alive like it's just moving in the wind and it's just

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.210
Like a weird tentacle growing out of the cake pan

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.750
Tentacle cake it's a new kind of cake

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.290
What wind aah

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.190
It's stuck in the trees and powerlines right there

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:10.360
It's just bubbles so can you imagine how confused you would be if something like that just sort of like drifted into your yard

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.449
You'd have no idea what that was that'd be kind of weird

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:19.210
I'm gonna see what happens if I just push on the vowel as far as it'll go and give it like full power helium

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.559
All right that was a little anticlimactic. Wonder if our helium running low

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.020
Go go go go go

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.610
Guys this was great it was so cool to just watch those foam balloons launching up into the sky

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:52.099
This is a quick and easy build that you can do at home

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.920
and it's a ton of fun to play with I've got some crazy ideas about how to scale this up in the future including I

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.219
Want to try making a bubble pan that's several feet across a couple other things

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.839
I want to try are this helium that comes for filling balloons is actually not pure grade helium

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:12.019
It's helium mixed with about 20% air so I think we might get some better lift if we use some industrial-strength helium

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:17.419
and then of course I also want to try using hydrogen so we can make some foam balloons that will light on fire when you

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.889
Hit them with a flame there you have it now. You know how to make your very own foam balloon machine

00:09:22.019 --> 00:09:25.429
Thank you for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.209
There's no wind in here. It's great. Just keep going

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.180
No, don't get stuck in the other

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.909
Be free, be free yes, no

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:45.079
You can get it touch the ceiling

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.449
If I have enough helium for that you can do it little foam Tower you can do it draw

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:54.469
Since it's like soap. Do you think it will clean the ceiling off a little bit?

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.779
Go go go your so close like an inch away. We've done it. We've done it. We're touching the ceiling

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.469
Hey guys I have seen your comments begging me to come back into the videos and although I can't do that right now

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.920
I really do appreciate how much you care even though you can't see me

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.969
I'm still very much a part of this channel and a part of these videos, and I still love you just as much
