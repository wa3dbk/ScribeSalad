00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.020
Whoa!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.200
Hey what's up guys? Welcome back, I'm Grant
Thompson - The King of Random

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.160
And I'm Derek, I run a channel called Veritasium.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.420
Today we're here to answer a comment request from pandapika

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.240
Who wants to know does the
backyard metal foundry get hot enough to melt glass

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.740
That's we're here to find out

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.480
so what kind of glass are we going to try to melt

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.440
So I guess there's different
types of glass, there's borosilicate

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
and there's soda lime glass. Most of the world's glass is soda lime.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.460
So I just went out in the grocery store and I picked up some of this Dr Pepper because it's the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.420
one that I found in the glass bottles and
I'm thinking what we're probably going to do

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.140
is just empty these bottles place them
down the foundry, fire it up and just see

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.580
what it takes to melt them if in fact
they will melt at all

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.880
so the question we're going to try and
answer today, is does this cheap o little

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.690
backyard foundry actually get hot enough
to melt glass, soda lime glass? We're not

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.820
sure we're going to put it to the test
and watch what happens

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.060
borosilicate glass has boric oxide in, I think it's B₂O₃ and that just

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.160
makes that glass a much less expansive
when the temperature changes

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.559
which is really good that will help you avoid
thermal shock so you're doing anything

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.220
with wild temperature swings, this is the kind of glass borosilicate glass is what you want to use

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.339
Let's get this thing fired up!
Look at the size of this thing

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.250
I accidentally ordered this off Amazon
it's much bigger than I was anticipating

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.300
but I think it's going to work great.
That is a huge crucible.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.080
We'll stick that down right in the middle, one of our glass bottles should tuck in there

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.390
nicely I think but I think first we'll
just go ahead and get that ripping hot

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.960
and ideally that's going to fit right in
there but we will want to remove the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
contents first or else you may be
dealing with a small explosion

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.480
soda explosions we're not going to worry too much about the labels because those are going to burn right off, I promise.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.380
I'm looking forward to seeing grant fire this up

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.080
I've never seen Grant in action so
I'm looking forward to it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.740
It's all you dude

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.380
Derek: All right, firing it up
Grant: All right here we go

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.440
Woohoo! (Derek: Is it on?) That's it

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.440
so what's happening now is the two jets are forming a twirling vortex of fire
that's surrounding the crucible there, and we're going to

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.280
put this lid on to keep as much heat
in as we can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.880
Derek: It sounds like a hog, like a .. almost like a Harley or something. You know?

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.900
So we're just gonna let that sit for about 10 to 15 minutes to let that crucible

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.400
warm up when it's glowing red-hot
we bring out the glass

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.740
quick update guys

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.280
this thing's been running for about 15
to 20 minutes now I think it's about as

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.180
hot as we can get it, so we're going to have
Derek go ahead and take the lid off and

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.200
we are going to throw some glass down inside
Derek: Let's do it

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.580
Grant: Ohh yeah, that is hot, hot stuff

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.040
Okay, here's a glass bottle number one. Ready?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.140
You can see the label starting to burn
off a little bit the flames are coming up you can see that bite

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.500
Derek: Yeah that swirling motion. You think it's going to crack, or what?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.480
Grant: There's a chance it could crack but I actually don't know.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.540
Derek: You don't think it's going to smash up in our faces? I'm trusting you here.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.580
Grant: I don't think it will, if I'm being honest I don't think it will.
-Laughing-

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.580
Derek: Is it melting already?

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.680
Grant: It does look like it's melting already, 
Derek: On the side 
Grant: I wasn't sure if that was just

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.910
playing tricks on me 
Derek: It melted pretty quick

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.360
Grant: What the heck? There's no way that that melted. We didn't even put the lid on yet.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.000
What? You got to be kidding me. What? Look at that, it's just melting down into a puddle.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.140
Derek: I did not expect to see that so soon
Grant: You know, I was expecting we'd have to put the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.530
lid on and get it quite about hotter
than that but no just sitting in the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.090
crucible for 30 45 seconds and it started toppling on it's own, that really took

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.980
me off-guard. This is amazing look at it this. Look at that!
Derek: It's like a puddle in a minute.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.540
Grant: Guys my expectations already absolutely blown out of the
water I was hoping the foundry would

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.200
melt glass I had no idea it would melt
glass that quickly
Derek: Like that

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.640
Grant: We didn't even have to put the lid back on
Derek: No, it was the the bottom actually melting and the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.980
whole thing was toppling over crumpling down until essentially a puddle of glass liquid

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.620
Grant: I'm just going to turn the gas off
for a second
Derek: Are you going to pull that out?

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.940
Grant: I just want to see what kind of condition this- 
Look at that! Oh...

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.460
Derek: It is really tacky

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.040
Grant: Wow it's like putty.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.960
Grant: That is unexpectedly awesome

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.340
Derek: You can tell it's got some viscosity now.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.840
Grant: So this makes me wonder
like what would happen if we did put the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.440
lid in there and run it for a bit longer.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.320
We're back in business. Ready?

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.820
Grant: This thing is now just become multi-multi-purpose: aluminum, copper, brass, gold, glass. What else?

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.980
Derek: So now you gotta do some glass-blowing experiments on your channel?

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.320
Are you going to try to make a glass blown object 
Grant: That's a great idea.
Derek: I'm going to challenge you to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.000
Grant: Glass-blowing, coming up on the King of Random Cooking Channel

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.620
Derek: That would be pretty random.
Grant: So we're going to let this thing set for about another

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.289
five to ten minutes we're going to see
what happens when we leave the glass in

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:56.080
there with the lid in place - how much can we decrease the viscosity.
Derek: It's going to be a gooey mess when we open that thing, man

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.490
Grant: I think so 
So obviously when we get glass hot enough

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.639
it resembles a liquid I mean obviously
it is liquid, it flows right but

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.210
what about glass in its solid state 
Derek: At room temperature a lot of people say

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.710
that it is a liquid one of the reasons
for that is because glass is something

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.719
called an amorphous solid which means
that the actual molecules don't line up

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.409
like when you get ice right all the
water molecules actually lock into this

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:23.219
crystalline structure and it's a
particular shape but in glass they stay

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:26.339
really kind of disorganized 
Grant: That's really interesting so what you're saying is

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.930
even glass panes those window panes on a
house a hundred years later can still

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.000
actually be flowing 
Derek: Well, about that, I think I made a video about this you can

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.649
go check it out on my channel is glass
actually a liquid at room temperature

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:42.930
Grant: So we'll put a link down in the description
is glass really a liquid at room

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.419
temperature you can go find out on the Veritasium channel, in the meantime

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.969
let's get back to our foundry and see
how its reacted now that we've had the

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:49.260
lid on for the last ten minutes

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.279
I can actually see it, yeah it looks like...

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.740
I don't know how to describe it almost
looks like whipping cream, you can see

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.540
the different layers but it is completely melted down and it's all at the bottom of the crucible right now.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.459
Derek: What are we going to do with it?
Grant: That's a great question

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.160
Derek: Do you want me to get something?
Grant: Now that we've melted this glass, what on Earth are we going to do with it?

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.480
Why don't we get like something like a cookie sheet or a casserole tray...

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.700
Derek: I'm going to get something, bring it out

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.680
Grant: Put some dirt on it we'll see if we can make a very crude mold just for proof of concept.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.360
all right guys it is time
Mr. Lid-Remover

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.840
Grant: Look at that!
Derek: That is serious.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.800
Grant: It's a glass soup.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.080
Grant: Do you see that?
I'd say that's molten.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.720
Derek: Absolutely, that is glass liquid. Absolutely.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.460
Grant: Yeah, I love how liquid that is, that's amazing
I'd say it has the consistency of

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.900
like a melted caramel (KAIR-ah-məl), melted caramel (KAR-məl)
Derek: Yeah

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.980
So we got a little bit of dirt, we added some moisture, we're just

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.730
going to use this glass bottle to make an impression and just do a really crude

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.490
casting just as a proof of concept. See if it even works.
Derek: This is really meta. Right, we have melted

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.520
down a Dr. Pepper bottle and now we're trying to cast it back into the shape

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.740
of a Dr. Pepper bottle. Take that!

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.440
Grant: There we go, glass is looking liquid. We
know from experience we can't just pour

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.190
this thing in so we're just going to try
turning the whole thing over on some

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:39.370
cinder blocks and letting it do its thing
like that. It moves so slowly I wouldn't

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.470
be surprised if it like solidified before it-
Derek: If it freezes as it's coming down

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.580
Derek: Come on, man.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.680
Grant: That stuff's going to be really difficult to get out of that crucible
Derek: No kidding

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:58.580
Grant: Is it? (Oh! Look at it go!) Oh, look at that, look at that! Is it going to hit the mold or is it off a little bit?

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.560
Derek: It's off, it's a little bit off but it'll get down. Yeah. (Here we go) Nice, nice.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.860
Grant: It's cooling down fast though, isn't it? It looks like lava.
Derek: It does, you can see that it's still

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:14.110
glowing right there's still-
Grant: Oh man. Oh! We have contact, but yeah look how fast

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.140
it's cooling down.
Derek: Wonder if we can like pull it out of there a little faster

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.260
Grant: It's already solidified (Whoa) Look at that.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:31.500
Grant: Huh. Oh, it's still going. It's like cheesy pizza.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:40.760
Derek: Up above, it's still hot, I can see it coming down in hot pieces
Grant: Now it's solidifying into like hard candy-equivalent

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.960
Derek: This is cool
Grant: Feel the heat radiating off that crucible - toasty!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.980
Okay I'm going to put this crucible over
and see what's left inside now that

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:59.960
nothing else is coming out. 
I'm just going to take this here, flip it around (Oh wow)

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.800
We've almost made like a little
improvised glass bowl in there

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.420
Oh there's a little molten aluminum peeking out down there

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.340
What's amazing is how quickly this cools - oh wow

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.280
Oh, there goes!
Oh... clean-up on aisle three

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.320
Let's go ahead and move this back and
take a look at what kind of a casting we got

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.840
Grant: Hahahaha that is terrible
Derek: It's not much of a casting

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.760
I mean, can you melt glass - yes.
Can you cast it - not yet.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.760
Grant: Not really.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.940
I'm gonna grab this, oops it's brittle

00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:01.500
Derek: It did start to conform a little bit on the bottom sides - the shape - but it wasn't - couldn't stay hot long enough

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.240
Derek: (yeah) I feel like if you could cast it almost like within (oh yeah) another foundry
Grant: And if you had your mold preheated as well

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.700
Derek: Oh yeah
Grant: That would help a lot

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.000
I mean so I think as a result of what we saw today

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.870
you can definitely melt glass in this
foundry so you can't necessarily cast

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.330
it very well, not yet
Grant: No that's going to take a much more

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.810
professional setup than we've played
with here, but proof of concept here guys

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.500
we can actually liquefy glass to the
point where we'll it will drip into

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.980
whatever mold we want to, the problem it that it just cools down too much before it's-
Derek: Yeah, you have to keep it hot

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:35.630
Grant: It's very cool. So there you have it guys, we started this experiment for the

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.780
purpose to see if the metal foundry
would melt glass and we found that it did

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.680
Not only did it - it did a lot faster than
we were expecting and got it to a very

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.020
"less viscous" consistency?
Derek: Yeah, that's right it was flowing quite - quite rapidly

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.860
except when we try to get it out, tried to
pour it into that mold, then it cooled

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.370
down quite rapidly as well so we
couldn't quite make a mold out of it

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.820
Grant: That's what we noticed, as hot as the
glass was, it still only took a few

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.480
seconds for it to cool down and solidify. We
could pull strands with it, we could make

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.540
really weird-looking sculptures with it
I don't know how we're going to clean up

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.240
this crucible now
Derek: I think you're going to have to like chip it off

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.880
Grant: I think that is going to be a terrible mess but
anyway we didn't have a lot of fun doing

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.700
it we're so glad you could join us here
make sure you go check out Derek with

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.700
Veritasium he has got a lot of
intellectual content a lot of things

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.190
