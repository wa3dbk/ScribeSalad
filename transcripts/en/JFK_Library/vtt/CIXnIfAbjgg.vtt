He was awarded the
2016 Nobel Peace Prize

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.360
for what the prize committee
described as quote,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.860
his resolute efforts to bring
the country's more than 50 year

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.860
long civil war to an end.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.210
He is currently the Angelopoulos
Global Public Leaders Fellow

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.310
at the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.630

first foreign trade minister.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
And also served as finance
minister and national defense

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.180
minister.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.060
He created the good
government foundation,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.580
Fundición Buen Gobierno.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.280

was awarded the King of
Spain prize for journalism.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.930
He was also elected president

commission for the
inter-american press

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.340

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.660
I'm also delighted to introduce
our moderator for this evening.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.140
Ricardo Hausmann is
director of Harvard's center

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.030

Previously, he served as
the first chief economist

of the inter-american
development bank,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.310
where he created the

international finance,
and the social dimensions

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.770

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.743
Please join me in welcoming
our special guest this evening.

00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:04.701
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.310
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Good
evening, good evening.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.790
And thank you for coming to this
a conversation with President

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.110
Santos.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.960
I first met President
Santos when he was minister

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.610
of foreign trade of Colombia.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.020
And I was minister of planning.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.190
He then went on to become
minister of finance

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.770
when I was the chief economist
at the inter-american

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.700
development bank.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.000
Then he went on to become
minister of defense.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.550
In between, he created a
foundation on good governance.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.240
After being minister
of defense, he

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.855
became president of Colombia.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.820
When we first met, there
were many Colombians

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.980
migrating towards Venezuela.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.090
Because we had a higher
standard of living,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.270
better living
conditions, and so on.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.820
These days, Venezuelans
are massively

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.010
going towards Colombia.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.470
Now, obviously, that is
in part due to some things

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.390
that we did wrong in Venezuela.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.450
But the fact that they're
going to Colombia,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.130
is an indication that you did
something right in Colombia.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.980
So with that perspective of
the last say, 27 years or so,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.380
what went right in Colombia?

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.880
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well, first
of all, thank you very much.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.770
I'm very honored to be here.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.260
It's a marvelous place.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.010
Inspiring place.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.320
Inspired by a great
President, John Kennedy.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.430
And thank you, Ricardo,
for being my companion

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.440
in this conversation.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.720
Colombia, in the last years,
has had a very positive

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.810
transformation.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.490
Well, we've been doing sort of
a set of reforms since we met.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.590
When I was minister
of trade, that's

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.960
when Venezuela and Colombia
opened their economies.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.360
We were very close economies.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.800
But then-- I'll go back to
2010 when I became president--

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.280
we started the peace process.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.490
We can talk about that later on.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:43.320
But at the same time, we wanted
to make a series of reforms.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.960
I had the idea of
something similar to what

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.670
President Kennedy and then
President Johnson did.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.070
In terms of the
social investment,

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.420
the Civil Rights Act.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:07.640
And we started to have Congress
pass reforms, approve reforms,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.600
which were very important.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.530
For example, in the
last eight years

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.560
we made access to our health
system a fundamental right.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.040
And we now have
universal coverage.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:29.570
We made education free for
every boy and girl in Colombia,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.600
from kindergarten
to the 11th grade.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.130
And we increased, substantially,
the access to higher education.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.740
And for the first time, we put
education on top of our budget.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.380
Usually, for the last 100
years, defense and security

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.110
were the number one.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.180
Well, we changed that.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.050
We put education as number one.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.560
We made a very ambitious
program for modernizing

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.770
our infrastructure.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:09.440
And we have, right now,
in place a real revolution

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.395
in terms of modernizing
our highways, our ports.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.200
Last time we went to
Bogota, you arrived

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.840
to the airport, which is
the most modern airport

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.610
in the whole of Latin America.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.560
Number one in cargo.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.940
Number three in passengers
after Mexico and Sao Paolo.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.400
And we put in
place some programs

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.430
that allowed us to
improve substantially,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.810
our social indicators.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:51.270
For example, our
fight against poverty.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.310
And we innovated there.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:01.660
I had a professor in
Harvard who won the Nobel

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.700
Prize in economics.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.480
He comes from
India, Amartya Sen,

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:14.390
who had a very different
idea of measuring progress,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.620
measuring prosperity.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.720
Very similar-- I brought
a part of his speech--

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.220
very similar to what Robert
Kennedy had at that time.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:36.280
I went to the University
of Kansas in 1969.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.700
In March of 1968, Robert Kennedy
went to University of Kansas.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.280
And I have here,
part of his speech.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.150
I want to read it to you,
because it's very inspiring.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:57.580
He said, even if we act
to erase material poverty,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.370
there is another greater task.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.950
It is to confront poverty
of satisfaction, purpose,

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.700
and dignity that
afflicts us all.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.180
Too much for too long, we
seem to have surrendered

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.710
personal excellence
and community

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:20.770
values in the mere accumulation
of material things.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.480
Our gross national product now
is over $800 billion a year.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.610
But that gross
national product--

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.670
if we judge the United
States of America by that--

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.180
that gross national product
counts air pollution

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.680
and cigarette advertising.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.730
And ambulances to clear
our highways of carnage.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.060
It counts special
locks for our doors.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.580
And the jails for the
people who break them.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.940
It counts the destruction
of the Redwood.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:54.830
And the loss of our natural
wonder in chaotic sprawl.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.330
It counts napalm.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.360
And counts nuclear
warheads in armored cars

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.270
for the police to fight
the riots in our cities.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:07.040
It counts Whitman's
rifle and Speck's knife.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.670
And the television programs
which glorify violence in order

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.610
to sell toys to our children.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.940
Yet, the gross national
product does not

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.270
allow for the health
of our children,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.650
the quality of their education
or the joy of their play.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.650
It does not include the
beauty of our poetry.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.960
Or the strength
of our marriages.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.580
The intelligence of our
public debate or the integrity

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.370
of our public officials.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.590
It measures neither our
whit nor our courage.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.070
Neither our wisdom
nor our learning.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.580
Neither our compassion nor
our devotion to our country.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.100
It measures everything
in short, except that

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.360
which makes life worthwhile.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.650
And it can tell us everything
about America except why we are

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.930
proud that we are Americans.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:18.440
That was very similar of what
Professor Sen was teaching.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.900
And so I called him.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.580
And I said,
professor Sen, I want

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.730
to apply your theory
in my country.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.960
And he said, OK, come to Oxford.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.530
I took the presidential
plane and flew to Oxford.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.590
And he set up a
group of his advisors

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.810
and his people who
worked with him.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.270
Went back to Columbia,
and we established

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.610
something called a
multidimensional poverty index.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.060
And we approved
laws in Congress.

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.020
And made reforms.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.940
And created the institutions.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.910
And started fighting
poverty, measuring

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:05.150
these type of basic
necessities that people

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.570
needed to be satisfied.

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:14.060
And that allowed us to
invest our social expenditure

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.860
with a much higher
return socially.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.830
And that's why Colombia,
in relative terms,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.990
had brought down poverty.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.430
And extreme poverty.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.620
And inequality,
which is a problem

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:32.330
for all of Latin America,
more than other countries

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.720
in our region.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.740
So in all of this, we have
tried to do with what we call,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.990
fiscal responsibility.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.320
You know better
than me and anybody

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.660
because your
economics professor,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.680
how to maintain the
confidence in your economy.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.250
And maintain the
confidence of investors.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.800
In order to be
able to grow, it's

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.600
one of the necessary conditions.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:09.080
So, to summarize, Colombia
has had a responsible

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.040
macroeconomic policy.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.840
And at the same time, a very
aggressive social policy.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:21.590
That has allowed us to perform
much better than Venezuela.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.800
I will tell you an anecdote,
which comes to the point

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.960
that you were asking.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.990
I was a very harsh
critic of Chávez.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.770
And when I got elected, he
even told my predecessor

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.150
that if I got elected, there
would be war with Colombia.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.510
Well, when I got
elected, I decided

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.300
to try to make peace
with our neighbors.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.180
Because we didn't
have at that time

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:54.230
diplomatic relations with
Venezuela or Ecuador.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.800
We had very bad
relations with Brazil.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.930
No trade relations.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:05.240
And so I made peace with Chávez.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:15.560
And I told him, let's do what
President Reagan told Gorbachev

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.110
when they met in Geneva.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.180
And when President
Reagan told Gorbachev,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.400
I will never be a communist
and you will never

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.420
become a capitalist,
but let's work together

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.820
for a superior objective.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.880
Which is, at that
that conversation,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.760
to reduce the nuclear arsenal.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.070
And I said to Chávez., I will
never become a Bolivarian

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:41.030
revolutionary.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.330
And you will never become
a liberal Democrat.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.780
But let's work
together for peace.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.780
Peace in Colombia, which
is also peace in Venezuela.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.030
And peace in the region.

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.300
And he said yes.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.680
And he started criticizing my
economic model, my development

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.180
model.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.230
And I said, hey, let's not
discuss our economic models

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.250
and our development models.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:17.180
Let history judge us
some years from now.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.670
Well, I think history has made
a very, very important judgment

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.300
comparing Venezuela to Colombia.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.300
People are coming to
Colombia not only because

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.450
of the terrible situation
that unfortunately, you're

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.171
going through, the Venezuelans.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:41.940
But also because Colombia
is now offering them

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.910
what Venezuela offered
us for many, many years.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.980
A better future, freedom.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.830
Democracy with all
its problems, but we

00:15:55.830 --> 00:16:02.220
have a democracy that we have to
strive to strengthen every day.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.090
And that's what we're trying
to recover in Venezuela.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:11.970
Because unfortunately, Maduro
did away with democracy.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:17.210
And that's why we have
to all keep the pressure,

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:24.820
to see if we can put Venezuela
again, in the democratic path.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.150
Venezuela is a
very rich country.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.880
A great country,
with great people.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.250
And they don't
deserve what they're

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.873
going through at this time.

00:16:33.873 --> 00:16:35.040
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Thank you.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:39.600
Let me ask you, if you
were to in your hat,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.620
not just as former president,
but a former minister

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.180
of finance and so on.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.730
What were, if you say,
a lesson of history?

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.180
Do this topic this
way, like Colombia.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.170
And not this way,
like Venezuela.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.010
What were the mistakes that
were done in Venezuela?

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.227
And the correct policies
that were done in Colombia?

00:17:01.227 --> 00:17:02.310
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well--

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.518
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Name a few.

00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:10.440
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: In Colombia,
we applied what some of us

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.569
call, the third way.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:20.109
And that's what I would say Bill
Clinton did here, in the US.

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.440
What Tony Blair did in the UK.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.780
What Fernando Henrique
Cardoso did in Brazil.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.500
Or Ricardo Lagos in Chile.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.050
You summarize the third
way in a phrase that

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:39.450
says, more or less, that you
allow the markets to perform

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.770
until they are able to perform.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.050
But you intervene.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.520
The state intervenes
when it's necessary.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:53.560
To correct whatever
markets are not doing,

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.800
or when then the
markets do not work.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:04.090
And this pragmatic combination
has allowed the countries

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:11.590
that have applied this third way
to have a period of prosperity

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.710
that is much more important
than other periods

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.830
in their economic history.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:23.580
In Venezuela, the approach
was completely different.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.820
The state has to do everything.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.550
The state has to
control everything.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.920
And not only in economic
terms, in political terms.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.680
So, freedom-- which is,
for me, a sacred word--

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.240
was sacrificed in Venezuela.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.180
And when you sacrifice
freedom, and you

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:49.160
don't allow the private
initiative and innovation

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:55.310
and the good ideas
to flourish, you

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.750
will simply destroy
whatever you have.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.090
And this is what has
happened in Venezuela.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:08.700
Plus, if you allow
corruption to take over,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.480
well, then you
make things worse.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.130
And unfortunately, Venezuela,
they also allowed corruption.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:23.200
To take over a system that
was doomed from the beginning

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.287
because they were
on the wrong track.

00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:29.370
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Very
interesting, let's move on,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.160
now.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.880
You've got the Nobel
Prize for peace.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:39.070
So before we talk about
peace, let's talk about war.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.230
Colombia had a civil war
that was 50 some years long.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.850
What, in your mind, was
the cause of the war?

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:55.030
And maybe not just the
cause of the war, but what

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.710
made it so long lasting?

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:00.250
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Well, Colombia

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.300
has been a very violent
country since our independence.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.600
We have had more civil
wars than any other country

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.440
in Latin America.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:15.240
This specific war
with the FARC started

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.310
in the early '60s,
when two things were

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:22.290
present at same time.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:28.560
In the early '60s you had all
these revolutionary movements.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.570
The Cuban revolution and
the communist revolutions.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.520
And so you had the guerrilla
movements, not only in

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.580
Colombia and also Venezuela.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:44.040
And in many countries.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:51.350
But in Colombia, after our
only military dictatorship--

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.660
that in order to topple
this dictatorship

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.950
that fortunately lasted very,
very short amount of time--

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:03.380
the two main political parties
decided to share power.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.600
And share everything.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.310
And half of the cabinet it was
liberal, half of the cabinet

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.610
was conservative.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.120
All the positions the
government, half and half.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.050
And they excluded
everybody else.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:23.820
So the revolutionary
movements plus the exclusion

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:28.050
of what we called at that
time the National Front,

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:37.020
gave the correct environment
for the FARC to flourish.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:42.900
And also we neglected
for many, many years,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.950
and we still are neglecting, the
development in the rural areas.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.560
And this was a rural
guerrilla, a peasant guerrilla.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:22:01.180
And when the guerrilla
movement started to fade away,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.170
or to win in other countries.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:10.580
And in Colombia,
unfortunately, something

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:16.310
arrived that has been a
terrible problem for us,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:19.280
terrible headache, which
is drug trafficking.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:29.200
So the FARC discovered a golden
head of the drug trafficking

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.540
to finance the war.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.160
So that gave them
an extra muscle.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.580
And so they were able
to last 50 years.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:46.780
And their idea was a
communist revolution.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.780
And their flag was
social justice.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.360
That's the origin.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.550
From there, they
started to evolve.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.650
Unfortunately, they got
into drug trafficking.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.110
And so their ideals
were starting to change.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.770
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
So before we go

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.320
on to the continuation
of war and peace,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.140
maybe you could tell us a
little bit your thoughts

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:28.700
about to what extent, in this
World War on drugs, that caused

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.480
so much havoc in Colombia.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.265
Any thoughts on was this the
right way to face the drug

00:23:36.265 --> 00:23:36.765
issue?

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.320
If you have any
comments on, was it

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.010
inevitable that it should
have proceeded that way?

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.250
Or were there other
ways in which,

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.690
if you are now to
act on drug policy,

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.030
what would your drug policy be?

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.690
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well I
will tell you an anecdote.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:08.070
I am a very, very keen
reader of biographies.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.270
The latest biography
of Winston Churchill--

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.650
it's a bit long it's a
bit over 1,000 pages,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.110
but it's the best one--

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:24.670
has a story that during
prohibition, Winston Churchill

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:30.220
came to the US through
Canada to California.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:35.090
And he arrived and
he asked for a drink.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:40.130
And they said, no
Mr. Churchill, drink

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:43.280
is prohibited in this country.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.720
And he said, what a
strange country this is.

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:56.970
You allow the huge profits
of the sale of liquor

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.720
to go to the mafias.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.110
In my country, we give
it to the treasury.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.640
RICARDO HAUSMANN: [LAUGHING]

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:11.270
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: That's
why it's interesting.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.320
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Now, you
have this guerrilla movement.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.100
It's there, it's outside of
the constitutional rules.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.460
I mean, you change the
Constitution in 1991,

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.130
I believe.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:33.270
You know, that system that
justified the creation

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.280
of the guerrilla was change.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.230
You became a more open
democracy and so on.

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.950
But the guerrillas continued.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.865
So here, you are they appoint
you minister of defense.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:51.230
What's your strategy, how
do you deal with them?

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.690
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Well, I go back.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.990
I was seeing them and they
were showing me around

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:02.550
and how President
Kennedy was a sailor.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.120
And I was in the Navy, also.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.700
And I learned in the
Navy, how to sail.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.890
And the first lesson
that they gave me,

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.920
the officer that
was in charge said,

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.970
Santos, he gave
a small sailboat,

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.300
go and learn how to sail.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.880
And that was very difficult.
I didn't know what to do

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.180
and I really got problems.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.150
And he said, I'll
teach you something

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:35.240
which is going to be
very important to you.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.250
Not only to learn how to
sail, but in your life.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.090
In everything that has
to do with your future.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.950
You always need to know
where you want to go.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.510
And in sailing, if you have,
like, a port of destination,

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.070
you can use all the winds.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.490
No matter how strong they are
or if they're against you,

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:04.160
you can use them to arrive
to that port of destination.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:09.200
That was a very good lesson
that many, many years later

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.230
in a conversation, I
had with Nelson Mandela.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.010
I was the chairman of the
UNCTAD, United Nations

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.690
Conference on Trade
and Development.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.400
And he got elected
chairman after me.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:28.550
So I went to Johannesburg,
and I gave him the chair.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:31.820
That morning, I was in
the hotel in Johannesburg

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.310
and I turned on the television.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:40.550
And I saw the most
incredible life program.

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.920
There were the victims of the
war with the perpetrators,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.130
live in television,
confronting each other.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:54.080
Some of them embraced, others
screamed at each other.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.240
And I couldn't understand.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.440
And I had a 15 minute
meeting with Mandela program

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.570
that afternoon.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.480
I went and I asked
him, what is it

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.940
that I was seeing this
morning on television?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.400
And that 15 minutes became
five hours of conversation

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.040
about peace.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.170
And at the end he
said, your country

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:23.620
will never progress if
you don't end the war.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.440
And then I discovered
at that time,

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.930
that that was going to be
my port of destination.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.850
That was early '90s.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.130
So, when I became
minister of defense,

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:41.450
I already knew that
we needed peace.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:46.360
But to have a successful
peace process,

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.990
you need to have the right
conditions, the necessary

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.610
conditions.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.580
And one of them was
to weaken the FARC.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.630
To convince them that
through violence,

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.610
they will never achieve
their objective.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.290
They will never win.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:08.230
And so you have to be
successful militarily

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.870
in order to take them to
the negotiating table.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:15.940
And so when I arrived, when
I was appointed minister

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.900
of defense, I knew that
I had to be successful

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.090
if I wanted to take them
to the negotiating table.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:28.910
So I had to become a
very effective hawk.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.600
And I was elected
president in the year 2010

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.790
because I was a war hero.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:39.890
And when you were
a war hero, you

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.310
exercise a very easy
type of leadership.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.100
In times of war,
you give orders.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.510
And you rally the
forces around you.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.890
And you point at the
enemy, your adversaries,

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:02.490
and you say, let's go
together against our enemies.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.080
That is easy.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.860
But then I have
to become a dove.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.760
And that is much more
difficult. That's

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.380
why I say it's much more
difficult to make peace

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.570
than to make war.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.530
Because to make peace, the type
of leadership is not vertical,

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.030
it's horizontal.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.030
Instead of giving orders,
you have to persuade.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.650
You have to convince the victims
of the war, of the conflict,

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.900
to forgive.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:34.030
And then to tell the
mother of two kids,

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.740
or a daughter that had
been raped and killed,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.570
to forgive the perpetrators,
that is much more difficult.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.740
And to heal the wounds
of 50 years of war

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.540
takes a lot of time.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:55.540
But I always knew
that being effective

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.870
as a minister of defense
was necessary to be

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:03.760
able to sit down and have
a serious negotiation.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:11.200
So when I was
minister of defense,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.510
I also learned a
very important lesson

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:21.050
about how to wage
an effective war.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:27.110
When I came into
the ministry, we

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.110
had copied military strategies.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:35.960
And we had a terrible way of
measuring the effectiveness

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.230
of our officers.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.290
We copied that from Vietnam.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.570
The body count, how
many bodies do you have?

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:51.620
And that's what the generals
and colonels were measured by.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.770
And that is a very bad way
to measure the effectiveness

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:59.780
of a an officer.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:07.210
And one general who had retired,
very intelligent historian,

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.200
when I was recently appointed
as minister of defense.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.860
He said to me,
Mr. Santos, you're

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.120
going to have to wage war.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.480
Lead the war against the FARC.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.680
But don't treat them
as your enemies,

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.010
treat them as your adversaries.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.800
Enemies, you destroy.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:32.580
Your adversaries, you beat.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.580
And you're going to
have to live with them

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.050
for the rest of your life.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:41.970
I know that you want
peace, so treat them

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:47.640
as sons of the same nation.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.290
They are your brothers.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:54.010
Humanize the war.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.820
And that will give
you much more respect.

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:04.330
And will give the military more
respect from the population.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:11.360
Our military were blacklisted
in many of the lists

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.850
in the human rights in
Geneva And New York.

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:20.560
So we've made a radical change.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.570
And for example, instead of
a body count, I start saying,

00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:29.800
I will measure your
performance by the number

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.680
of guerrillas that give up.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.240
Give their arms.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.360
That reincorporate
into civil society.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:44.520
And we did some very audacious
programs, put in place

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.140
with very audacious policies.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:55.200
Like, for example, we identified
the mothers and the fathers

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.640
of many of the guerrillas.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.310
And asked them to
write a message

00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:03.570
to their sons or daughters.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:10.320
And we put these
messages in some balls

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.960
that floated in the rivers.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.530
That flowed down to where the
guerrillas were concentrated,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.480
in the Amazon jungle.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.489
And this became for them,
a tremendous incentive

00:34:23.489 --> 00:34:26.610
to go and see if their
mother or their father

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.320
had sent them a message.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.300
And afterwards, when I
negotiated with them,

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.250
after the peace
process, they said,

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:37.860
you cannot imagine how it
was much harder for us,

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:40.889
as commanders.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:45.030
The morale of our people, what
you did with these messages.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:51.179
And we also put some lights
in the trees in the jungle

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:52.739
during Christmas.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.199
With messages from
the fathers, mothers

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.150
or, sisters of the guerrillas.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:59.640
And we left, and then
the guerrillas came

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:04.830
and they all competed to
see who had the message.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:11.760
And the effect on the war,
of humanizing the war,

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.050
was much higher.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:22.870
Had a much bigger impact
than bombing the camps

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.330
and killing everybody.

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.220
So that is a human
way to win a war.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:34.580
And that allowed me,
afterwards, to sit down

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:40.650
in a much better environment
to negotiate peace.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.660
RICARDO HAUSMANN: So
when did you decide

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.291
to move from war to peace?

00:35:48.291 --> 00:35:50.333
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: When
I got elected president.

00:35:53.510 --> 00:36:04.070
Because I had identified the
conditions that were necessary.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:10.610
I used a lot of the lessons
that I learned here, at Harvard.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.300
Negotiation lessons, the
first lessons I took,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.830
was from a professor
called Roger Fisher.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:23.040
One of his pupils,
William Murray,

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.520
I brought in as a special
advisor for the negotiations

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.887
since the very beginning.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:40.780
And I also used the lessons of
a marvelous professor, whose

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:45.130
100th anniversary was
just recently celebrated,

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.900
Richard Newstead.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.780
Vise President Gore was
there in the celebration

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.120
of his 100th anniversary.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.290
And I studied all
the peace processes

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.780
that have been negotiated.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:04.840
What was applicable to our
process, and what was not.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.000
What lessons could we learn?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.550
And so, in that
process, I discovered

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.850
a series of conditions
that were necessary.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:17.260
And one of them was
that in today's world,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:22.330
asymmetrical wars need
the support of the region.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:26.090
And if possible, of the
international community.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:31.360
We were going to negotiate peace
under the umbrella of the Rome

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.300
statute, which is an
international treaty that

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.620
was negotiated to
facilitate negotiations.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.400
And those conditions
were not present

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.660
until I became president.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.880
When I made peace, for
example, with Chávez.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.030
Or with Korea, in order
to be able to have

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.970
the necessary conditions to
have a successful peace process.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:00.970
So I switched from hawk to
dove when I became president.

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.360
RICARDO HAUSMANN: And so
tell us a little bit more.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.450
So you decided to
go to a negotiation.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:14.140
What was your
initial strategy, how

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.020
did you conceive of the
negotiating process?

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.520
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
In this process,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.080
of learning from
other processes.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:26.530
And all my predecessors had
tried to make peace since 1882.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:30.370
All the presidents of Colombia
had tried and had failed.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:37.240
So I started to study why had
they failed, what was lacking.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:42.700
The first thing that I learned,
not only from our own failures,

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.500
but from other peace
processes, that you

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:51.750
need a very short
and concrete agenda.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:57.320
I learned that the less
public your negotiations,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.430
especially at the
beginning, the better.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:06.130
So we negotiated secretly
for two years, the agenda.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.110
And until we had the agenda,
which is of almost 50%

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.100
of negotiations, defined,
then we went public.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:19.170
We went to Oslo and
made the agenda public.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:25.070
I learned that the military
were very important to be

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.390
part of the process.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.420
All my predecessors thought
that the military would

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:34.990
be spoilers of the process.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:42.310
But I also learned that there's
a very famous phrase of General

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:48.180
MacArthur, said, if you think
that the military like war,

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.320
you don't understand
the military.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.960
The soldiers are the ones
who risked their lives.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.310
They are the most
interested in having peace.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.920
And I know because I
was in the military.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.100
And so I talk their language.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.380
So I brought them in.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:11.740
Two of my chief negotiators were
the two most popular generals

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.160
that Colombia had,
police and army.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:23.000
And so all these conditions
could not be sort of created

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.680
until I was president.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.180
That's why the switch was
made when I became president.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:33.970
Two years of secret
negotiations and then we

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.240
start the public negotiations.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.890
Another very difficult
decision that I took

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:49.750
was, because during the
Ministry of Defense,

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.930
we had been able to
get the upper hand

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.780
in the military balance of
power with the guerrillas.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.720
Because the
guerrillas had always

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.440
taken advantage of
the negotiations

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.390
to increase their military
and their political power.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:15.270
I studied the peace processes
in Israel and Palestine.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.590
And I remembered a strategy
that Prime Minister

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:25.640
Rabin, from Israel, had applied
when he sat down with Arafat.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:33.100
And he said, I will
negotiate with terrorism,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:39.720
which was Arafat, as if
there is no terrorism.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:42.630
But I will continue
to fight terrorism as

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.120
if there is no peace process.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.120
So I told the FARC, I'm going
to apply the same doctrine.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.330
We will sit down and negotiate,
but we continue the war.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:57.420
They wanted a
ceasefire, but I did not

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.640
want a ceasefire until I knew
that we could get an agreement.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.350
It's very risky.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.740
It brought me a lot of
problems because people

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.580
don't understand.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.270
Why are you talking
to these people

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.310
while they committed
all these atrocities?

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:18.600
But in the long run, it's
the most effective way

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.240
to get a result.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.310
RICARDO HAUSMANN: What
was your initial thoughts

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.910
of what you were going to find
in the FARC in the negotiation?

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:29.620
And what did you
learn about the FARC

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.115
through the negotiation process?

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:41.880
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
They, in a way,

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.040
were getting older,
the grinders.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:48.570
And another condition
that was necessary

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:52.050
was to convince the
commanders that it's

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:58.240
in their own personal
advantage to negotiate, and not

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.280
to continue the war.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.500
When I became minister of
defense, 45 years of war,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:09.280
and not one single
member of what they call,

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.670
the secretariat, like,
the board of directors,

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.170
had been captured or killed.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.240
Not one single one, in 45 years.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.790
They had penetrated all
our intelligence agencies.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:28.980
So I went to a
friend of mine, which

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:32.040
was the prime minister of
Great Britain at that time.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.500
And I told him, please help me.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.130
And he said, what do you need?

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.060
I said, I need you
to help me in what

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.410
you are the best in the
world, intelligence.

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:50.640
So he got the phone
and dialed the phone

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.900
number of a marvelous man
called Sir John Scarlett.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.740
He was the head of MI6,
British intelligence.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:03.090
He said, I have a friend of
mine, I want you to help him.

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:09.435
I went in his building, it's
a building with no address.

00:44:09.435 --> 00:44:13.020
And I had a crash course in
intelligence for two days.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.600
Incredible crash
course that said,

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.880
you need to change
your intelligence.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:22.710
You need to change the way
the intelligence operates.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.580
Your intelligence is
modeled by the Americans.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:30.150
The Americans have
their agencies compete.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.200
FBI against the CIA
against the DEA.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.890
They all compete.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:36.060
That won't work in Colombia.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:40.170
That doesn't work in Colombia
because your intelligence is

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.670
made by the different forces.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.790
And they are military
or police, and they

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.070
don't have the flexibility.

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:49.950
You have to have a
system like we have,

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.370
concentrated under the
Office of the Prime Minister.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.830
This case, on the
office of the president.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.510
This change made
our intelligence

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.010
much more effective.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:08.400
And we started the
taking down what we call,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.610
the high value targets.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.480
And I had to make very
difficult decisions.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:24.540
For example, one day I was
having dinner with I remember,

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.940
the board of directors of
Conservation International

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.720
Environmental, NGO.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:36.510
And the commander of the
Army called me and said,

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:44.870
we have located the number one
person in FARC, the commander.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:50.120
We've been going after him
for 40 years or 30 years.

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.640
And I had to take a decision.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.210
I had already started
the peace process.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.430
But the rules of the
game were Rabin doctrine.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.820
So I had to take the
decision right there.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.550
Do I authorize an
operation against him?

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:13.220
This could simply erase
the peace process forever.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:18.890
Or a do I withhold, and tell
the military now, you know,

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.360
you can't go after him?

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.070
Which could mean
that the military

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.260
would be very frustrated.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:33.550
And their support for the peace
process would be weakened.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.166
Well, I took the decision
to authorize the operation.

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:45.130
Because I had told the FARC,
it is legitimate for you

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.500
to want to kill me.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.070
In those words, it
is legitimate for me

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.540
to go to the war against you.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.830
And they had accepted.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.080
So I said, go after him.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.945
He was killed.

00:46:57.945 --> 00:47:01.170
And afterwards.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:06.320
The FARC told me,
it hurt us a lot.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.840
You're an SOB.

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.690
But we respect you for that.

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:18.670
And that helped the trust that
was necessary, in their case,

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:24.160
to be built in order to be
able to get an agreement.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:34.000
I learned that also,
like humanizing the war,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.290
also humanizes your adversaries.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:42.690
So they're human beings
with son, with the families.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:48.100
And that allows you to start
speaking a different language,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.530
with a different attitude.

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.470
Of course, we were
miles apart in the way

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.740
we thought about the
future of the country.

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:02.710
But slowly, I realized that
what they were asking for

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:10.490
was not that important, if
you weighed the concessions.

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:15.710
They wanted to have a
representation in Congress.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:22.940
They wanted to be
forgiven for their crimes.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.830
And I said, the base would
be forgiven, not the leaders.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:29.870
The leaders will be judged,
sentenced, and condemned.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.090
There will be no impunity.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:36.170
Because the Rome statute
will not allow the impunity.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:43.030
They wanted to have some
reforms in the rural areas, that

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.500
were exactly the same that
were needed for the country.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.200
So I said, OK
that, I can accept.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:54.130
So I discovered
that there was not

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.370
huge differences in what
their expectations were,

00:48:57.370 --> 00:48:58.660
and what we could give.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:04.520
And that facilitated
the negotiations a lot.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.130
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Why
did it take so long?

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.690
How long did it take?

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:12.110
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: It took
six years of negotiations.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.920
And this a very good question.

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:21.972
When people ask me, what would
you have done differently?

00:49:21.972 --> 00:49:23.930
One of the things I would
have done differently

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:30.170
is, we negotiated five
points in the agenda.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:35.300
And we decided to
negotiate in a sequence.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.670
We have to agree
on the first point

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:42.710
to go to the second point.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:44.280
That was a mistake.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:51.110
We should have negotiated
simultaneously because time,

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:53.990
and that is the lesson that
I learned afterwards, goes

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:57.680
against the government,
not against the guerrillas.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.320
And because everything
that happens

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.680
in the negotiation, will
cost the government,

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:09.320
or the person
representing the state,

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.690
will cost him politically.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:13.730
Especially when
you are negotiating

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.890
in the middle of the war.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:21.440
And that cost me a lot
of my political capital

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.340
because it went on too long.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:26.280
But that's a good question.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.570
They knew that,
and they stalled.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:33.770
And they were slow
in taking decisions.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.538
And there, I would have
done it differently.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.270
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Very good.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:46.010
In this country there, is a
huge debate on health care.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.170
There's, you know,
in this country,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:58.360
most health insurance is
provided by employers.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.160
And then when
people switch jobs,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:03.280
it generates
uncertainty and so on.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.180
It's very expensive.

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.400
It's been on the political
agenda for a long time.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:21.880
Colombia made a major,
major health care reform.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.490
can you tell us--

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.940
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Very
shortly, what we did was,

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:32.850
we passed a constitutional
amendment saying,

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:36.150
access to the health system
is a fundamental right.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.300
No hospital can deny
access to any Colombian

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.630
who goes there sick.

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:46.380
Also, they were a system
that was subsidized,

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.290
and a system that
was by contributions.

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:54.360
We decided to put the
passengers of second class

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.510
as passengers of first class.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:05.740
And we chose the treatments that
were included in the system.

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:11.950
I think we overdid it, our
system is too expensive.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.910
And so we have a
system today that

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.600
measured, by
international standards,

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.810
they have three ways of
measuring the health system.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.290
What percentage of the
population is covered?

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.470
In the case of Columbia,
universal coverage.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.590
How many treatments are
included the system?

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.130
The case of Columbia, very,
very high amount of treatment.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.360
Very large amount of treatments.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.340
And what percentage of the
family income goes to health?

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.830
We have one of the
lowest in the world.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.130
So we are very well
rated, our health system.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:49.830
Of course, we have
terrible problems

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.450
in the quality of the system.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:55.110
We have to prove
that and we might

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:58.030
have to reduce the
number of treatments.

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:03.150
But Ricardo, I think I
am the journalist here.

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:05.580
You're not a
journalist then, right?

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.280
And I think many
people here would

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.280
like to hear about Venezuela.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:15.840
You're from Venezuela, you
are the expert on Venezuela.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.175
Can I ask you some
questions about Venezuela?

00:53:18.175 --> 00:53:19.050
RICARDO HAUSMANN: OK.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.722
[INAUDIBLE] Go ahead.

00:53:21.722 --> 00:53:22.680
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: OK.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:34.150
At this moment, you've
been very much involved

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.860
in the future of
Venezuela, the D-day.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:40.310
Could you give us
a summary of what

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:44.120
you think will be needed
to recover a country that

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.030
has been destroyed?

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.980
In many respects,
institutionally,

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.830
and the productive sector.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.060
What will it take?

00:53:55.060 --> 00:54:02.615
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Well let
me take a short seven hour

00:54:02.615 --> 00:54:03.115
stretch.

00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:04.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.010
I would say, first of all,
the catastrophe in Venezuela

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.540
is really a orders of magnitude.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:18.210
Bigger than anything that we've
seen pretty much anywhere.

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.390
And certainly, nowhere
in this continent.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.815
The US Great Depression,
GDP fell by 29%.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.240
I mean, that was
a historic event.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.880
People think that they
ignore our depression

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.510
because they went through the
great recession of 2008, 2009.

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:43.520
That saw a decline in GDP of 3%.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:45.180
The Great Depression, was 29%.

00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:55.100
Venezuela had two times the
Great Depression by 2018.

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:59.630
Between 2013 and 2014,
it was a collapse

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.690
of twice the Great Depression.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:06.500
And in 2019, the
expectation is that it

00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:09.387
will be a 30% decline in GDP.

00:55:09.387 --> 00:55:10.970
So, it'll be another
Great Depression.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.810
Sort of three great depressions.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:13.310
So--

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:16.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.450
RICARDO HAUSMANN: So--

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:20.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:23.520
RICARDO HAUSMANN: I'll
let you speak afterwards.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.687
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Do you--

00:55:24.687 --> 00:55:26.936
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:33.835 --> 00:55:35.460
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Continue, continue.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.335
RICARDO HAUSMANN: No,
no, you're journalists.

00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:42.240
Anyway, so, the
collapse is enormous.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:47.230
This collapse has
essentially two causes.

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.110
And it's the two things
that we need to fix.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:53.680
The first one is that
Venezuelans have been

00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.500
disempowered from any rights.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:00.400
You were mentioning before,
you have no right to own,

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.270
things can be expropriated
from you with no justification.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:06.890
And mostly, no compensation.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:08.350
You don't have the
right to import.

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:10.090
You don't have the right
to buy foreign exchange.

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:11.715
You don't have the
right to set prices.

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:16.180
Or you don't even have
the right to decide

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:19.870
who you sell things to.

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:23.350
So you have a society that
has been disempowered.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.415
People have needs.

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.040
Some people would
like to make a living

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.380
out of supplying those needs.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.680
They don't have the
rights to do that.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.760
And this all happened
when the price of oil

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.840
was still above 100.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:41.460
So the system was undermining
the basic economy.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.390
The second thing that happened
is that in that period,

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:48.590
where the disempowered society,
they say, well, you know,

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.750
if production declines,
it's not a problem.

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.710
Because we can import.

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.300
And imports went up by a
lot because the price of oil

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:57.820
was high.

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.400
But in addition, they
borrowed enormously.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.670
And they were spending
as if the price of oil

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.120
was at 200, when it was at 100.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.310
So at some point in time,
capital markets said,

00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.470
we don't lend to
this country anymore.

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:13.310
So they couldn't
borrow that amount.

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:15.310
And that's what triggered
the initial recession.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:16.810
And then the price
of oil collapsed.

00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:19.560
So now, there's a shortage
of foreign exchange.

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.910
So there's no raw materials,
no intermediate inputs,

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.320
no spare parts.

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.420
So people cannot produce.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.700
They cannot plant.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:30.730
So there's no seeds, no
fertilizers, no agrochemicals.

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:33.118
There are no spare parts, or
there's no transportation.

00:57:33.118 --> 00:57:33.910
There are no buses.

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:34.630
There are no trucks.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:35.410
There's no cars.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.880
There's no motorcycles.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:37.450
Because--

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:40.990
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Let me
ask you a specific question.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:45.430
Pompeo, the Secretary of
State, was in Cucutan, Colombia

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:46.480
just two days ago.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.397
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Yes.

00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:50.290
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: And he said
the recovery of Venezuela will

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.460
cost about $6-$10 billion.

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.930
You think with $10 billion
you can reconstruct Venezuela?

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:01.270
RICARDO HAUSMANN: I think
he was off by a 0 or so.

00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:03.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:07.300
But if he were right,
if he could do that,

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.460
he would deserve the
Nobel Prize in economics.

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.190
Because he will have
discovered a way

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.020
to solve the
problems of the world

00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.280
for a tenth of their cost.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.160
But it will be
very, very expensive

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.690
to recover the country.

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:22.480
But I sense that there
is a lot of willingness

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.690
to help Venezuela recover.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:26.620
But I--

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.078
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
To what extent?

00:58:28.078 --> 00:58:31.270
And forgive me for
asking this question,

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:34.840
but you're in Venezuela and
you've been very involved.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:44.890
The political use of
the Venezuelan drama

00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:54.220
has been, in a way, a bad
thing for finding a solution.

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.270
What we saw, for example,
with the humanitarian aid.

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:01.840
And both president
of the United States,

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.080
the president of Colombia
using that politically

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:09.000
for their own electorate here.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.472
Do you think that it has
been good or it has been bad?

00:59:12.472 --> 00:59:14.680
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Well, I
think that in this country,

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:19.540
there's broad bipartisan
support for the restoration

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:21.550
of democracy in Venezuela.

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:25.180
And, you know, you've
seen statements

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.490
on both sides of the aisle.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:31.710
So I hope this does not
become partisan in the US.

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:37.240
Because this is really an issue
of democracy and human rights

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:41.930
and freedom and the restoration
of the Constitution.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:48.650
And it's an area where both
Democrats and Republicans share

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:49.610
values.

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:57.020
So I certainly hope
that it remains an issue

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.510
with broad bipartisan support.

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:03.770
I mean, you know, it has
the enthusiastic support

01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:08.420
of prime minister
Trudeau in Canada.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.805
It has broad support of--

01:00:09.805 --> 01:00:11.305
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
All around, yes.

01:00:11.305 --> 01:00:11.880
RICARDO HAUSMANN: All along.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.120
So I think that that broad
coalition is something

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.792
that we need to keep together.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:22.556
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: And
the thing that [AUDIO OUT]

01:00:26.152 --> 01:00:27.610
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
--enough pressure

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:33.340
on the armed forces for them
to return to the Constitution.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:37.450
They are allowing
president Maduro

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.920
to violate the Constitution.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.290
To assert power.

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:45.340
To govern without the
authorization of the National

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.450
Assembly, without any
respect to the Constitution.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.850
They should just go back
to the Constitution.

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:59.960
And you can convince them by
forcing them to repress you.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.210
By putting your people
in danger every day.

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:05.030
To go to the streets to protest.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:10.940
By appealing to their humanity.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:16.940
By negotiating their
future role in society.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.930
But, you know, what you
said about the FARC,

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.150
is that the reason
why they negotiated

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:26.590
is because they
were under threat.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.550
And we don't have
that instrument.

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.410
We cannot threaten them.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:34.290
They are armed,
we are not armed.

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:39.980
So it makes the negotiation
or process difficult.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.350
And you're also unable
to promise them much.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.120
Because they have
nothing to give.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:47.190
And you have no
credibility in being

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:51.100
able to deliver on
any promises you make.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.590
So that's why it's hard, without
international involvement,

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:57.720
to change the situation.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.500
Well now let me get back
to my role as moderator.

01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:14.440
Well, let's start
with an easy one.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.930
My name is Juan David
Gutierres, and I am originally

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:19.840
from Armenia, Colombia.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.610
This is the first
time I verbalize

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:26.330
that I am proud of a Colombian
president because of you.

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:27.940
Thank you for
bringing Colombia back

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.010
to a positive conversation.

01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:34.030
My question relates to the
impact of the peace process.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.370
Historically oppressed and
marginalized communities

01:02:36.370 --> 01:02:37.030
in Colombia.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:41.170
In essence, I'm talking about
Afro Colombian and indigenous

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:43.960
groups, who have certainly
been the most affected

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.370
by the conflict.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:48.915
How to turn these dominant
narratives of hate?

01:02:48.915 --> 01:02:50.540
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Very good question.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:02.380
The peace has two faces,
two sort of trenches.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:06.650
First, is what they call
peace making, which is the one

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.710
that we already delivered.

01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:10.490
We've made peace.

01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.170
We signed the agreement.

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:14.430
The FARC gave up their arms.

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.340
The arms went to the [INAUDIBLE]
nations that were destroyed.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.210
The FARC are now
a political party.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:25.160
And their members are being
re incorporated into society.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.540
The other part is
peace building.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.050
Which is even more
difficult than peacemaking.

01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:37.740
I will tell you an anecdote.

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:43.050
One of my big allies in the
peace process was the pope.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.690
And I used to go visit him.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.000
And I used to tell
him, your holiness,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.160
why don't you go to
Columbia and give me a push?

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.530
I need it.

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.610
And he smiled I said,
I will go to Columbia

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.490
when you will most need me.

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:04.760
And he went to
Columbia's historic visit

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:08.660
after the peace process
had already been signed.

01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.750
After the arms had
been destroyed.

01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:17.600
And he went in a visit
that he, himself,

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:23.230
baptized as, I am going
to Columbia to give

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:25.810
a push to the Colombians.

01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:28.630
To take the first step towards--

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:33.820
and these are the magic
words-- towards reconciliation.

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:39.400
Reconciliation with the victims.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.520
Reconciliation among
Colombians that

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.700
have been hating each
other for so many years.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:51.580
Reconciliation with all those
vulnerable sectors of society

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:55.210
that, because of the
war, had been neglected.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:04:58.780
And even reconciliation
with the environment.

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.910
Because the war has
also terrible effects

01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:05.050
in our biodiversity.

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:07.360
And Colombia is one of
the most when the richest

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.750
countries in the world, in
terms of the environment

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:14.100
and biodiversity.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:21.120
So what is happening, and some
reforms have been approved,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:26.490
is to give these vulnerable
sectors of society

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.830
much more space.

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.580
And guarantee their rights.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.130
For example, the
indigenous people,

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.350
the indigenous communities.

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:45.740
We have been giving them
more autonomy in their health

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.410
systems, in their
education systems.

01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:55.070
And in their special
justice that they apply.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:58.400
And this is a process
that is going on.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:03.080
And now that we have peace,
this should accelerate.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.330
So it's a process
that it started.

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:08.330
And thanks to the
peace process, this

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:11.900
is something that
is now possible.

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.570
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Very good.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.980
And I have a question
here from Juan Miguel.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:21.500
He asks, essentially, why
was Colombia so divided

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.973
about the peace agreement?

01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:27.806
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
That is a good question.

01:06:27.806 --> 01:06:34.340
And peace processes
always have enemies.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.650
I remember President
Clinton telling me

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:52.020
that he mentioned this anecdote
in the funeral of McGuinness,

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:56.520
one of the leaders of the
Northern Ireland peace process,

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.410
that in the middle of the
peace process in South Africa,

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:04.160
Mandela called Clinton.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:10.310
And he said, Mr. President,
they are really destroying me.

01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:13.250
The criticism is very harsh.

01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:17.960
And he said, well,
this is to be expected.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.620
The apartheid people
don't like you.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.900
He said, no, no, no, it's
my own people, the ones that

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.960
are criticizing me.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:36.430
Peace, you have to define,
what is the difficult decision

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:40.930
is, where do you draw the line
between peace and justice?

01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:44.160
And no matter where
you draw it, you

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:49.650
will have people
dissatisfied from both sides.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.500
People who don't
understand the concept

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.910
of transitional justice.

01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:56.400
This is a different
type of justice

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.070
that is applied to
peace processes,

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:04.590
like the Colombians, where
the perpetrators of war crimes

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:06.960
don't go to a normal jail.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.880
They are sanctioned to repair
the rights of the victims.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:15.140
And this is difficult to
understand by many people.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:20.390
Also, many people take
advantage politically

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:24.020
of this dissatisfaction
from both sides.

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:27.140
And I tell you,
there's a professor

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.390
in California called Jared
Diamond who is very well known.

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:34.310
And he went to Columbia.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.870
And he said, I want
to see the president.

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:40.910
And I said, of course.

01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:44.112
And he went and said, Mr.
President, I congratulate you.

01:08:44.112 --> 01:08:44.779
And I said, why?

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:48.229
Because everybody hates you.

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:50.180
And I said, what do you mean?

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.540
And he said, I've been
talking to both sides.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:54.950
Both sides are dissatisfied.

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.500
That means that the
agreement that they made

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.060
is a good agreement.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:03.410
And so it takes time
for people to appreciate

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:05.390
the benefits of peace.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:10.160
And to heal the wounds
that so many years of war

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.098
have produced.

01:09:12.098 --> 01:09:14.390
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Well, it's
been less than a year now.

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:16.000
But is it holding?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.250
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well, yes.

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:24.729
This process is irreversible
Nobody in their right mind

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:28.210
can think that FARC we
go back to the mountain.

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.520
They have surrendered
their arms.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:35.319
They are now reintegrated into
politics and in normal life.

01:09:39.691 --> 01:09:41.649
The problem with the
peace process in Colombia,

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:44.770
it's probably the most
comprehensive peace process

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:46.029
ever negotiated.

01:09:46.029 --> 01:09:50.020
And I don't say this,
all the experts say,

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:56.810
there are two elements
that are very sui generis.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:01.010
Very sophisticated,
transitional, justice system.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:05.570
And it's the first time
that the peace process

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:09.140
agrees on development plans
for all the regions that

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:10.760
were affected by the conflict.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:16.250
Which has 15 years
to be complied with.

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:20.480
People are very anxious that
the road is going to come,

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.420
when the school is
going to be built.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:28.100
And that it is going
to take some time.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:31.220
But the process,
itself, is irreversible.

01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:35.210
And legally, there is
something which people forget.

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:38.030
Our Constitutional
Court made a ruling

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:42.530
that no president, no
Congress, for the next three

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.860
presidential
periods, can approve

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:50.960
a law that will go against the
compliance of the agreement.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.980
RICARDO HAUSMANN: I
have two questions here,

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.550
that have an
international flavor.

01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:00.060
One comes from
Bilbao, Spain where,

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.460
you know the
problems they've had

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.490
with [INAUDIBLE]
nationalist terrorism.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:10.110
Question is this is, it worth
to sacrifice justice for peace?

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:14.480
I would like to hear your
personal point of view.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.800
And so that's the
first question,

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.700
coming from justice
versus peace.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.890
The second one is, you spoke of
defeating FARC and commencing

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.510
a peace process with them.

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:32.390
What advice would you give
to the leaders of Israel?

01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:42.050
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Well, the instructions

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:50.050
I gave my negotiators was, go
and negotiate as much justice

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:54.150
as you can, that will
allow peace to be made.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:03.070
And among the negotiators, there
was an American negotiator.

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:07.720
A professor from the
University of Notre Dame.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:12.550
Name was Douglass Cassel,
expert in human rights.

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:17.250
And his role in the
negotiation was,

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.880
I want to comply with
our own constitution

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.800
and with international law.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.370
So everything that
we negotiated,

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:30.560
from the justice
point of view, is

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.980
a sacrifice for
the people that are

01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:36.440
accustomed to normal justice.

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:42.740
But it's within the range
of the acceptable justice

01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.240
in today's world.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:49.070
The International Criminal
Court was the product

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.130
of the Rome statute.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:52.870
And the International
Criminal Court

01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:59.490
says what we negotiated
is sufficient to guarantee

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.370
that there will be no impunity.

01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.670
Especially for the
most responsible

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:12.240
of war crimes and
crimes against humanity.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:18.108
What advice would I give
the leaders of Israel?

01:13:18.108 --> 01:13:30.980
Well, first, to stop advancing
in those things that are making

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.940
this two state solution viable.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.720
If you continue advancing
with the settlements.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:42.350
If you continue
taking land, like what

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:49.730
is happening with
the Golan Heights,

01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:55.140
make any peace agreement
much more difficult.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.600
I think, like in
any peace agreement,

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.910
you need to sit down.

01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:05.830
And if there is the will, it
should not be that difficult.

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:11.020
Because other
attempts have almost

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.320
defined the two state solution.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.800
If there is the will, I think
that it will be possible.

01:14:20.892 --> 01:14:23.350
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Here is a
topic we haven't discussed yet,

01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.680
tonight.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:27.590
It says, corruption has
plagued the governments

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:30.830
of all developing countries.

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:34.850
What are your ideas on how to
combat it, how to control it,

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:36.990
how to deal with it?

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:38.490
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
I think the best

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:43.890
antidote that any society
can have against corruption

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:46.800
is education.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.850
A society that--

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.266
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:49.266 --> 01:14:52.710
A society that is
well educated would

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:57.780
be much more resistant to
leaders that are corrupt,

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.480
and corruption, in general.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.400
You can also increase
the penalties,

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.710
like we have done in
Colombia and many countries.

01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:16.740
But it's the values, the
principles, education,

01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:20.460
that, in the long
run, will be the best

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.855
deterrent for corruption.

01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:36.060
I chaired with the prime
minister of Great Britain,

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.800
with Desmond Cameron.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:42.030
The first anti-corruption
World Summit in London.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:48.330
And from there, the idea of
creating an international court

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:50.160
against corruption.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.090
Because more and more the
corruption is multinational.

01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:59.520
It's an idea that is starting
to be discussed in the United

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.020
Nations.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.260
And in certain areas.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:10.710
That could be a complement to
the anti-corruption polices

01:16:10.710 --> 01:16:14.330
that each country
should Put in place.

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.190
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
I mean, there's

01:16:16.190 --> 01:16:19.590
an international dimension
in at least to two cases.

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:25.040
There's the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, which makes it

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.350
a crime say, in the US, for
a company to bribe abroad.

01:16:34.267 --> 01:16:38.970
And there are several cases of
Corrupt Practices in Venezuela,

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:42.910
that are now in American jails.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:46.950
And there was this whole
international impact

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:52.140
of the Brazilian
Lava Jato scandal

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.855
where information was revealed.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.200
Is there now, the typical
thing that countries have done

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.200
is to make government
procurement more complicated.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.390
And--

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.961
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Which
sometimes feeds corruption.

01:17:13.242 --> 01:17:14.950
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Do
you think technology

01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:16.090
might give us a hand?

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:20.516
Or, I mean,
financial information

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:22.130
might give us a hand?

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.380
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: The best--

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.760
I mean, I come from
the journalistic world.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:32.230
The things that the corrupt
people fear the most

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:35.600
is the lack of public opinion.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.900
And so the more laws that
oblige the government

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:42.830
to be transparent.

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:45.330
To make the information public.

01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:47.940
To have the people,
the citizens,

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:51.720
being able to see exactly how
they're spending their money,

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.560
and where it goes.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.560
And how the contracts are made.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.230
That helps tremendously.

01:17:58.230 --> 01:18:00.350
The role of the
press, when there

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:05.070
is a good press or
an inquisitive press,

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:06.570
governments don't like it.

01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:08.170
But it's necessary.

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:12.090
And so there's
different factors that

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.850
can contribute to
fight corruption

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:17.550
with more effectiveness.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:19.410
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
What are the top three

01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:21.690
most pressing economic
challenges facing

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.485
Colombia today?

01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:26.110
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
I would say we need

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:30.030
to diversify more the economy.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:35.550
We still are too much
dependent on raw materials,

01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:36.795
basic commodities.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:43.140
We need to increase
our productivity.

01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:48.480
All of Latin America has a
problem with productivity.

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:56.130
If you compare the productivity
in the Asian countries

01:18:56.130 --> 01:19:00.420
compared to Latin America,
the growth component

01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:03.060
of productivity in Asia
is much, much higher

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.040
than in our countries.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.400
So there you have a
problem, but it's also

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:12.010
an opportunity to grow faster.

01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:16.680
And I would, again, concentrate
more and more in education.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.550
Because education also helps.

01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:29.970
If you give everybody a good
and level starting point,

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.400
you also create more equality.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:38.440
And more equality
is also a factor

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.770
that will contribute to
our growth and to progress.

01:19:46.555 --> 01:19:49.270
RICARDO HAUSMANN: So says,
as an experienced politician,

01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:53.680
negotiator, peacemaker,
and military leader,

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:57.640
what do you recommend
Juan Guaido to do to end

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:01.018
the dictatorship in Venezuela?

01:20:01.018 --> 01:20:02.560
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
I would recommend

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:10.310
him to use his courage
that he has demonstrated.

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:18.150
And try to build, what they
call the Golden Bridge,

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:21.150
for the regime that
is now in power

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.710
to go away as soon as possible.

01:20:23.710 --> 01:20:28.950
But with a golden bridge,
if people think that Maduro

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:33.210
will simply say, OK, I'm going.

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:37.690
And he ends up in a jail
like Noriega in Panama,

01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:39.260
that will never happen.

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:43.590
So you have to give him a
way out, a dignified way out.

01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:45.300
But in order to
do that, you need

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:53.970
to bring in the major
stakeholders of this process,

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.650
International stakeholders.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.410
Who are they?

01:20:57.410 --> 01:21:06.010
China, Russia, the US,
Cuba, and Latin America.

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:13.750
And if he sits down with Maduro
and says, we will negotiate.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:20.680
You go out in transition with
the major stakeholders backing

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:26.400
that, you will then have
a peaceful transition.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.540
Because what I fear
most is any transition

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.150
which will be violent.

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:35.250
Venezuela, and you know
that better than anybody,

01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:38.730
has many, many people armed.

01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:39.230
Chávez.

01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:43.450
Since the very beginning,
followed the Cuban advice

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:49.140
of arming the defenders
of the revolution.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:51.570
The institutions
have been destroyed.

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:55.320
The criminal bands
have taken over parts

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:59.400
of Venezuela, especially
the rich parts where there's

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.440
gold, where there's coltan.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.420
And in order to be
able to control that,

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.710
you have to avoid violence.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:11.520
Because if violence erupts,
to control that violence

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.810
will take a long time.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.190
RICARDO HAUSMANN: I
think we probably have

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:18.580
time for two more questions.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.780
So the first one is from
William [INAUDIBLE] says,

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.780
could you explain how
Ser Pilo Paga works?

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.292
And--

01:22:29.292 --> 01:22:30.750
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Great question,

01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:32.490
because it's my
favorite program.

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:34.053
Unfortunately, it--

01:22:34.053 --> 01:22:35.970
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Let
me translate it for you.

01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:38.285
Being a nerd pays off.

01:22:38.285 --> 01:22:40.350
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Yes,
Being a good student.

01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:50.610
No, we copied that
system from Australia.

01:22:50.610 --> 01:22:53.250
There's a similar
system in Australia.

01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:54.510
What did we do?

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:05.520
The students that graduated
with the best grades

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.070
from the lower strata, the ones
that got the best grades would

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:15.080
have the opportunity go to the
best universities in Colombia.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.340
And the state will pay.

01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.970
You negotiate it with the
universities and they got in.

01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.700
The best university in
Colombia is probably Los Andes.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:35.400
40%, 4-0, of the new
students came because all

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.350
wanted to go to Los Andes.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:41.230
And they competed with
the rich kids from Bogota.

01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:46.210
And, of course, they won
their place in Los Andes.

01:23:46.210 --> 01:23:51.380
So this is a program that has
tremendous social mobility.

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.850
It gives the brightest
the opportunity

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.990
to go to the best universities.

01:23:55.990 --> 01:24:00.550
It improves tremendously the
quality of the education,

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:02.380
where they go to.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:08.840
It's a win-win situation
from every point of view.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.840
The present government
decided to do away with it.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.850
Unfortunately, I must
say, because this

01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:19.400
is one of the best programs.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.170
It was criticized because the
public university said, well,

01:24:24.170 --> 01:24:29.870
why do the students go to the
best private universities?

01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:32.570
Well, if you're as
good as the private,

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:35.270
then they will go
to your university.

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.760
It's competition.

01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.200
But the way it worked
was, 40,000 kids

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:45.530
were able to go to the best
universities in Colombia,

01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:47.420
from the lower strata.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.870
That not only changed them,
they changed the whole families.

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:54.830
You cannot not imagine the
stories behind each kid or boy

01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.020
or girl that are now--

01:24:57.020 --> 01:25:02.600
I just came three weeks ago I
was the commencement speaker

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:05.660
at the graduation of
the first promotion

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.400
of [INAUDIBLE] from Los Andes.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.243
And that was a great revolution.

01:25:10.243 --> 01:25:11.660
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
So it's a signal

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:17.850
that there is an activist
policy for social mobility.

01:25:17.850 --> 01:25:20.810
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well,
can you imagine the people

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:23.120
from the lower strata
having the access

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.660
to go to the best universities?

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:27.500
That immediately
changes their lives.

01:25:31.052 --> 01:25:33.260
RICARDO HAUSMANN: This is
a question from Jared Kenny

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:37.670
from Manchester, New Hampshire.

01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:40.370
Do you still have your
drive for journalism?

01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:43.280
And if so, are there any
stories you'd like to have,

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.795
or had the opportunity
to cover as a journalist?

01:25:47.795 --> 01:25:51.680
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Well,
when I was in government,

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.970
I really missed
being a journalist.

01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:59.105
Because I was a victim
of my colleagues.

01:25:59.105 --> 01:26:00.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:03.050
[INAUDIBLE] some
people in government

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.340
don't understand that.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:11.120
But a watchdog, when everything
is quiet, everything is OK,

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.800
he just sleeps.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.550
When he sees something
bad, he barks or bites.

01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:20.330
And when you're
in government you

01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:26.060
complain, why don't you publish
the good things, the good news?

01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.500
It's a bias that
journalists have,

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.480
but it's a necessary bias.

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:37.480
And I always said that
criticism, and the jurors that

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:42.250
were against the government,
were like a bath of cold water

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:45.550
in the morning that wakes
you up and makes you realize

01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:49.360
that you have to work more.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.460
What stories would I cover?

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.630
The American election.

01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:01.890
It's getting very
interesting, very interesting.

01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:04.820
Very good.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.130
RICARDO HAUSMANN:
Would you have a piece

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:10.628
of advice for any of
the candidates running?

01:27:16.433 --> 01:27:17.850
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
Well, no, it's

01:27:17.850 --> 01:27:20.983
very difficult to give
advice for the candidates.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:30.090
Politics, now, is becoming
very, very different

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:32.100
from traditional politics.

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.685
When Kennedy was
elected, you see

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:40.650
in the museum, the debates
between Kennedy and Nixon.

01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:44.390
And the importance
of the arguments.

01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:49.130
In today's world, the
emotions took over.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.540
And the arguments were
sort of left to one side.

01:27:53.540 --> 01:28:00.140
And emotions are very
easily to manipulate.

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:09.590
Fear and hate and discrimination
and nationalism and me first.

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:14.790
These things are very
detrimental to good politics.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:18.160
Politics, there's transactions.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:23.120
It's not a black and white.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.230
it's not as zero-sum game.

01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:30.370
In politics, you give
something and I gave something,

01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:32.920
and we both agree on something.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.350
That's the nature of
politics since the Greeks

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:37.300
invented democracy.

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.140
But what you're seeing
now, is the contrary.

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:47.540
So I would say that
any candidate that

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:52.250
can recuperate that
type of politics

01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:58.100
based on principles, on
values, and the value of making

01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:58.880
transactions.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.960
In the good sense of
making transactions,

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.870
that makes a democracy
much more effective.

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:11.810
Polarization, the ones
that we're seeing now

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:15.590
in the US and all around the
world, in my country also,

01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:19.620
paralyzes the action
of government.

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:22.235
RICARDO HAUSMANN: Well, ladies
and gentlemen, unfortunately--

01:29:22.235 --> 01:29:25.205
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:35.120
--time's up.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.320
Thank you for coming.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.490
Thank you for your very,
very wide ranging questions.

01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:42.100
Thank you, president
Santos, for your thoughts

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.050
on so many different issues.

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:45.820
And I'm sure that
you will come back

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:49.030
to this place for
another interesting event

01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.900
in the near future.

01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.400
Thank you.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.810
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS:
And thank you, Ricardo.

01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:56.170
I asked him right before
coming in, please, have mercy.

01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:56.830
He had mercy.

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:58.030
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:59.830
[APPLAUSE]

01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:03.780
