PAUL IRISH: Hey guys, and
welcome to the first episode

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.630
of GDL Presents, wherein we
highlight a developer.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.480
Specifically, we're looking at
developers behind some of the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.790
Chrome experiments as of late.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.810
And today, we have with
us Michael Deal.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.450
Michael is a developer in
Portland, Oregon, an

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.800
interactive developer, who's
made some of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.430
coolest stuff I've seen.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.840
And we're going to take a look
at some of his projects, talk

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
about how they've been
built, and talk about

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.230
how he develops things.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.790
So Michael why don't
you say hello.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.854
MICHEAL DEAL: Hello.

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:46.312
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:48.490
Nice.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.940
So Michael, you develop
a lot of things.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.680
Tell me about the sort
of products that you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.430
like to work on.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.200
MICHEAL DEAL: I like to work on
projects that have lots of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.320
colors involved.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.270
And audio's an extra bonus.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.510
But colors are kind of
a prerequisite for

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.650
a project for me.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.230
PAUL IRISH: I dig it.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.640
So you've done a lot of work
with canvas, SVG, a lot of

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.290
audio stuff with web audio API,
and another audio, and a

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.560
pretty just comprehensive
set of projects.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480
So we're going to dive
into a few of them.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.950
But first, I wanted to actually
highlight one of the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.390
things that you did for a site
of ours a little bit ago,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.000
HTML5 Rocks.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.090
You made one of the coolest
tutorials that we've had on

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.210
there about typographic
text effects.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.650
And so this was a great article
where we dove into

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.570
some of the ways that kind of
show off text, giving it a

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.980
neon approach, a stereoscopic
kind of 3D approach.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.640
And so all these manipulations
were just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.920
done in canvas, right?

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.910
MICHEAL DEAL: Uh-huh.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.405
Yep.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.500
They're all in canvas.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.840
PAUL IRISH: I think we had a
little demo page where you

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.613
could kind of swoop in things.

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:20.676
Oh yeah, it was this.

00:02:20.676 --> 00:02:21.110
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.340
So the different affects, they
ticket heavy usage of the

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.680
global composition operation,
which allows you to mesh

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.580
layers in different ways.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.460
And this one, in particular,
is more of an

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.800
animated text effect.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.370
You can do inner shadows and
outer shadows, glows, all

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.145
sorts of things like that.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:47.395
PAUL IRISH: That's
really cool.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.020
Yeah, this is fantastic.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.910
I actually took some of this
code and I made a little

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.045
birthday card for someone--

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:56.680
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh really?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.950
Oh cool.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.400
PAUL IRISH: --using
this approach.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.980
It's a nice and reusable
good quality effect.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.330
MICHEAL DEAL: I'd love
to see that.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.670
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.020
Sure.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.330
So yeah, this is great.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.190
So I wanted to dive into one of
your larger projects that I

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.510
think people might have seen.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.150
Sketchpad was one of the larger
showcase projects that

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.020
we've seen on the Chrome
web store a while ago.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.390
And so this is--

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.380
you want to talk about the
application and how it's built

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.020
and the functionality that
you have inside of it?

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.750
MICHEAL DEAL: Sure.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.670
Yeah, the application was
actually built back in 2008.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.540
And so it's a little bit
of an older project.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.265
But it's held up
well over time.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.930
It takes heavy usage of the
canvas element, as all my

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.770
projects do.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.820
And definitely very heavy
on the style.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.650
The styling was probably the
trickiest part, getting all

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.130
the different types of gradients
and things working

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.190
together in the right manner.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.250
But yeah, it was a really big
learning project for me.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.110
It's where I learned all about
how to really program in

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.120
JavaScript and canvas.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.320
That was my first big project.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.020
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.279
So, I mean, this is
a big application.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:23.730
You have a menu with
these fly-out--

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.880
it's a little hard to
see on the video.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.590
But we have this really smooth
animation as all these little

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.840
non-modal dialogs fly
out, a full toolbar.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.910
How did you go about structuring
the code for this?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.130
MICHEAL DEAL: Structuring?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.550
Well, you know, that's probably
not the best example

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.570
of my work.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.570
Because, like I said, I was just
starting to learn how to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.990
put that all together.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.600
But I guess, ever since then in
writing the newer version

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.395
of Sketchpad, I've tried to
write everything in a sandbox.

00:05:02.395 --> 00:05:07.790
So I'll write one module, one
effect, in a sandbox that's

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.860
completely disconnected
from everything else.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.770
And then, after that
I integrate it

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.300
into the rest of it.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.070
And what's really been useful to
me, too, is doing different

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.080
projects where I can reuse
the project for

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.870
different types of things.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.270
And then, the code base gets
a lot cleaner that way.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.930
PAUL IRISH: A common adage is
the key to writing a large

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.960
JavaScript application is to
never write a large JavaScript

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.600
application.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.744
Break it into the modules
and the libraries.

00:05:36.744 --> 00:05:37.150
Yeah.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.676
That's really wise.

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:38.042
MICHEAL DEAL: Totally.

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:38.410
Yeah.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.010
PAUL IRISH: OK, so we won't
view Source on this

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.595
application.

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:42.070
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.445
I should really compress
that, actually.

00:05:44.445 --> 00:05:45.870
It's pretty bad.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.890
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.190
Cool.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.740
So we'll go ahead and take a
look at MIDI.js, which is a

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.510
really fantastic library that
you put together for taking

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.710
MIDI data and piping it out
into sounds through

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.650
the Web Audio API.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.590
Is that a good description?

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.360
Can you talk about
how it works?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.140
MICHEAL DEAL: Sure.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.300
So the MIDI.js project
allows you to--

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.720
there's a back end to it, where
you can encode your own

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.390
sound fonts into base64.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.260
So you'll take a sound font--

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.440
PAUL IRISH: What's
a sound font?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.200
MICHEAL DEAL: A sound font
is basically any MIDI

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.710
application.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.260
Any type of MIDI instrument
has a sound font

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.950
representing it.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.310
So if you have a flute, or a
guitar, or a piano, each of

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.775
those have their
own sound font.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.530
There's a bunch of different
resources out there where you

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.050
can buy sound fonts and
so you can really--

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.890
sorry.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.835
PAUL IRISH: No problem.

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:59.840
MICHEAL DEAL: I've got
tea in my teeth, too.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.040
Yeah.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.950
Sorry, what was the
question again?

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.050
PAUL IRISH: I was just trying
to understand--

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.200
tell me what sound fonts are.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.080
OK, so a sound font is basically
a representation of

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.330
an instrument.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.260
They take samples of,
like, a piano at

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.180
different types of hits.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.560
And then they combine them
together to make this sound

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.730
font that spans the whole
voicing range of a piano.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:37.530
And the MIDI.js project, it just
basically allows you to

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.235
use one of those sound fonts and
then encode it into MP3 or

00:07:42.235 --> 00:07:43.400
Aug format.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.810
And then, you can include
it in your project.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.980
It's not a really, really great

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.140
representation of the sounds.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.820
But for piano and short hit
instruments, like a guitar, it

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.040
works really well.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.250
In the future, as the MIDI API
is actually introduced, that

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.340
will be extremely exciting.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.392
I'm not sure if you've heard
about that at all?

00:08:05.392 --> 00:08:09.620
But the W3C is actually starting
to put together the

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.130
specs for the MIDI API.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.050
PAUL IRISH: For MIDI?

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.510
Yeah.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.220
I've seen a little
bit of that.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.700
So MIDI.js is pretty powerful.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.100
And so there's a lot of things
going on inside of it.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.650
The output all goes through
the Web Audio

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.330
API, is there right?

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.820
MICHEAL DEAL: That's correct.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.929
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.659
And Web Audio API
is somewhat new.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.140
I think it's been out shipping
in Chrome for

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.130
about a year or so.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.419
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah, that
sounds about right.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:47.650
PAUL IRISH: But just recently,
we heard that Mozilla will be

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.870
developing their own
implementation of what Web

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.090
Audio API, which resolves a

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.960
longstanding kind of situation.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.260
MICHEAL DEAL: With
Audio Video API.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.070
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.150
So I think that was good news.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.130
Everyone was pretty
excited about it.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.990
And so with MIDI.js, a few other
people, I think, have

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.930
already used this,
is that right?

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.860
MICHEAL DEAL: Yes,
that's correct.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.250
A buddy of mine used it to
create a little Simon Says

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.920
application.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.340
And another guy created a really
cool application where

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:26.390
you can actually watch MIDI
drop down as if it was the

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.840
intro to Star Wars.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.380
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.020
We can actually bring that
up here in this case.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.845
So the project's
called Euphony.

00:09:33.845 --> 00:09:35.003
Is that right?

00:09:35.003 --> 00:09:35.930
MICHEAL DEAL: That's correct.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.280
PAUL IRISH: And so Euphony
is a Chrome experiment.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:39.800
And so--

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.170
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.090
PAUL IRISH: --we can get
a view of it here.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:52.020
So here we have a MIDI going
through MIDI.js.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.630
I think the visualization
is in 3.js.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.840
And we can pan around
with the mouse.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.050
We can use the scroll wheel to
zoom in and out and get a view

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:11.080
of all the sound as it plays
through the keys.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.470
It's a really cool visualization
of music.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.450
MICHEAL DEAL: They did a really
great job on that.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.370
That really blew my mind.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.370
And he also used Spark.js, which
is another library that

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.860
you can use along with 3.js.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.780
PAUL IRISH: And what
does Spark.js do?

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.452
MICHEAL DEAL: It's a
particle engine.

00:10:27.452 --> 00:10:30.330
PAUL IRISH: Oh, so that handles
when the note hit the

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.830
key and it kind of blew up with
a little bit of glow.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:33.590
MICHEAL DEAL: Exactly.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.950
Yeah.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:34.500
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.710
That's really great.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.000
Cool.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.090
So inside, I wanted to
touch on Events.js.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.340
And this is a library that
you've written and used in a

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.560
few projects.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.590
Could you just give a
description of what

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.480
Events.js--

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.930
as it is pretty generically
named--

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.925
what kind of things does
it capture and

00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.090
take care of for you?

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.280
MICHEAL DEAL: Well, Events.js, I
pretty much include in every

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.820
project I do.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.800
It makes it really, really easy
for me to develop for

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.980
both mobile and desktop at the
same time without really even

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.790
thinking about.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.975
It supports various gestures
like swiping, and rotating,

00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:19.100
and pinching, and stuff.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.210
And one cool thing is that you
can actually pinch with 10

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.280
fingers or 12 fingers, which
isn't really that useful.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.800
But it's fun.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.000
PAUL IRISH: I think you could
use 10 fingers and a nose.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.330
And actually, recently I heard
that a tongue is conductive.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.580
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh,
there you go.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.590
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, so--

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:42.720
MICHEAL DEAL: You can get
11 fingers in there.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.570
PAUL IRISH: If it was a drawing
app, you could draw

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.820
with your tongue.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.140
I'm just saying you could.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:47.780
MICHEAL DEAL: I haven't
tried that yet.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.460
But I definitely will
give that a shot--

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.780
PAUL IRISH: Works on iPads.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.030
MICHEAL DEAL: --right after
we're done here.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.280
PAUL IRISH: That's cool.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:02.970
It's a multi-finger pinch, zoom,
rotate, those kind of

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.032
typical gestures that you see.

00:12:05.032 --> 00:12:05.380
MICHEAL DEAL: Right.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.860
Right.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.860
And yeah.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.610
And yeah.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.730
PAUL IRISH: And actually, I
think most people don't

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.330
understand the capability of
multi-touch JavaScript that we

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.580
actually have available.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.070
Not many people think that you
can actually check multiple

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.600
touches at the same time and be
able to manifest with that.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.600
But it's actually
not too tricky.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:37.840
MICHEAL DEAL: No.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.620
It's basically exactly the same
as implementing a regular

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.790
touch, or regular pointer
click, except for you're

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.710
working with an array.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:47.920
You're working with three
different arrays.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.390
But you only really have
to work with one array.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.340
So yeah, they did a
really good job of

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.880
implementing that, I think.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.430
PAUL IRISH: Great.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.700
OK, so let's take a look at
another one of your projects.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.810
This one is called Sphere.

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:11.420
And Sphere is a way
to kind of view a

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.540
series of color palates.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.810
Is that how you'd describe it?

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.520
MICHEAL DEAL: Color
harmony formulas.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.390
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.680
Color harmony formulas.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:24.300
And so we have a different few
formulas to pick from, the

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.840
triadic, the five tone,
or the clash.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.850
We can manipulate hue all in
one go, or we can play with

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.880
saturation.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.800
But really get an interesting
palette that prescribes to

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.980
certain color theory that
I'm not terribly

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.370
familiar with, right?

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.830
MICHEAL DEAL: And that's one
theme in my project,

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.280
generally, is that I don't know
anything about something.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.080
And so I really want
to program it.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.140
And that's how I learn.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:01.760
Like Color Piano or the Color
Sphere, it's all just a big

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.310
learning process for me.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.160
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.100
So yeah, we can take a look
at Color Piano now.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.940
So Color Piano is similar to
what we saw with Euphony.

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:22.810
And we have a 2D visualization
of sound going into keys.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.120
And here, we have a number of
your projects coming into

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.080
this, right?

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.650
We have MIDI.js, Events,js.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.690
I would take a look at the
script, but it's MIDI-fied, as

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.510
it should be.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.415
It's actually not
even coming up.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.310
There we go.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.013
Was there any tricky part
in creating Color Piano?

00:14:59.013 --> 00:14:59.940
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh yeah.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.750
It's been a really long
process, actually.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:08.460
I think I started in 2007 just
toying with the idea.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:12.160
But the really big problem was
there was no way to make

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.070
sounds, make the sound
part of it.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.360
So it would work, like, you
know, you could see, visually,

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.315
what was going on, but you
couldn't actually hear what

00:15:19.315 --> 00:15:20.220
was going on.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.690
And so I made a little widget
for the canvas,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.455
or the Apple desktop.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.700
And then I made a little API
that ties into Java native

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.050
interface, which was cool.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.710
But you had start up Java
to get it working.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.560
And so finally, HTML5 came
out with the audio

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.260
tag, which was cool.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.665
But it still sounded like there
was a drunken, I don't

00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:48.080
know, a drunken pirate
playing the piano.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.360
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it didn't
pick up on the

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.570
responsivity of the audio.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.230
It was higher latency then
you needed it to be.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.550
MICHEAL DEAL: Totally.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.240
Which was kind of artistic and
fun, in a way, hearing my

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.460
computer sound like
a drunken pirate.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.120
But it wasn't what
I looking for.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.410
And so when the Web Audio API
came out, the coolest thing,

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:12.480
in my opinion, about it was
that it allows you to plan

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.000
notes to hit at exactly
a specific time.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.160
That's what makes it possible.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.540
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.450
Yeah, it's great and it's
really well developed.

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.135
And you said that Color Piano
is even used in schools.

00:16:28.135 --> 00:16:30.000
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah, that's
what I've heard.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.640
It's really thrilling
to be part of

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.890
the educational process.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.600
One theme you might notice in
all my projects is that I try

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.550
to teach people stuff.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.755
And so, yeah.

00:16:43.755 --> 00:16:46.300
So It was just really
cool to hear.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.650
There was a school in Canada and
then there is a school in

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:52.220
Eastern America.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.500
PAUL IRISH: That's very cool.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.080
So actually, one of the things
that I'm seeing on the Color

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.400
Piano, and I see it in a few
of your projects, is this

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.080
loading spinner.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.450
That's kind of a common
component that you use across

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.700
a few of these apps.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.630
I'm just curious, in this
particular component, how is

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.829
it created?

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:12.839
MICHEAL DEAL: That's
a Canvas element.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:19.310
It uses Bezier curves to create
rounded rectangles.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.640
And it uses the global
composition lighter to blend

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.950
the colors together
in a nice way.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.420
And actually, I'll be releasing

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.610
that Loader.js sometime.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.020
I could do it this week if
people are interested in it.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.780
But I just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.230
But that's definitely
in the books.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.850
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.200
That's great.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.210
How do you handle, like, you
have a lot of projects where

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.910
you're using new APIs.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.350
How do you handle the situation
of the browser

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.750
doesn't support it?

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.490
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah, that's
good question.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.040
I mean, I've definitely gotten a
lot of flack in the past for

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.210
not supporting IE6
back in the day.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.940
But Flash Canvas is great.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.010
There's a lot Polyfills
available, as you're aware of.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.580
PAUL IRISH: Do you make use
of these Polyfills?

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:22.730
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh definitely,
like the BlobBuilder API and

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.860
request animation frame.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.940
So, yeah, the Polyfills
are a real saver.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.870
Flash Canvas, in particular,
has been really great for

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.650
supporting older browsers, like
IE6 and IE7, when using

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.690
flash instead.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:37.880
PAUL IRISH: So it's something.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.040
And I guess these projects you
have a little bit of wiggle

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.690
room as far as your
browser support.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:48.010
But you normally shoot for try
and include IE8 if you can.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.160
But sometimes, depending on
how much audio there is, I

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.010
guess you're limited.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:54.600
MICHEAL DEAL: Absolutley.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.700
I mean, I try to support as
many people as possible.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.690
But there's only so much
time in the day to

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.570
support those things.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.640
And it's a lot more
fun to build new

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.300
applications, obviously.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.130
It's nice when the browsers
actually support them out of

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.050
the box, like IE9, which I'm
pretty stoked about.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.040
And all new browsers really.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.840
It's just such a nice landscape
nowadays compared to

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.390
what it was a few years ago.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.930
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, it's
definitely getting better.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:20.190
Great.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.280
And so I wanted to bring up
a more recent project that

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.410
you've been working on
recently called--

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.820
well, it's your 2.0
of Sketchpad.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:35.940
And so comparing this to your
earlier version a Sketchpad,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.300
it's a much more modern UI.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.360
Do you want to talk a little
bit about how this one is

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.730
constructed and the
feature set here?

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:46.490
MICHEAL DEAL: Sure.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:51.500
So Sketchpad 2.0 allows you
to create a drawing.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.170
You can undo, redo.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.850
All the layers are stored
in vectors.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.440
So you can change the color.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.150
If you're on a stamp brush,
you can change the type of

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:02.830
stamp you're using.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.950
You can select multiple layers,
change multiple colors

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.240
at the same time.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.980
And everything is stored into
JSON on the server, which then

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.060
can be recreated later on.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.100
The images, you can drag
and drop images and

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.730
SVGs into the browser.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.520
And then, you can play around
with image filters and stuff.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.130
And again, those are
non-destructive as well.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.380
PAUL IRISH: This is great.

00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:36.870
And I just noticed you have a
little bit of effects with

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.620
these dialogues coming up.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.290
Let me see if I can
load this back up.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.930
Loading.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:50.890
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh, and I use the
Google font API, which is

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.620
really, really fantastic.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.590
There's hundreds of fonts
available for

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.300
developers to use.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.990
And the fonts, the text tool is
probably the hardest thing

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:01.950
in there to do, actually.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:07.030
Because instead of having a text
box and then showing what

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:11.590
the text looks like later, you
can just place your text and

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.070
see exactly what it looks like
right on the screen, which

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:17.030
involves figuring out the
metrics of the text, which

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.440
isn't available.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:25.980
But you can find through
tricky CSS and HTML

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.070
measurements and stuff.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.330
So it's possible,
which is cool.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.740
It took me a long time
to figure how.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.050
PAUL IRISH: Oh, detecting
the metrics of the text?

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:36.590
MICHEAL DEAL: Yes, to detect
exactly where the text is on

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.190
the screen so you can
create a text box.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.980
So that's just a
Canvas element.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.160
Everything's in Canvas.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.570
There's two layers of Canvas.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.820
No divs or anything like that.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.990
PAUL IRISH: So generally, how do
you detect the positioning

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:52.270
of the text?

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.670
MICHEAL DEAL: Well, so I've
got a little article on my

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.190
website that goes over it.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:05.300
But basically, you would have
a div, a dummy div.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.900
And you'd put some
text into it.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:12.940
And then you'd apply text
baseline bottom or whatever.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.910
Different things to measure
different types of things,

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.900
like where the center line is,
where the bottom of it is,

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.570
where the top of it is.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.520
And then there's
also overhangs.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:26.240
So sometimes text goes outside
of a box, ascenders and

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.350
descenders.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.220
And so for that you have to
actually calculate the pixel.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.860
So you have to run it through a
bounding box calculation to

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.290
find out where the actual edges
of the ascenders and

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:40.572
descenders are.

00:22:40.572 --> 00:22:41.150
Which is tricky.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.790
PAUL IRISH: Are you taking,
literally, the lowercase x to

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.530
determine the x height and
finding out where the pixels

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.120
end from a vertical
perspective are?

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.400
MICHEAL DEAL: The thing, that
was the original idea.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.810
But the thing is, the x height,
it doesn't really hold

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.020
through as much as you'd
hope it would.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.220
But everything's actually
calculated on demand.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.390
So if you write in a paragraph,
then it will

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.320
calculate each letter
individually.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.430
It uses the--

00:23:15.965 --> 00:23:18.135
I forget.

00:23:18.135 --> 00:23:22.730
It uses some sort
of funny text.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:26.060
Here, let me check it
out real quick.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.930
Refresh.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.250
PAUL IRISH: Oh yeah, I was
going to mention a few of

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.100
these dialogues.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.770
We have this nice effect where
it pops the screen out from a

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.320
transform perspective.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.240
And these are actually from
another developer?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.500
MICHEAL DEAL: Yes.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.390
That's from Hakim.

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.680
He's a developer
over at Qwiki.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.690
And he's just fantastic.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.740
He makes different models.

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.440
And he's been putting them out
a lot in the last year.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.550
And they really make your
application just pop.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:01.820
My application didn't really
look that cool.

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.460
And then I threw
that in there.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.002
And all of a sudden I was like,
wow, this is so cool.

00:24:07.002 --> 00:24:07.480
PAUL IRISH: It's look great.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.230
It has a really good affect.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.040
MICHEAL DEAL: It's super
appreciated that you he puts

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.420
that stuff out there for us.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.150
PAUL IRISH: So--

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:20.720
MICHEAL DEAL: But yeah, it's
Meny.js and avgrund.js.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.660
PAUL IRISH: Oh, OK.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.480
Meny.js?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.327
M-E-N-Y.js and avgrund,
A-V-G-R-U-N-D.js and he's got

00:24:29.327 --> 00:24:31.280
a bunch of other cool things
in there, too.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.790
PAUL IRISH: Very cool.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.830
So I wanted to ask you a little
bit of how you actually

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.080
do your development.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.970
What is your workflow
as far as the

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.240
editor that you're using?

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.810
Do you use Lyntin?

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.330
How do you iterate
on your project?

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.290
Do you write unit tests
for these apps?

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.010
That kind of development
experience of these things.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.350
MICHEAL DEAL: Sure.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:58.700
Well, I definitely think unit
tests are a really great idea

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.340
and it's something that I'm
going to get into soon,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:05.170
because otherwise you're
going to get OCD.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.570
Or not OCD, but repetitive
stress

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.560
problems with your wrist.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.740
But so I do all my programming
in DBEdit right now.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.190
I tried to switch over
to Sublime Text.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.500
But the DIF wasn't quite
up to my standards.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.720
But Sublime Text is looking
really, really cool.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.810
But right now I'm still using
DBEdit for everything.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:29.710
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.815
And do you use source
control locally?

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.700
Are you using something
like JSHint or JSLint?

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.740
Just to check your sanity
as far as when

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.510
you're writing code?

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:48.350
PAUL IRISH: I use jsbeautifier
to make my code pretty.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.030
But as I far as sanity checking
, I take it into

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.420
older browsers to see
if it breaks.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:00.520
And then go from there.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.110
But I mean, that's definitely
another thing that I probably

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.960
should be doing.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.900
But I haven't been.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.360
PAUL IRISH: Understandably.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.260
Yeah, I mean, I ask because
with applications of this

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.160
scale, it starts
to get tricky.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.930
You'll have a bug.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.040
And you think you fixed it.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.540
And it'll come back.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.800
It's a little tricky
to manage.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.300
So you mentioned before, you
find yourself writing your

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.700
apps as far as smaller
libraries and

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.770
modules coupled together.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:35.470
What's your system for building
out those central

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.380
components?

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.430
MICHEAL DEAL: Well, I
like to start a new

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.970
project as much as possible.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:47.240
It's really nice, because
it just clears my mind.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.790
When you're working on a really
big project, you have

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.245
all this stuff loaded
into your mind.

00:26:50.245 --> 00:26:51.730
And there's just
so many things.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.830
But if you can get it into a
small component, like just

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.880
some sort of an effect or
something, then it just makes

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.360
it so much more simple.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.295
So I put everything
in a sandbox.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.025
And then I just plug away
at it from there.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.920
But actually, for my SVG
support, I did do some sort of

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.210
testing where you can put
the SVG in there.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:21.860
Then to the left of that,
you'll see what it

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.480
looks like in Canvas.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.110
Then you'll look to the
bottom of that.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.750
And you'll see what it looks
like in Canvas re-rendered

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.680
through my VOB format.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.650
And then on the bottom right,
you can see what it looks back

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.990
in SVG after it goes
back all around.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.290
And it's supposed to look
the same both ways.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.360
So visual testing, I've done
that a little bit, which is

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.360
really handy.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.640
I'm more of a visual guy.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.320
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.010
Absolutely.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.630
So you make use of a lot of
really great techniques.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.730
Where do you pick up
these techniques?

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.060
What sites are you reading,
people do you follow to keep

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.600
track of that sort of stuff?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.310
MICHEAL DEAL: Oh gosh, back in
the day it used to be Ajaxian.

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.540
That was really cool.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.890
Badass JS is cool.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.750
Creative JS is great.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:10.410
Twitter is amazing.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.650
Twitter seems to be the place
right now to really get

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.280
inspired and see everything
that's happening, if you

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.840
follow people like you.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.640
There's all sorts of great
people out there

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.170
posting these things.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.580
Chrome experiments, obviously,
you get a lot

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.880
of inspiration there.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.180
I mean, I just basically try
to keep a pulse on what's

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.440
going on as much as possible.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:46.110
And I just focus on trying to
stay up to date as much as

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.400
possible as to what
people are doing.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.600
It's really mind blowing what
people are doing nowadays.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.066
It's just insane.

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:56.290
I'm really impressed with
the 3D work, especially.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:01.890
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, yeah, having
all the 2D graphics APIs that

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.910
we have now combining with
what's available on audio and

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.510
the experience is getting pretty
heavy pretty quick.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.510
Pointer lock just landed in
Chrome a little bit ago.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.760
That's more of a 3D thing.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.150
But there's a lot going on.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.760
So it's pretty exciting.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.790
MICHEAL DEAL: Yeah, it's so
nice that you can finally

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:28.180
control, basically, all the
outputs the computer has.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.142
You've got the audio control.

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:30.600
You've got the pixel control.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:34.080
And so you can do, basically,
most things you need to do.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.340
The file management's still
not quite there.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.090
But they're making a lot
of progress on it.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.820
It's really cool to see all the
new things they're doing

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.890
there, too.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:47.340
And obviously, connecting into
MIDI ports and stuff like

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:54.210
that, game control API, which is
really interesting as well.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:55.130
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.030
Well this is great.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.990
And so I encourage everyone to
go and check out your blog.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:06.080
It's over at MUDCU.be

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.480
MICHEAL DEAL: MUDCUBE.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:06.760
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.130
It's on MUDCUBE.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:08.820
You'll find it.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.980
And so it goes through
all your projects.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.660
We went through the
older Sketchpad

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.580
and the newer Sketchpad.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.830
But you also ported
this to mobile.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.290
It's called Sketch Mobile and
has a new interface that's

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:25.840
designed exclusively for touch
and smaller screens.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.680
So it's fantastic.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.990
And it walks through a lot of
your other projects and all

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.650
the stuff that you put out
there, including the colored

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.650
website and community that we
didn't even get a chance to

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:39.800
touch on today.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:40.540
But they have a lot.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.710
It's a great community around
color, color palates.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:51.980
Probably the best gradient
creation tool that I've seen

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.060
is inside colored.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.000
So excellent stuff.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.973
So I encourage everyone to--

00:30:55.973 --> 00:30:56.680
MICHEAL DEAL: Thank
you so much.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.750
That was a collaborative project
with my buddy Daniel

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.660
Christopher, who works
right next to me.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.130
We've been working together
for the last 12

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:05.960
years a little bit.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.732
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:10.130
Cool.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:18.030
And so follow Michael on both
GitHub and Twitter, at MUDCUBE

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:20.230
on G+, @MichealDeal.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.460
And that's about it.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.690
So Michael, thank you very
much for joining us.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.305
This has been fantastic.

00:31:26.305 --> 00:31:27.852
MICHEAL DEAL: Well, thank you
so much for having me.

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:30.700
You guys have a great day
and enjoy the rest

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:31.900
of the summer here.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.440
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.040
We will.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.390
Awesome.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.140
Thanks very much.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:34.440
Bye.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:34.740
MICHEAL DEAL: All right.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.040
Take care.

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.290
Bye-bye.
