00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.020
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.910
I'm Louis Gray, here from the
GDL studio, in Mountain View,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.020
for what I think is going to
be an exceptional event.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.990
We are talking with the team
from Codenvy, who has created

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.230
a cloud-based IDE which
runs exceptionally

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.960
well on Chrome OS.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.740
For many of you who know me
online, we've talked a lot

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.540
about Chrome and the development
of a web platform

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.940
for a long time.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.940
Often, when I talk about Chrome
OS, people are really

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.880
excited about its promise, but
there's still a few questions.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.640
What can't it do?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.830
And one of those questions
that often comes up is

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.470
development.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.760
Hey, I'm an engineer.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.050
I've got to use my IDE.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.720
I have my standard tools that
I always use, but what about

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.390
running these IDEs on Chrome?

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.570
And so today, we're going to
talk about precisely that with

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.860
the Codenvy team.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.280
I'm joined in studio
with two guests--

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.570
Tyler and Steven.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.470
Welcome, and thank you for
joining us at GDL.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.630
TYLER JEWELL: Thank you
for having us, Louis.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.075
LOUIS GRAY: I appreciate
all the work that

00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:32.970
you've done so far.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.140
And we're going to deep dive
into that product.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.180
We also have an avid
user of Codenvy.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.740
Joining us from London, from
our Hangout room in Studio

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.170
Campus is Addy Osmani.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.120
Good day, Addy.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.510
ADDY OSMANI: Hey.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.320
LOUIS GRAY: Thanks
for joining us.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.710
And I remember we came across
the idea of bringing Codenvy

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.480
in studio from the enthusiasm
that you showed around using

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.940
it yourself.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.290
Is that right?

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.360
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
that's right.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.360
I absolutely love using
[? Codenvy. ?]

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.395
It's one of those really
great tools, a fit.

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:05.900
Something that's been missing
in my workflow on Chrome OS

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.340
for quite some time.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.570
And I've been using it for a
few months, and it's been

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.080
really great.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.610
LOUIS GRAY: That's cool.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.650
So thanks for joining
us, Addy.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.800
So obviously we have the people
behind the product, we

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.750
have an exceptional user
of the product,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.410
then you've got me.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.590
So you got three out of
four-- really solid.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.130
LOUIS GRAY: So I want
to just talk, real

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.100
quick, about Codenvy.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.030
As someone who's not an
engineer, I read about these

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.970
things like IDE.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.610
I read about Eclipse, and I read
about Xcode, and I read

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.180
about other platforms.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.990
And I really want to understand
when it came to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.030
developing your product,
first, how did

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.640
you have the idea?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.790
And what is it that
sets you apart?

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.850
How have you looked at the
opportunity that is there

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.470
today with Chrome and the web
to start what you've done?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.640
I'm sure you have a presentation
as well.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.660
TYLER JEWELL: Well, first of
all, thank you for having us

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.050
here today.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.890
We're just absolutely excited
about sharing what we're doing

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.250
with the entire Google
community.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.610
The actual first bits
for Codenvy started

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.220
about four years ago.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.790
And it was part of a French
company called eXo Platform.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.660
And they make a collaboration
solution that competes with

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.080
Yammer, Podio, and some
other companies.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.570
And they needed to build some
IP that was multi-tenant IP

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.079
inside of a Java virtual
machine.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.107
And they had invented this IP,
and they were looking for a

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:26.760
way to test it at scale.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.160
And they had never had 50, let
alone 100 developers, come to

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.140
use this system all at once.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.690
And so they were kicking
around some ideas.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.000
And they said, well, hey, what
if we were to build a widget

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.540
factory for our platform,
and we did it as

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.130
a cloud-based IDE?

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.740
And they did it, and they got
about 50 to 100 users.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.330
And these users were really
excited, and they proved out

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.330
the IP that was there.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.260
And the users were so excited
about what they experienced

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.770
that the engineering team just
kept moving forward with it.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.050
They said, well, what if we
could do this for Java, and

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.730
what if we could do
this for Python?

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.390
What if we could
do it for Ruby?

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.780
And they kept improving it, and
the traffic kept growing.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.130
And in 2011, they said, well
jeez, what if we could take

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.310
the code and deploy
it directly onto a

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.430
platform as a service?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.290
And they added support for
originally OpenShift.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.630
But quickly after that, it was
Google App Engine, on that.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.810
And the product took off.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.360
So this is one of those
situations where when we first

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.370
started with it, it
was meant to be a

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.180
technology garage project.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.940
But it turned into something
that was incredibly popular

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.240
and useful along the away.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.710
And the traffic took off so
much so that we decided to

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.640
take it away from the French
company, create our own

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.200
company with it, and that
happened in January.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.434
And we raised some capital--
$9 million.

00:05:48.434 --> 00:05:50.480
And we're now a legitimate
business.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.820
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.950
And we often have people come on
Google Developers Live and

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.190
talk about how they started
their startup.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.400
How they came out of one idea,
and it morphed into something

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.270
else, based on customer
demand.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.600
And it sounds like you
ran into that.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.180
The more features you poured
into this product, it really

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.810
became an extensible platform.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.410
Maybe you can take me back to
this idea four years ago about

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.040
working on the cloud platform,
as it was.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.230
As we know, just in the last
several years-- you mentioned

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.750
App Engine.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.400
App Engine has gotten
exceptionally stronger and

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.930
more powerful than it was
just a few years ago.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.580
And now we have new tools all
the time, new pieces of the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.890
web, that enable you to become
more like a standard

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.840
application.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.050
Can you help us understand
that-- how the web has grown

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.160
underneath your feet
and let you grow?

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.200
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah, well, I
think what the web offers to

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.580
us is that it's an environment
for instant provisioning

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.410
that's there.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.630
And we didn't realize this when
we started building the

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.600
product, but we figured it out
at scale, that the problem we

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.400
were solving was not that we
were giving developers tools.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.940
But the problem we were solving
is that we were saving

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.510
them the desktop administration
pains.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:02.370
So when developers work with a
traditional IDE like Eclipse,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.370
you're looking at minimum of
time of hours to get to,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.160
"Hello World." And it's not just
because they have to set

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
up the IDE.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.470
It's also the build system, the
runtime, all the plug-ins

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.250
that they've got to
manage on that.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.610
And with web technologies, web
allows us to set up the entire

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.500
same environment instantaneously
and

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.660
automatically.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.150
So what used to take hours for
"Hello World," we can take

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.400
down to seconds with
a cloud-based IDE.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.460
And so when developers start
seeing that instant access

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.500
benefit, and it's still inside
of an industrial strength

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.410
tool, that affinity actually
wants them

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.530
to use more of that.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.390
And that's where the stickiness
comes in.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.930
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.550
And as somebody who uses Chrome
OS as just a boring old

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.340
consumer, one of the things I
really like about it is I feel

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.720
like every computer
is my computer.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.100
It really doesn't matter.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.160
I love my Pixel to death, but
if it broke tomorrow, I can

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.460
just jump on any machine that
has access to Chrome and get

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.310
all of my content
back with Sync.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.810
TYLER JEWELL: Sure.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.620
LOUIS GRAY: Is there something
to that, in terms of that

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:05.660
instant on and portability, that
your users have liked?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.860
TYLER JEWELL: I think that the
users like the fact that you

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.350
can use almost any browser to
gain access to it, whether

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.150
it's a mobile browser or a web
browser that's out there.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.880
It certainly gives them
device portability.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.380
It also gives them team
portability in that they can

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.850
bring other members into the
system right away without

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.620
having to go through a

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.640
configuration exercise of that.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.790
And what we're starting to
discover is that there's a new

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.820
class, or a new category, of
developers that are emerging

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.460
because of cloud IDEs.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.039
Previously, you had those
people who were primary

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.600
adopters of a workbench.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.900
And then you had people who
were kicking the tires,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.309
looking for new tools.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.900
Now there's a new
middle category.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.830
We call them auxiliary
developers.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.610
These are people who are
commuting to work, and maybe

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.630
they have a Chromebook.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.910
And they just need something
that's instant access.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.490
It's the hackathon.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.720
I've got two, three, four of my
buddies, and we're going to

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.080
spend two or three hours, and
we just want to start coding

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.900
and not deal with the set
up of the environment.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.340
There are some large
organizations who separate

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.820
work between the back end
and the front end.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.420
And this is a way for the back
end developers to say, here's

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.280
an environment for you to start
working on the front end

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.670
that's there.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.460
Vacationers, as well.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.340
And so there's all these
auxiliary groups who need an

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.820
occasional workbench for certain
types of projects.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.620
But then they also have their
primary workbench for their

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.460
permanent projects, as well.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.270
LOUIS GRAY: Sure, and I
understand you brought an

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.830
overview of the product.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.820
And maybe you can go through
that now and give us a little

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.390
bit more detail on Codenvy.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.540
TYLER JEWELL: OK, we're going
to give a demo here on it.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.770
Why don't I just run through
just a couple of slides to set

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.690
context on it.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.800
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.640
TYLER JEWELL: And then
we'll do the demo.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.210
So thank you, everyone.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.300
Obviously, we are a cloud IDE.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.240
We think of ourselves as an
industrial strength tool for

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.400
developers.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.750
And the problem we're solving
is that there was a LinkedIn

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.180
survey done of 1,200 engineers,
and they asked how

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.470
do you spend your time
during the week?

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.900
And those engineers reported
back that they invest 13 hours

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.870
a week just in administering
their desktop.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.320
It's a third of their time.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.590
And we were really surprised
by that.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.770
But these studies actually
hold true.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.690
There's a lot of cost
to managing that.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.690
And depending upon the tool
that you've got, it can

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.180
actually be more costly.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.660
And so we thought, hey, there's
actually a better way

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.710
to do things.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:24.040
If you could have the ability
to create any type of

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.050
application, anywhere in the
world, off of any device, and

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:33.430
then have your work shared in a
global community, where you

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.180
could increase collaboration
on that, then what would

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.210
happen is that developers would
spend their time coding,

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.850
administrators would spend their
time configuring, and

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.930
managers could spend their
time monitoring, there.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.620
And that is why we
built Codenvy.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.330
So Codenvy is a centralized
environment.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.990
And what we did is we took the
logical workspace that was on

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:59.450
the desktop, and then we
decoupled it from its hardware

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.060
dependencies and moved it
entirely into the cloud.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.940
Inside of that workspace
is a bunch of things.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.240
It's not just an IDE, but
there's an entire build system

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.820
for compiling, testing,
packaging your code.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.010
And there's actually a runtime
inside of your workspace as

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:21.230
well so that you can execute
the code, debug it, and

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.060
prepare it for the
[? actual ?]

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.310
deployment into a
PaaS as well.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.970
Obviously, the workspace
is entirely

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.350
accessible by browser.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.370
And then your project type is
automatically configured,

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.480
based upon either the language
that you select or the

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.210
production environment
that it's going

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.390
to be deployed into.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.390
So the more we can learn about
the type of application that

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.340
is being built, the more we
can restrict the system to

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.280
prevent failures and
error rates from

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.670
configuration down the way.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.400
We're toolchain compatible.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.620
So from within the IDE, you can
deploy directly to a PaaS,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.870
kick off a continuous
integration build, or commit

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.120
your code to a code repository
like GitHub or Bitbucket.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.010
And then once the workspace is
there, you then have three

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.290
modes of collaboration.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:11.640
You can do it like WebEx,
which is popular with

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.640
instructors and classrooms.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.280
There's a collaborative mode
like Google Docs, that we're

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.260
about to demonstrate here,
where you have multiple

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.830
cursors in the IDE, itself.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.140
And then there is a factory
concept that allows you to

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.850
clone entire work
spaces as well.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.760
And then you can create replicas
that reflect the same

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.420
exact configuration and runtime
environment that you

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.500
had before.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.510
And that's very popular
for support scenarios.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.600
A developer who is coding,
they have some sort of

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.530
syntactical error, they
want some help.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.680
They can take a snapshot of the
entire workspace, post it

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.250
on Stack Overflow, and then the
readers of that thread can

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.550
click on that and see exactly
what the previous developer

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.150
was having at that
point in time.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.210
So with that, we've got
a lot of users.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.400
We're about 75,000 users.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.160
We represent a lot
of Fortune 500

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.600
companies on a global basis.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.760
Our users come from all
over the world.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.440
We see people frequently from
China, India, Brazil,

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.040
Venezuela, Russia, all the
Nordic countries as well, all

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.430
through Europe, and obviously,
the United States, too.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.300
It's possible to build
APIs, web apps,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.460
mobile apps, and SDKs.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.980
Even at Google I/O, we betaed an
Android framework as well,

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.210
where you could actually create
an Android app, compile

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.830
it, create the Android
packaging, and then actually

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.620
run it in a hosted
emulator as well.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.110
LOUIS GRAY: I have started to
see people talk about taking a

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.710
complete mobile only approach
to development.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.800
Can I make a mobile app just
on an Android tablet or an

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.570
Android phone?

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.550
It really seems today almost
like a science experiment.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.120
But it's probable that not too
long from now that that will

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.520
be just as standard as a
desktop, with mobile

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.300
penetration being as
strong as it is.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.140
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah,
that's right.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.470
I think that when you see this,
the technology that

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.320
allows for emulation or any sort
of broadcasting to the

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.260
browser is strong enough where
you have as good performance

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.720
through that as you would on
your desktop that's there.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.570
So now that that performance
threshold has been crossed,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.030
it's really just a function of
taking all those technologies

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.580
that were on a desktop and
providing them in this shared,

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.260
instant access environment
here.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:25.620
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.250
TYLER JEWELL: So I think we're
passed that one threshold.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.490
And we're just moving to the
delivery side of it now.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.670
So I'm going to pause there.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.020
Let's go into the demo.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.210
After we do a demo, later on,
I'm sure we're going to get

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.590
questions about our
architecture

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:40.360
and stuff like that.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.950
We come back to that as well.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.270
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.360
We do have a lot of questions
on Moderator.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.420
So we have a number of those
that we will get to, as well

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.000
as talking through Addy's own
experience with your product

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.650
that really got us excited
about Codenvy

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.530
in the first place.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:52.960
TYLER JEWELL: Cool.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.150
LOUIS GRAY: One thing that you
mentioned, you talked about

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.630
the capability of these
machines and the

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.940
enhancement to it.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.650
Being on Chrome OS, and I see
Steven, you have a Chromebook

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.060
Pixel with you as well, what
is it about Chrome OS that

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.540
makes it a compelling machine
and platform for Codenvy?

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.680
Is this the realization
of cloud plus cloud,

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.880
or what's the story?

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.010
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:19.950
STEVEN LE MEUR: I think you can
use the ability to be able

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:25.160
to work from everywhere with
your Chromebook is something

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.830
very interesting with Codenvy.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:36.730
So we should jump to
the demo, probably.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:37.680
LOUIS GRAY: Cool.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.170
Let's go ahead and
pull up the demo.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:40.440
TYLER JEWELL: OK, great.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.990
STEVEN LE MEUR:We will
demonstrate the power of being

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.690
able to work with your teams
from everywhere you are.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.410
TYLER JEWELL: Cool.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.670
All right.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.090
Steven has just joined
Codenvy.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.110
He's been a lot of the
brains behind the

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.180
future product designs.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.750
And we saw that there were
questions already about

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.380
where's the future direction
of that?

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.790
And he's the man behind
all that stuff.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.040
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.350
So if I want him to talk about
the next generation that you

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.190
don't want to talk about yet,
I'll just keep asking

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:09.910
until he tells us.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:10.700
TYLER JEWELL: That's right,
that's exactly it.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.300
And he will tell you,
by the way.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.160
LOUIS GRAY: All right, so we'll
look for that in about

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.740
20 minutes, then.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.140
TYLER JEWELL: You ply him with
another Pixel, and he's going

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.010
to just splurge everything
you've got.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.448
LOUIS GRAY: You came
to the right place.

00:16:18.448 --> 00:16:21.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.600
TYLER JEWELL: So great.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.700
Here's our home page.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.770
It's pretty straightforward.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.790
I'm just going to log in.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.260
You don't have to create an
account through forms.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.390
You can obviously create an
account through OAuth.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.430
And we support the Google
OAuth technology there.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.460
But I want to log into a
particular account here.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.590
And when you log in behind
the scenes, we're

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.530
actually loading an IDE.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.360
Your IDE is going
into a cluster.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.000
We actually run up to about 250
IDEs per process there.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.580
So we actually have a
really high density.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.590
But it's going into
a system, and now

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.190
I'm part of the community.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.270
At any given point in time,
there is approximately 1,000

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.310
developers who are coding,
building, and testing in here.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.490
Your environment is isolated
apart from all the others,

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:13.240
even though we've got a
multi-tenant architecture

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.480
behind the scenes.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.170
And the IDE pops up here,
and its design is very

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.230
Eclipse-like.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:24.560
It is meant to be an industrial
strength tool.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.560
There is the concept of
projects in here.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.650
We can either create a new
project or import a project

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.100
from GitHub from this.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.170
You can create projects of
many different types, and

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.300
we'll just go ahead and Create
New Create Project.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.610
And what we do is we ask you a
couple of details about the

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.740
project that you're
going to create.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.530
What language is it?

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.250
What environment are you
going to deploy to?

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:53.430
And depending upon the language
that you select, like

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.530
if I wanted to do a Rails App,
it certainly selects the

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.710
different PaaS providers that
are available for Rails.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.130
And so there's certainly
some matching

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.180
that's going on there.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.730
Just to demonstrate a couple of
the capabilities, I'm going

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.700
to do a Java Spring app.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.600
And I'm not going to deploy
it to a PaaS.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.750
I'm going to say None.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.430
And that means it's only
going to run in our

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.960
runtime here as well.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.210
And just give it a name,
Google Demo, here.

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:25.870
I'm going to just do a very
simple Spring application with

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:26.830
a template.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.540
And now it's loading
the project.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.000
The IDE, itself, has multiple
panes, as you would expect an

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.980
IDE to have.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.610
We can give you different
views of your project.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.770
We can certainly give you
different views of the windows

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:43.950
that are available.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.650
And what I'm doing here is I've
got a Project Explorer.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.370
This is a Java application.

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.240
And I'm just going to
open that Java app.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.910
And in the lower right
corner, you can see

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.240
we're working hard.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.890
And what's going on over here
is that we're parsing the

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:00.320
source code trees.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.080
We're figuring out all the
dependencies across the

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.780
different libraries
that are there.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.850
And eventually, the editor is
going to clean itself up.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:11.620
Right now, when it opened up,
it's giving me all sorts of

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.140
red squigglies, all sorts of
error conditions here, because

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.080
it hasn't parsed all the files
in the project that's there.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.580
But after it gets initialized,
this stuff will get cleaned

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.700
up, and it's all ready to go.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.620
And this is a completely
workable application.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.790
We can compile it.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:28.870
We can run it.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.750
And so we'll just go
ahead and do that.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.740
And I'm going to say Build.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.500
And we've got a whole variety
of windows that will show up

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.520
on the bottom here.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.330
And so you've got
output windows.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.170
It's going to have a debugger
window that we can show up.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:51.670
If there's any error codes,
it'll come up here as well.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.890
So you can see that the
build is successful.

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.450
Now for the build, we have an
integrated, Maven-based build

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.230
system in here.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:06.700
Maven uses pom.xml as its,
basically, recipe for how the

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.580
build should work, with what
dependencies, and where those

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.930
dependencies are going
to come from.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:17.490
We have both a private Maven
repository inside of Codenvy

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.070
for all of your local libraries,
but it also can an

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.400
access any library that's
available in

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.640
Maven Central, as well.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.440
So you can create an
application, reference jars,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.240
SDKs, or other types
of libraries.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.260
And we'll automatically
synchronize with that and

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.710
bring them into your workspace
based upon the codes that

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.030
you've gotten in here.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.960
Things are fine.

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.010
So it's no big deal.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.640
So I'm just going to go ahead
and run, and I'm going to run

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:43.830
the application.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.410
And when it's running, what
actually happens is that the

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.340
files are getting synchronized
on the different clusters.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.280
So when we say build, what
happens is all your project

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.820
files were synchronized onto a
completely different cluster.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.310
And we've got a series of nodes
that are processing

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.100
those builds, even though it
appeared that it was all

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.140
happening on one
interface here.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.910
And then the same thing has
happened on the run.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.560
So we've taken the artifacts
that were built, and we've put

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.390
them onto a run cluster, and
we've started up a server.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.150
I think in this case, it's
Tomcat running Spring.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.310
And there's a URL here.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.040
And I can click that URL.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.320
I can click that URL, and the
app is now running, and it's

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:27.980
going to load here.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.920
And you'll see that
it's a completely

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.110
functioning Spring app.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.400
LOUIS GRAY: And so for some of
that, you literally took the

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.380
abstraction, and you virtualized
some of the

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.310
complexity.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.570
So what you're showing is the
tip of the iceberg in terms of

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.600
all the technology that's
running behind it.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.960
And for the engineer and the
coder who's making the

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.250
content, it looks like
any other interface.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.580
But on the back end, you're
doing all of this

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.755
synchronization, making sure all
of cluster management is

00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:48.350
there, as well.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.800
TYLER JEWELL: That's right.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:55.830
Yeah, we're trying to give a
desktop-like experience.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.430
But it's actually highly
distributed behind the scenes.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.180
LOUIS GRAY: Well actually, what
it is is many desktops.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.250
It's many different desktops
with only one single monitor.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.470
And that monitor happens
to be a web browser.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.700
TYLER JEWELL: That's
right, yeah.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.490
And if you think about it, when
you're running on your

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:12.670
desktop, you're running many
processes all at once.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:16.440
So even though it's all on one
node, there's the build

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.400
process, the run process, the
IDE process, and we distribute

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.540
those processes onto, actually,
separate clusters.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.300
And it actually ends up having,
in many cases, some

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.900
users talk about it being faster
than their desktop.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.280
Because if you think about
development, it's highly

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.280
sporadic, but very intense
bursts of activity.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:38.670
And so when you're building on
your desktop, you almost never

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.500
use all of the resources that
are available to you.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.210
So when you're working in the
IDE portion, that's a ton of

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:45.430
file manipulation.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.740
And so that's I/O intensive.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.920
But when you're doing that,
the CPU is idle.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.270
But when you say, hey, let's
build my application, it's

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.560
very CPU intensive, and now
the I/O is idle, and the

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.740
memory is idle.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.950
And obviously, the runs
are memory intensive.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.640
So by separating those onto
separate clusters, you can

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.460
actually still use the IDE while
the build is going at

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.330
full throttle.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.470
And even though the run is
there, you can use the other

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:11.630
functions as well.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.090
So you can get overall better
performance, and we can throw

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.020
a lot more horsepower at each
one of those functions.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:16.480
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.770
And I think there's always
been this trade off,

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.380
especially the last 10 years,
with the capability of

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.220
networks increasing so much
further than CPU.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.870
You have this interesting
trade off of it being

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.070
CPU-bound versus network
latency.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.340
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.250
LOUIS GRAY: And now that you
were able to abstract all that

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.920
on the back end with the
massive clustering, and

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.400
hopefully, on the internet
side that the pipe is big

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.470
enough for the user, everything

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.700
works well in the cloud.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.280
And what are the kind of
questions you get around

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.150
connectivity?

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.730
We often get that
for Chrome OS.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:43.750
What apps are online?

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.360
What's not online?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.590
How do you handle either
intermittent connection, slow

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.760
connection, or no connection?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.720
TYLER JEWELL: So yeah, we get
a lot of questions about the

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.040
connectivity element.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.000
The most common question we get
is, is there some sort of

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.220
offline support?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.910
And we don't have offline
support today.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.240
But we're working at what would
an offline model be?

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.050
Because for a lot of people,
just being able to edit the

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.050
files offline is
not sufficient.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.710
They want to be able to compile
them, and they want to

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.660
be able to run them.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:18.190
So offline support for us means
many shades of gray.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.620
So we don't provide
that today.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:24.630
But in terms of intermittent
connectivity or slow pipes, it

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.850
actually is quite good at
the end of the day.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.850
Because if you actually put a
sniffer on it, the amount of

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.200
traffic that goes between
the browser and the

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.940
server is very limited.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.020
The only time that that sort of
conversation even needs to

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.470
take place is when there's
actually a server side

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:44.410
activity, which is essentially
file manipulation, which is

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.590
like a refactoring command,
or a build, or a run.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.750
And that's actually very
few and far between.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.840
So we actually do quite well
on slow or intermittent

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.140
connections that are there.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.070
And that's how we've
managed it so far.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.360
And we hope that we're about
to year away from having an

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.030
offline capability.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.940
And we'll actually use this
Google Packaged Apps

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.190
technology to do that.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.410
LOUIS GRAY: Sure, so I don't
want to hijack it and get

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:09.850
interrupting of your demo.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.270
So I want to go through this,
and then I want to transfer

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.750
over to Addy to have him talk
more about his experience as

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:18.340
well as possibly JavaScript,
HTML, CSS-- a lot of what the

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.540
Chrome fans are looking for.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.650
TYLER JEWELL: No problem.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.920
So here, we ran the app.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.660
Inside the Editor, itself, after
the app run, you can see

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.710
that you've got all the things
that you would expect.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.220
You can do code completion
in here.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.520
We can set break points.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.780
We can actually run
a full debugger.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.050
I'm not going to go through
that right now.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:41.520
You can see that there are
Help on the right.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.910
We've also got Help
on the left.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.030
We can do a lot of interesting
things, like we can refactor

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.220
the code if we wanted to.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.020
I could go up here to Edit.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.250
We could refactor that variable
or the method name,

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.330
and it'll propagate across
all the factors.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.380
You can generate getters
and setters.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:59.010
You can send code pointers.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.010
There's a lot of things
you can do.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:06.720
If I wanted to commit this code
to a GitHub repository,

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.870
we've got a full set of
capabilities in here.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.090
The code is running
inside of Codenvy.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:15.100
It's a local repository
that we've created.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.710
So you could either clone a
remote repository in, or we

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.510
could initialize this repository
and then push it

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.130
off to GitHub.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.770
And we support all your GitHub
credentials in both public and

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.260
private projects in
here as well.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.140
On the PaaS front, we obviously
have a huge number

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.270
of PaaS providers
that we support.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.460
Our most popular one, by over
50%, is Google App Engine.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.430
And so when you're done working
with the bits in here,

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.610
I could log in.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.520
I could then create a Google
App Engine account--

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.920
I have to create a unique
identifier off that.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.690
And then I take all these bits
and push it on there, and

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.130
we'll ensure that it actually
is going to run accurately,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.290
because we've restricted our
own environment on that.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:27:00.390
We're actually running the
Google Cloud SDK in our local

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:01.140
environment.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.930
So you can make use of all the
APIs that you would have

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.130
access to in the Google Cloud
environment here as well.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.327
The last demo we'll get, and
then we can get into Addy, is

00:27:11.327 --> 00:27:15.440
Steven, I think, he's going to
log in at some point in time.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.430
And he's going to be able
to join the account.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.030
And so what I would typically
do is I could come in here,

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.180
and I could share and
invite developers.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.770
And previous to this call, I
invited him on his email

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.030
address into my workspace
here.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.570
And so this is now a shared
work space on that.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.500
So he can join, and I think he's
going to come into the

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.110
Google demo here.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.850
And at some point in time,
on the right, he's

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:39.490
going to show up.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.630
And there he is.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.690
He's shown up.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.630
He's got a little red signal
there, meaning that he's not

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.830
in the file up, but now
he's in the file.

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:50.170
And somewhere, he's going to
come into the code, and he's

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.790
going to start typing.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.550
And oh, he's going to say hi.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.700
Hello, Steven.

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.950
Very friendly of you.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.860
Would you like to
code together?

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.510
And he's going to just type
some code here or

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.760
right after that line.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.440
Put some code in the
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.210
There we go.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.500
And you can see his cursor
right in the middle.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.150
I could put my [? cursor ?]
over it.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.890
He's going to start typing.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.750
And so we're actually
working on the same

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.950
file at the same time.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:27.200
LOUIS GRAY: Mm-hmm.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.440
TYLER JEWELL: If I were to go
and issue the build, it would

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.380
be a simultaneous build
at the same time.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.250
If I were to issue the run, it
would be a simultaneous run.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.130
LOUIS GRAY: And this type of
collaboration is very familiar

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.240
to those people who have used
Google Docs as a suite.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.480
You see who's logged in.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.620
You see exactly where
their cursors are.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.960
It's cloud computing
in a new approach.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.320
TYLER JEWELL: That's right.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.000
That's exactly right.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.380
And this is a highly
flexible sort of

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.840
collaboration system here.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.600
What we're actually doing behind
the scenes is we're

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.610
caching all the files that
are in the project

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.870
into a cache server.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.050
And so he's actually running
on a separate

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:02.720
cluster than I am.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.990
And so we're on two
separate IDEs.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.860
And so the cache server is

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.730
synchronizing all of our changes.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.430
And then when we do certain
actions, it then synchronizes

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.570
the saves back to the
synchronization server across

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.110
the different environments
that's there.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.350
So there's actually a lot of
technology that goes into just

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.785
making this work at this pace.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.390
And this is what we
provide today.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:34.310
So we have a large range of
languages that we support.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:38.050
We have a large range of
platforms that we support.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.070
You're going to see us get a
lot more aggressive in our

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.830
expansion--

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.460
we've been slowly trickling
things out--

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.760
from here on out.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.330
But going forward, we're
just on the verge

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.930
of shipping an SDK.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.030
And that SDK is actually going
to allow the community to add

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.810
their own languages, add their
own frameworks, add their own

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.300
platform as a service providers,
add their own

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.030
continuous integration
servers.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.480
And so you can change the entire
system through the SDK.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.500
So we've found that we can
only add one framework or

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.050
language a month ourself.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.510
And we can hope to bring
others into it.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.680
And we can make this a system
that's usable by all.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.310
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.000
I really like the expansion when
you talk about using the

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.640
SDK as a platform and all these
platforms as a service

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.400
that you're supporting.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.040
It almost becomes that your
platform is a new platform.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:24.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:24.700
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.140
LOUIS GRAY: We must go deeper.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.030
So Addy, I definitely thank
you for being so

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:28.870
patient with us.

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.260
ADDY OSMANI: Not at all.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.980
LOUIS GRAY: You got us excited
about Codenvy in the first

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.970
place, at least you
did for me.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.950
These guys have been excited
about it for years.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.170
I wanted to have your input,
not just from a user

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:42.080
perspective, which would be
awesome, but really thinking

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.590
from the world of Chrome where
you live every day, when you

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.720
take a look at the web platform
and HTML development,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.700
CSS, JavaScript, really talk
about how Codenvy has enabled

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.890
that for you and for
others like you.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:55.350
ADDY OSMANI: Sure thing.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.490
So I think there's something
really magical about being

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.900
able to build web apps, mobile
web apps, all sorts of

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.260
applications and sites on the
web using tools built on web

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.360
technologies.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.890
It's sort of Inception-y
in a way.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.930
And I thought that
was really neat.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.710
But I spend a lot of time in
using Git and GitHub every day

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.930
in my workflow.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.235
And that's been something that's
been missing for me

00:31:18.235 --> 00:31:19.900
when working on Chrome OS.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:23.600
I've been missing the ability to
be able to open up a Repo,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.330
call on something someone else
has worked on, just being able

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.820
to file patches and easily
preview them and maybe push

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.670
them off to a different PaaS,
or Heroku or somewhere else

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.190
with App Engine and so on.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.100
And Codenvy has really enabled
me to do that.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.330
And it hasn't taken me that long
to actually learn how to

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.110
use this and integrate
it into my workflow.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.110
If I happen to be using a Pixel
and if I perhaps don't

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:51.610
have my [INAUDIBLE], or I don't
need it, I can just

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.370
easily hop on this and continue
working on whatever

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.950
project it was that I was
working on other machines

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.430
very, very easily.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.430
The workspace is
already there.

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.000
Any commits that I've made are
just instantly accessible.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.030
And the same collaborative
workflow that the guys were

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.470
showing a little bit earlier
actually works with GitHub

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.390
projects as well as
Repos as well.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:18.000
So if I happen to import in a
GitHub project where a few of

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.310
my friends have been
contributing, and I want to be

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:23.360
able to collaborate with those
friends, it can instantly let

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.920
me invite those people, all
the techs who's been

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.200
contributing.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.630
I can just send them out a
Codenvy invite and get them

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.910
into the project as well.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.305
So we're all collaborating
inside the same workspace.

00:32:33.305 --> 00:32:34.840
And I think there's something
really, really

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.420
powerful about that.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.740
So I actually wanted
to show two really,

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.880
really quick demos.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.080
Is that cool?

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:42.880
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.720
We can definitely shift
over to your screen.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.580
And we'll ask Peter in Studio
to make sure that happens.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.100
ADDY OSMANI: Awesome.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.760
Let me know as soon as you
can see my screen.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.950
LOUIS GRAY: We've got
it right now.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.740
ADDY OSMANI: You've
got it, awesome.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.320
So as a modern web app
developer, you probably spent

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.450
a lot of time working with
JavaScript, maybe GitHub,

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:02.430
maybe things like App
Engine, or Heroku.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.160
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about Heroku really

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.570
quickly, and then I'll talk
a little bit more about my

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.450
GitHub workflow with Codenvy.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.050
So one of the nice things about
the templates that they

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:13.646
were talking about earlier is
that I can just go and create

00:33:13.646 --> 00:33:14.500
a new project.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.860
And if I wanted to, say, start
work on a Ruby on Rails

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.110
project, I can go and I can
select the template here.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:22.820
And in the PaaS section
down below, I

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.990
can just select Heroku.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.160
Give this project a name.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:30.574
Let's call it Unicorn
App or something.

00:33:30.574 --> 00:33:32.360
And you can go and click Next.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.960
I can select a template.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.525
I'm hoping that they're going
to expand the templates or

00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:37.670
something in the future, but
this works right now.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:38.730
It's actually pretty neat.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.440
So I can just click on next.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.255
It'll optionally ask me
about my application

00:33:42.255 --> 00:33:43.400
name and remote name.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.720
I'm just going to skip those.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.390
And then I can click Finish.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.010
And what this normally scaffolds
you out is actually

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.760
a complete small Rails
app that you can go

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.420
start hacking on.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.510
All of these are files
you can actually go

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:56.500
in and start editing.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.890
So I've got my Index
file here.

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.170
And if I wanted to go
into [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:03.520
Heroku.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:06.740
So because Heroku was selected
as the PaaS service, it's

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:09.310
actually gone and created
me a new Heroku app.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.820
So if I went over to my Heroku
account, I would actually

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:14.610
already see the app in there.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.139
And I'd be able to preview
what that looks like.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.659
So this is just a very
empty Heroku app.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:23.050
If I wanted to push this current
code base and scaffold

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:25.929
it out over to Heroku, it's
really, really simple.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.400
I just go to Get,
Remote, Push.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.960
And when that's loaded up,
I just click on Push.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.270
And what normally happens is
it opens up this little

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.380
Progress box at the
very bottom.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.139
It just tells me that it's
successfully pushed to my

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:44.460
Heroku app, and I then have the
updated version of what

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.449
was scaffolded out ready
and previewed for me.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.969
Now if I went in and I was to
actually make any changes to

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.850
this, I can easily go back
into the Git menu.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.159
I can commit any
of my changes.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.100
I can reset.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.050
I can add, and do most of the
things that I'm going to be

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.270
using on a daily
basis in here.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.776
Now moving on to talking a
little bit more about Git and

00:35:03.776 --> 00:35:08.215
GitHub, if you happen to love
working within your shell and

00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:10.580
you need access to
that, Codenvy

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:11.960
actually has its own shell.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.980
So you can click on Shell
inside the IDE.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.880
So I'm just waiting
for it to load up.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.390
Can you guys see the shell?

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.050
It's this black screen.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:23.020
LOUIS GRAY: It's a five second
delay on the screen.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.270
ADDY OSMANI: OK.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:26.710
LOUIS GRAY: There we go.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:27.480
We see it now.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.610
ADDY OSMANI: Anyway, while I'm
waiting for the shell to load

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.226
up, basically, what it lets you
do is get access to a ton

00:35:32.226 --> 00:35:35.760
of commands that you can use
on your local workspace.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.380
So I'm just going to type
in Help on this.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.630
Can you guys see it yet?

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.550
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, we do see
the shell terminal,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.280
absolutely.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.760
ADDY OSMANI: Awesome, great.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.410
So if you type in the Help
command, you can actually see

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.780
what's supported inside
this shell.

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.620
And you'll see that there are
a number of Git commands.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.490
There are some other commands
that can help you work with

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:58.290
specific back ends and your
general workflow inside a

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:58.520
Codenvy app.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.700
And I just felt that
was really neat.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.850
I hope that someday you'll be
able to do things like maybe

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.490
use NPM and all sorts of
other stuff in here.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.980
But I'll ask them about that
a little bit later.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.730
Another thing that I found
really awesome was the ability

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.280
to work with GitHub projects
very, very simply.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:24.250
So if I go back inside my IDE
window, and I go to Projects,

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:28.860
New, and then Import
from GitHub--

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.170
now what this is going to do
is it's going to go and

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.675
basically fetch all the
different organizations that

00:36:33.675 --> 00:36:37.810
I'm a part of on GitHub and all
the different Repos that I

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:38.770
might be a part of.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.290
Just a list.

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:44.210
And I'm then able to actually
select a specific organization

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:45.160
or account.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.860
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to select

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.570
my own GitHub account.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.840
And there's a little application
that I wanted to

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.700
play around with in Codenvy
called Angular Shopping Demo.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.430
So I'm going to select Angular
Shopping Demo and just Finish.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.540
I think it's going to ask me to
close the current project.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:06.250
One second.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.620
It's going, and it's
cloning this.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.170
It's going to ask me what
type of project this is.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.650
So it's a JavaScript project.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.710
I'm just going to
click OK, here.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.360
It's then going to go.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.090
And it's going to ask me if I
want to close the existing

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:25.310
project and open up the new
one that I just cloned.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.130
And I can now go and actually
start working on this app.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.040
So one nice thing I noticed
when I first used this was

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.220
when you open up a mark up file,
you can actually go to

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.640
the Run menu and Show Preview
to get a preview of your

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.260
application without
even having to

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.710
go deploy it anywhere.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.620
And I thought this
was really neat.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.850
So I can actually make changes
and see them live on my screen

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.650
without having to go
really do anything.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.580
So this is a preview
of my application.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.060
Just to show you that it's
working, I'm going to make a

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:57.400
few, very minor [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.110
[? reactions ?]

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.360
in here.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.580
But one problem I've got is this
is actually just hosted

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.860
on my master branch of
my GitHub repository.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.500
And I'd love to actually be able
to share the URL for this

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.990
with other people.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:17.780
And so I want to be able
to push this project

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:20.170
up to GitHub pages.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.860
Now if we go to another tab that
I have open, this is a

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.330
tab that's got 404 in it,
if you go over to it.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.950
This is where I hope my
GH pages version of

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:32.120
this app would be.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.360
But it's not, because I haven't

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.730
actually pushed it there.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:37.340
So what we're going to do is
we're going to fix this.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:40.700
We're actually going to push
the application into there.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.130
And just for kicks, we're
also going to

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.745
make some minor changes.

00:38:44.745 --> 00:38:49.130
We're going to change the H1
on this page to say Unicorn

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.300
Shopping, instead.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.540
And I'm going to then
save that change.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.680
It'll show me a little dialogue
that says, "Updating

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.750
Content."

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.480
And then I go to the Git menu.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.080
I'm just going to commit this
change, just so I've got a

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.700
record of it.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.195
So made it more awesome.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.965
I'm going to commit
this change.

00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:17.840
And I get a little status
update about it.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.360
And then what I'm going
to do is I'm actually

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.680
going to go to Git.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.130
I'm going to click on Branches
just take to take a look at

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.030
what branches I've
got available.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.690
And I see that I do have a
GitHub Pages branch available

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.220
on my repository's origin.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:36.210
So what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to go to Git,

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:39.730
Remote, Push.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.540
And I'm actually going
to push from Master

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.770
to my GItHub Pages.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.104
Now what this is basically going
to do is it's going to

00:39:48.104 --> 00:39:49.952
take all the files that I'm
working on at the moment in

00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:52.440
Master, and it's just going to
push them up to GitHub Pages.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.740
There may be a little bit of
latency when it comes to how

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.130
soon that's active, but
I'm hopeful it's not

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:59.620
going to take too long.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.960
So I'm just going to
press Push on that.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:06.770
And it says that it successfully
pushed it there.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:11.400
Let's see if the GitHub gods
are with us today.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.420
And what you should hopefully
see, if there's not too much

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:17.480
latency on this call, is that
my app has actually been

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:21.740
pushed to GitHub Pages,
and it's working fine.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.010
I'm going to buy myself some
pants and some shirts and

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:25.550
other things.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.260
I can start interacting
with this application

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.740
a little bit more.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.580
And everything works.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.770
Now you might be wondering, what
if I want to start using

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.340
things like NPM modules in here,
and I want to be able to

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.100
interact with that?

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.410
I haven't really been able to
figure out how to do that in

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.300
the Codenvy workflow just yet.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.670
I'm hoping that it's something
that may come sometime in the

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.970
future, if it's something, I
guess, that's popular enough

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.490
or is a priority for the team.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.920
But other than that, I've
actually been able to work on

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.460
a lot of different GitHub
projects directly inside of

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:05.907
Codenvy without having to go
back to the command line or

00:41:05.907 --> 00:41:09.960
worry that I'm not in a complete
environment where

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.860
I've got access to the
command line and all

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.270
of that other stuff.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.810
So I'm really happy with
Codenvy, so far.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:22.730
I know that they've put a lot of
work into it over the past

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.730
few years, and it's only just
going to get better over time.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.760
So yeah, please check it out.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.970
That's my recommendation.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:30.540
I think it's amazing.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.110
LOUIS GRAY: Well, thanks
very much, Addy, for

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.260
going through that.

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.850
Hopefully, you got a lot of
feedback in terms of Codenvy--

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:38.540
what he likes and some future
enhancements it sounded like

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.310
he was asking for.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.600
TYLER JEWELL: We need
to hire him.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.445
LOUIS GRAY: Well, he's
not available.

00:41:42.445 --> 00:41:44.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.390
LOUIS GRAY: We have
a non-poaching

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.695
clause here on GDL.

00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:47.000
TYLER JEWELL: Ugh.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.130
LOUIS GRAY: You can't get any
of the GDL employees.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.550
But we might have you
guys fill out a

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.490
form on the way out.

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.020
That's how it works.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.100
As long as you want
to work together,

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.100
why not work at Google?

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:56.820
TYLER JEWELL: Wow.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.210
LOUIS GRAY: So we'll talk about
that after the show.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.200
TYLER JEWELL: That's awesome.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.020
That was a great demo.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.140
Thank you, Addy.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:01.500
ADDY OSMANI: Thank you.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.810
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, Addy's one
of the real big experts in

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.600
terms of the web platform
and Chrome.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.220
We always go to him for any
of the tough questions.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.800
So I'm glad he's really
found your program

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.200
and platform valuable.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.670
So we have a number of questions
in Moderator.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.340
And I know both you and Steven
are going to go through those

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.800
and really talk about not only
what Codenvy can already do,

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.580
but possible directions
that it can go.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.260
And I know many different people
have their own favorite

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.550
coding environment, their own
languages that they need for

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.790
their platforms.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.250
And so, not surprisingly, that's
where a lot of these

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.890
questions come from.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:36.490
So we'll start at the top with
one of the more exciting

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.760
languages to come out of late,
which is the Dart platform.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.750
And the first question comes
from a guy named Chill Fox, in

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:46.330
Australia, if that is his real
name, and he asks, will

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.290
Codenvy get support for Dart?

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.420
TYLER JEWELL: Well first, inside
of Codenvy, we've got a

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.300
lot of people there.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:57.500
And I've made the proclamation
that I believe in five years

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.965
that Dart will actually
supplant JavaScript.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.630
I think it's the modularity
of it.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:09.755
I think the fact that you can
have a compile phase that runs

00:43:09.755 --> 00:43:12.150
inside of a VM-- there's just
a lot of enterprise benefits

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.020
that come from that.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.850
So we believe that.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.090
We will get Dart support.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.870
Now, the way that we're going to
add Dart, and this is also

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:25.600
the same that goes true for Go
support as well, is we're

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.470
going to publish the SDK.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.990
We're also going to publish with
that all of our examples.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.130
We will have ported PHP, Python,
Ruby, and all of the

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.130
Java components to that.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.460
And we're going to then rally
the community around making

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.830
use of that SDK.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.260
And we'll then come up with some
sort of governance model

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.370
where we can then bring those
languages and frameworks in.

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:49.920
And I actually think Dart is one
of the earlier ones that

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:50.570
needs to happen.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.760
Because it would be exploitable
with this type of

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.180
architecture, partly because
it's not just Dart, the

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.260
language, but there's
also Dart to JS.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:00.970
So there's a compilation phase,
which makes it really

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.310
suitable for a build-based
system that's there, whether

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.560
it's Maven or we go with a
different sort of system.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.670
Who knows on that?

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.390
But then on the runtime,
we can take a Chromium

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:14.400
environment, actually run that
local, execute your Dart app,

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.120
so that you don't have to
leave the browser all

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:21.520
together, even though it's a
full, enterprise-oriented

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.620
mulit-dependency Dart
application, if you will.

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.040
So that's going to be
our path to that.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.610
In terms of time frames on this,
the SDK is going into

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:31.890
beta next month.

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.440
We're going to have that
be a controlled beta.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.040
We've got about a dozenish
partners who are working with

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.880
us on that.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.700
And then it will definitely
be published before

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.760
the end of this year.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.800
So I think we need a couple more
months, and then we can

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.410
get optics on exactly when
some of these important

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:48.010
languages are going
to show up.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:48.320
LOUIS GRAY: Cool.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.070
So you say next month.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.007
Next month is actually
pretty quick.

00:44:52.007 --> 00:44:53.500
TYLER JEWELL: What's
today's date?

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:54.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.590
LOUIS GRAY: We're
still in June.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:56.870
TYLER JEWELL: Oh, OK.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.470
LOUIS GRAY: So sometime in
July is what I'm hearing.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.890
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.850
LOUIS GRAY: Even with
the July 4 holiday?

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:06.610
TYLER JEWELL: Well, we do our
engineering in Europe.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:07.600
LOUIS GRAY: So they don't
celebrate our

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.220
independence much?

00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.170
TYLER JEWELL: They
don't understand.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:10.520
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.230
Because I know often here at
Google, things start to slow

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.960
down next week.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.120
And we'll keep track of that.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:15.650
Very cool.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:17.470
So you talked about Dart.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:18.560
You talked about Go.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.950
Obviously, those are two
languages we talk a

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.070
lot about on GDL.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.110
The Dartisans community is
exceptionally passionate.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.060
And I like your projection
of Dart taking over where

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:30.020
JavaScript is in not too long.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.570
I know a lot of people here
will be happy about that.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.940
And we really hear the
advantages of that every day.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.170
So it's good to hear you're
talking about it.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.440
There's another question around
your actual design.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.960
Some people like the IDE.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.660
Some think it needs a little
bit of a bump up.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:46.740
What can you talk about in terms
of the look and feel of

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.900
the IDE for Codenvy today?

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.170
STEVEN LE MEUR: Maybe the first
point is that it's a

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:52.410
tool for developers.

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:57.200
So it must feel something
like robust, solid.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.020
And I think it's delivered
this message.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:06.800
And maybe the point is that
we should make it

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.420
a little more modern.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:15.010
So that's definitely something
that we will work on.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:23.460
But we should take the time
to deliver something

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.980
great to our users.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.830
And for sure, we will work with
all our communities to

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.500
get their feedback on what they
like, what they don't

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.060
like, and what we can improve.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.060
So I think it will be a
collaborative way to do the

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:44.830
work on the next version of
the design for Codenvy.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.470
LOUIS GRAY: So you mentioned
where the

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.580
development takes place.

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.860
But there's another type of ware
that I'm curious about

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:50.990
with Codenvy.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.460
Do you make Codenvy
with Codenvy?

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.970
TYLER JEWELL: We do.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:55.530
LOUIS GRAY: You do?

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:56.050
TYLER JEWELL: Yes.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.860
LOUIS GRAY: So how do you
compile to itself--

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:58.230
TYLER JEWELL: It's painful.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.070
LOUIS GRAY: --withouth going
into an infinite loop?

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:04.070
TYLER JEWELL: OK, now you're
just geeking out, all right?

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.740
So it's painful, because
Codenvy is

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:08.485
actually built with GWT.

00:47:08.485 --> 00:47:08.870
LOUIS GRAY: Mm-hmm.

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:12.910
TYLER JEWELL: And for those of
you who's used GWT, there is

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:15.660
dev mode and there's non-dev
mode with GWT.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:19.340
And if you're in non-dev mode
with GWT, it's about 11

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.890
minutes to compile
your application.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.030
And that's certainly
not a workable

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:25.120
fashion that was there.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.430
So if you're in dev mode, you
get incremental compilation,

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:30.990
which is a workable answer.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:34.140
And so we had to do a lot of
work to basically take the dev

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.790
mode, which only works in
Eclipse, and make that

00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:39.550
workable in our environment
there.

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.640
And so it's Maven-based.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.230
We actually support Maven
multi-module, so that you can

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.080
decompose all the work to
different team members.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.690
So we've got that work
decomposed in that.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:53.190
We use a Maven multi-module
project.

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.430
The builds run on a local
Codenvy instance that the

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:57.880
public doesn't have access to.

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.010
It's in our environment
that's there.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.590
And then the output--

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:03.940
and we have the ability to
route output to different

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.490
acceptance servers, staging
servers, and whatnot, there.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.540
But we recognized, when we
decided that we were going to

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.330
make this into a commercial
entity and that it was going

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.090
to stop being a garage project,
that we were never

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.390
going to get real global
adoption unless we could go

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.280
out and tell the world that
we were using it--

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.410
eating our own dog food, as
well, or drinking our own

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.490
champagne, as the French
like to say it.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.330
LOUIS GRAY: Uh-huh,
much better.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.350
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah, and so
last fall, we told the

00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:34.310
engineers, well, come summer,
you've got to use it.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.020
So they put the things
in there that they

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.760
needed to make it work.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.820
LOUIS GRAY: Godd, I hoped
that was the answer.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.270
So there are some questions
around the mobile presence.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.220
I think we talked about coding
on mobile, and we addressed

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:46.800
that somewhat earlier.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:48.260
Is there anything else you
want to say, in terms of

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.530
mobile presence, for Codenvy?

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.040
TYLER JEWELL: When they say
mobile presence, are they

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:56.150
talking about accessibility
through a mobile device or

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.560
development of mobile apps?

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.300
LOUIS GRAY: You'll have to
ask Daniel from Tacoma.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.120
All he says is, what mobile
presence will Codenvy have?

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.440
TYLER JEWELL: OK, well I'll talk
about the accessibility

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.030
over mobile.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.180
And then I'm going to let
Steven talk about using

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.900
Codenvy to build mobile
applications.

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.340
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.540
TYLER JEWELL: So in terms of
accessibility, because the

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.560
product there's two things-- we
do a lot of right clicking

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.850
inside the product, and the
product is structured a

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:20.530
certain way.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.580
It's not really touch ready.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:26.560
So we need to have a
special browser.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.250
So we use Puffin web
browser on that.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.560
We're certified on that.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.990
And that gives you a simulated
right click that

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:33.670
you can use on that.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.020
And so we have a lot
of apps who are

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.400
built that way on that.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.520
Also, you can actually access
and create apps on an iPhone.

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.660
It's not the best experience
in the world.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:45.430
But there is that
accessibility.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:48.950
It's not shaped for the iPhone
screen resolution, but it is

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.860
navigatable in that regard.

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.770
So that's on the accessibility
front, and I think we'll just

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:56.280
incrementally improve that for
different screen shapes and

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.180
different input devices
over time.

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.590
In terms of using Codenvy to
build mobile apps, we've got

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.200
two things that we're
working on--

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.360
Trigger and the Google
project.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.740
STEVEN LE MEUR: Yeah.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:12.530
So we have some few things in
our roadmaps on making it

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:17.270
possible to build an application
on a [? formal ?]

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:18.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.000
directly from Codenvy.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.830
So we will do that.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.040
We will add some cool
stuff to demo later.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.080
We already demoed during
Google I/O.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:33.530
But in fact, the idea is for
an Android application, for

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:38.000
example, you will be able to
develop, to get access to the

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.250
Android SDK directly
from Codenvy.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:49.127
And you will be able to deploy
on the emulator directly on

00:50:49.127 --> 00:50:53.395
the web, and also directly
on the device.

00:50:53.395 --> 00:50:57.400
And we will put something, a
QR code that you will scan,

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.230
and it will install the
APK on your device.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:07.930
So there's a few things that
are coming and that are

00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:10.750
already in our roadmaps.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:11.200
LOUIS GRAY: Great, fantastic.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.960
Now, we actually talked about
a couple of the questions,

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.360
already here.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.570
One of the questions is around
running as an offline IDE.

00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:18.080
I believe we addressed that.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.360
There's another question around
the limitations and

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.870
stipulations applying to Open
Source Premium Account, and

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:26.110
what languages and libraries
will be available at launch?

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:28.310
Additionally, what language and
library support will we

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:31.240
see in the future?

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.900
TYLER JEWELL: So the way our
pricing works on the public

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:37.390
cloud is that it's free for
unlimited number of

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:41.050
developers, as long as your
projects are public and you're

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:45.200
OK using shared build
and run queues.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.470
If you need to have private
projects or a dedicated queue,

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:51.625
which gives you guaranteed
access, then you have to be on

00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:53.460
a premium plan.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.290
Our premium plans all have the
same functionality, but they

00:51:56.290 --> 00:51:58.290
are different prices based
upon whether you're a

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.465
commercial entity,
an individual, or

00:52:00.465 --> 00:52:02.800
an open source project.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.780
We give it away for free to
open source projects.

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.620
And the conditions there are
that you've got at least three

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:11.290
committers and that the project
has been accessible

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.490
for at least six months there.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.590
So we're looking for
that it's an

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:16.940
established project on that.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.080
In terms of what sort of
libraries are available, any

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.380
library through Maven Central
is currently available.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.570
You can also upload your
own libraries.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:26.790
There's a technique that you
can use where you can

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:30.001
basically upload files into your
project space, and then

00:52:30.001 --> 00:52:32.500
those files are locally
accessible as a library.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:35.470
And that actually works for Java
type projects and other

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.340
projects as well on that.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.500
And then did I capture
all that?

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.860
What's coming in the future?

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.410
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.240
TYLER JEWELL: There's a lot
coming in the future.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.920
There's some stuff that we're
going to ship very, very

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.360
shortly here, which is going
to allow onboarding of

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.100
projects and libraries of
many thousands of types.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.210
And it's going to be
really interesting.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:55.450
We should have that before
the end of summer.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:52:55.700
LOUIS GRAY: Very cool.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.130
And I think that would possibly

00:52:57.130 --> 00:52:58.710
make the UI more complex.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:00.190
So I'm looking forward to seeing
how you handle that.

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.350
TYLER JEWELL: It's going
to be less complex.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:01.810
LOUIS GRAY: Less complex?

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.380
More virtualization.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.720
TYLER JEWELL: No, not
more virtualization.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.520
Actually, if you think about
it, the UI we have today

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.950
actually makes it more complex
than it needs to be.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:13.390
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, I think that
was some of the feedback.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.260
TYLER JEWELL: Well, we have
to make it more modern.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:20.160
But today, to get to this point,
you've got to log in.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.930
You've got to have
credentials.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.460
You've got to then
create a project.

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:25.460
You've got to know what kind of
project you want to create.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.440
And if you think about it, most
people start off and say,

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:32.630
I want to do an AngularJS
app on Ruby on Rails.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.450
So that should be their starting
point, and we'll make

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.550
that their starting point, as
opposed to the other stuff.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.930
LOUIS GRAY: There was a question
here from London--

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.710
one of your counterparts,
Addy--

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.580
asking about deploying to
a local virtual machine.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:48.090
Are they able to do that?

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.340
TYLER JEWELL: Deploying
to a local, virtual--

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.160
LOUIS GRAY: A local VM.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.165
Am I able to deploy
to my local VM?

00:53:53.165 --> 00:53:53.490
TYLER JEWELL: Oh, OK.

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:57.340
So I think the feature that
would allow for that is either

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.670
an FTP based deployment
mechanism or an SSH.

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.520
That's like a secure shell and
some sort of remote VM.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:06.100
We don't have either those
capabilities today.

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:12.030
It's a very, very frequently and
commonly requested feature

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:12.470
that's there.

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:14.740
So I think that we've been
pretty good about adding

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.590
things that are commonly
requested, and I think we'll

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:19.040
get to that.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.980
By the way, for those who are
interested, there is a user

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.940
voice site right off
of our Home page.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.130
Click Feedback.

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:28.460
We religiously watch all
the features and the

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.340
votes that are there.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.760
So click Add Your Own Request,
vote, vote, vote.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:33.460
We love it.

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.440
We listen to it.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.830
We obsess about it.

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:36.880
LOUIS GRAY: Well, it sounds like
listening to customers is

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.650
a good idea.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:39.250
And it sounds like you're
doing that.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:42.350
There's another comment over
on the YouTube side from G.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.040
Hussain Chinoy Asking about
Gradle support.

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:47.060
Is there Gradle support
or only Maven?

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.955
TYLER JEWELL: There's only
Maven, but before the end of

00:54:48.955 --> 00:54:51.480
the summer, we'll have both
Ant and Gradle as well.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.910
Those will be both native
build support.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:56.810
LOUIS GRAY: And Jorge, also on
YouTube, is asking, what is

00:54:56.810 --> 00:55:00.650
the bandwidth recommended
to use the application?

00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:01.190
TYLER JEWELL: Recommended?

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.550
I don't think we have actual
specs, but it's going to run

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:08.460
just fine on like a sub
megabit connection.

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.390
LOUIS GRAY: Submegabit?

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.190
TYLER JEWELL: Submegabit.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.900
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:11.250
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah.

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.350
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:13.690
I don't want to try that out,
because I don't want to have

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:14.350
submegabit.

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.820
But I believe you.

00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.120
TYLER JEWELL: I think the only
time you get into a couple of

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.270
issues is that we use WebSocket
technology to handle

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:24.770
communications back and forth.

00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.590
And so if you have a very
intermittent connection, it's

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.290
possible that the editor loses
its connection to the server,

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.370
and the code is not
automatically saved.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:38.370
So what we'll do to resolve that
is we'll allow people to

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.490
go back into a non-performant
mode, like a default mode,

00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:44.370
where every time you have
to manually save.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.350
And if it doesn't save, then you
know you've got a problem

00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:47.980
sort of thing.

00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:49.670
LOUIS GRAY: Now you brought up
your presentation at Google

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:52.710
I/O. Marlon Jones, over on the
YouTube side is asking about

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.890
another introduction that we
did a Google I/O, which was

00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.090
the Google Play Games API.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.500
He wants to know if it's
possible to use the new Google

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:03.590
Play Games API with Codenvy?

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.170
TYLER JEWELL: Do you know?

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.070
I don't even know anything
about the API.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:13.270
STEVEN LE MEUR: Yeah, this is
an API for all games on the

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.972
[INAUDIBLE] and iOS
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:16.410
TYLER JEWELL: Oh.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:21.890
STEVEN LE MEUR: So probably,
we will, after the features

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:25.780
that we will deliver next month,
we will be able to

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:30.120
leverage the power of these
APIs through our factory.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:36.100
So you want to make your project
with these APIs, it

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:39.630
will be very easy for
the onboarding.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:47.146
So it will be super easy to make
your mobile applications

00:56:47.146 --> 00:56:50.460
based on these APIs.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.370
TYLER JEWELL: Do you know what
the format of the API?

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:54.140
LOUIS GRAY: We have other GDL
events that talk about Google

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.550
Play Games API.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:56.980
So definitely you'll want
to check those out.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:57.280
TYLER JEWELL: OK.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:58.210
LOUIS GRAY: It's
very, very new.

00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.890
We're really excited about it.

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:03.360
There's a question on YouTube
about game development and

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.970
other development, so I think
a more broad question.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:10.040
What type of applications do you
see users today building

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.480
on Codenvy?

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.160
What's the most typical type
of application people make?

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.760
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah, so I think
the most common things that

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:20.890
people are developing are web
apps that will ultimately

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.620
operate in an online PaaS.

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.650
That's the most common.

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:27.810
And then the second thing,
a lot of API development.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:31.710
So people use it to create the
API, publish the API, and make

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:34.640
that API accessible
that's there.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.550
Those are the two most commonly
requested mobile app.

00:57:38.550 --> 00:57:40.275
A lot of people want to
use the browser to

00:57:40.275 --> 00:57:41.420
create mobile apps.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:42.350
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:44.990
Now Addy, I know we still have
you there, and we're coming

00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:47.310
close to the end of
our allotted hour.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:49.100
There's a little bit of
background noise, so I know we

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.250
had to turn down your
volume a little bit.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:52.950
So we'll be sensitive to that.

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:54.860
Is there anything you wanted to
ask the team while they're

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.430
here, before we close?

00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:59.880
ADDY OSMANI: Sure, so I had a
few questions that I know that

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.510
some web app developers are
going to be really interested

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:03.700
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:07.590
So I'm really excited about
things like AngularJS,

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:10.520
Polymer, Backbone,
Ember and so on.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.170
Can developers in those
communities hope to see

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:16.280
templates that will help them
kick start off, in terms of

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:18.640
development of those types of
projects, inside Codenvy in

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.550
the future?

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:22.700
TYLER JEWELL: Yeah, I think we
just hired, essentially, a

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:26.450
program manager, much the way
that Google has their own

00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:29.060
program managers for working
with the developer community.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.400
And the biggest part of the job
of the program manager is

00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.300
basically creating these little
miniature, let's call

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.720
them template communities that
are out there so that you can

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.360
quickly get started with
pretty much any type of

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.470
project that you want to get
started with on that.

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:46.940
I think we've done a very poor
job of delivering on the

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.240
popular technologies that are
out there, even though Codenvy

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.260
today is capable of
working with them.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:54.650
We just make you go through
the laborious process of

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:55.560
getting it set up.

00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.270
And we want to just remove
all that out of the way.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:03.610
So in many ways, we think that
codenvy.com, the site, will

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:07.760
become a listing of all
the technologies that

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.720
developers are using.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.210
Which one do you want
to get coding with?

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.846
Let's get coding
with that now.

00:59:12.846 --> 00:59:13.940
LOUIS GRAY: Excellent.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.190
ADDY OSMANI: That's awesome,
and I know that there are

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:19.160
probably developers out there
that'll be interested, or very

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.930
willing, at least, to create
some of these templates for

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:25.720
you, if you're open to community
submissions.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:30.780
Another question that I had was
around cloud-based device

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.020
or browser testing.

00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:35.980
So if I create a web app inside
Codenvy, and I want to

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.800
then be able to go and see
how it looks inside other

00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:42.740
browsers, maybe using something
like BrowserStack or

00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.820
[? SophosLabs ?] and so on, is
that something that you've

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:50.020
considered, just making it easy
to launch your current

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.460
app inside something else?

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.400
Or is it something
you'd consider?

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.405
TYLER JEWELL: How interesting
that you brought that up.

00:59:55.405 --> 00:59:57.830
I think halfway through, we
talked about how we've got a

00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:02.710
dozen partners who are signed up
to working in our beta SDK

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.870
[? SophosLabs ?]

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.050
is one.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:11.650
So the vision there is that
very same sort of plug-in.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.900
Plug-in, cross browser testing,
maybe possibly even

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.110
automatically generate the
Selenium script for that

01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:21.710
automatic submission
that's there.

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:24.160
So today, it's code, build,
test for the individual.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.800
But then there's some of these
broader workflows that you can

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.876
incorporate in.

01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:28.550
ADDY OSMANI: That's fantastic.

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.520
TYLER JEWELL: We've got some
other great ones that are

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.200
coming, too.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.940
LOUIS GRAY: It almost sounds
like we need to bring you back

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:36.180
in here not too long from
now for part two.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.990
So what I want to do is thank
you guys for coming in.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.960
It's been an excellent
session.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.520
Really taught us a lot.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.770
Hopefully, Addy, it wasn't
too late for you.

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:44.790
So I appreciate your
jumping in.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:45.155
ADDY OSMANI: Not at all.

01:00:45.155 --> 01:00:47.470
LOUIS GRAY:And joining us,
remotely, from the UK.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:50.740
This really is the power
of being global in live

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.380
interaction with our users.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:54.080
Thank you for all of you
who left comments

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.630
on YouTube and Moderator.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.780
I would encourage everybody who
hasn't known enough about

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.860
Codenvy so far to go to
codenvy.com to find out more.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.280
Sign up, give it a kick, and
I'd love to see more people

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.520
using Chrome OS and other strong
platforms to be coding

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.280
directly on the web.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.310
So thanks again, both Tyler and
Steven, for joining me.

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:16.740
You can join us every
single day at

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.660
