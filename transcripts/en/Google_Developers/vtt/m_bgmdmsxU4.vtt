APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Hey everyone.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.630
My name is Aparna.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.305
I'm a Product Manager
at Google.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.000
I have Roy and Iein with me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
We are from the Knowledge Team
at Google, so this is the

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.240
first time our team is doing
these developer sessions at

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.600
I/O around structured
data and knowledge.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.900
So we hope you like it, and let
us know what you think for

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.430
the next year.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.300
So our talk today is about
bringing relevant information

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.640
from the inbox to the search box
and new experiences like

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.720
Google Now.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.830
How many of you use Google
Now or have tried it?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.340
OK, all right.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.980
And we're going to talk about
how both as users, you can see

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.110
some of the new features we
are building and kinds of

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.740
problems that we are trying to
solve, but also from the

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.500
developer angle.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.870
Like I said, we'll start with
the user experience.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.760
We'll give you a sense of the
user problems we're trying to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.330
solve, features we're building,
maybe throw in a few

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.070
demos, and then switch gears
and say, OK, how can you as

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.050
developers be part of
this experience?

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.220
How many of you attended the
keynote yesterday morning?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.950
How many of you saw
the search, the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.310
conversational search?

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.910
How many of you thought
it was not bad?

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.580
Really good?

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.650
OK.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.600
So you saw Amit and Johanna
give you a glimpse of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.300
future of search and
where we are going.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.730
And in this talk, I'll go a
little bit deeper and show you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.780
some of these examples of how
we are pushing the edge in

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.670
terms of saying, look, the
future of search is being

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.090
conversational and
an assistant.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.420
So for the next few moments, I'm
going to treat this half

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.470
of the room as my user
half and this half as

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.010
my developer half.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.170
So a quick question
to the user half.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.880
How many of you look
for information

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.515
in your emails often?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.660
And question for the
developer half.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.880
Do you send information to
your users, important

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.750
information, in the emails--

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.050
confirmations, notifications,
stuff that you

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.300
want them to remember?

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.520
So here's the problem.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.690
You guys are sending information
to these guys, but

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.810
then what's happening is this.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.259
So is the person next to you, so
is that guy behind you, and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.190
that woman in the back, she's
sending email too.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.480
And before you know it, these
guys are getting flooded with

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.470
all of these emails and
important information, but

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.560
it's really impossible for you
to find that one single

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.520
nugget, one single answer, one
single piece of information

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.850
that you need at the
time you need it.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.560
And to make it really concrete,
let me give you a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.070
specific personal example.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.750
So this morning I woke up, I
had one simple question.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.650
What hotel am I staying at?

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.145
So you see I have a flight
coming up tomorrow morning, an

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.660
early morning flight, and I
have this talk, and I have

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.050
another event this evening.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.140
I figured I should just stay
the night in the city.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.680
So I wanted to mention my hotel

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.090
information to my husband.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.980
It took me five steps just
to get to that answer.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.320
So first step, you can't see
this here, but I'll talk you

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.950
through it.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.800
The first step is I had to
actually swipe past all these

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.550
goddamn apps on my phone
and then open Gmail.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.040
The second step, I had to map
the natural question that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.920
popped up in my head.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.180
I had to say, what hotel
am I staying at?

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.460
And then turn this into this
robotic set of keywords that I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.330
thought Google could
understand.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.890
So I had to say, OK, maybe I
should say "hotel" and the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.140
provider that actually
sent me that email.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.840
That's the second step.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.680
And then third step, I basically
had to say, well,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.590
now I have to make sure that I
peck at my keyboard and type

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.470
these queries on a tiny device,
and make sure that I'm

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.040
not doing any typos because it's
a pain to type it again.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.090
Fourth step, then I see a bunch
of these email results.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.590
They all look the same, and I
have to make a guess and say,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.440
maybe one of these emails
has an answer.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.230
Then comes the final step and
say, OK, I click open the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.280
email, wade past all the
information, all the words

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.970
that I don't quite need, just to
get that one single answer

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.560
which says, it's the
Marriott next door.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.010
Five steps just to get
to that answer.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.430
We think it should be much
easier, and those of who saw

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.170
the keynote know that one of the
ways that we want to make

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.370
it easier is say, you
ask a question--

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.730
in fact, you speak your
mind to the phone--

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.000
and we get you the answer.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.089
One single step.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.520
Because by the time I'm done
with these five steps this

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.430
morning, my husband was on the
fifth page of Hacker News.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.920
I want it to be in
one single shot.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.800
So we said, OK.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.130
This morning, I came in and
said, team, we must fix this.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.180
And in the last few hours,
we've basically solved

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.030
everything.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.280
Kidding, of course.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.740
If you think about it, going
from a question to an answer

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.850
in one step requires us to be
solving really hard problems

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.800
from the technical side.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040
First hard problem we'll
have to solve is speech

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.850
recognition, understanding
what you're

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.300
saying to the phone.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.090
The second hard problem we'll
have to solve is understanding

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.010
natural language.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.260
It's hard enough to
understand speech.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.040
Then we have to add
natural language.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.400
And then the third hard problem
we have to solve is

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.730
semantic understanding, or
understanding structure enough

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.660
to say, when you say, what hotel
am I staying at, we mean

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.260
that there's a hotel, there's
a name to the hotel, and

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.450
there's an address, and
there's a phone

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.090
number and so on.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.910
Very structured information.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.440
These are hard problems, but
I'd much rather let Google

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.640
solve these hard problems
than me as a user.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.640
Like I said, speech, natural
language, structured data

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.960
understanding.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.710
Now, why is it an important
problem to solve?

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.030
If you think about it, during
the course of a typical day--

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.080
not a day that you're at Google
I/O, a typical day--

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.360
you have lots of questions,
and you want fast answers.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.330
Imagine if each of these
questions took several steps,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.510
you'd be spending a lot of time
just futzing around with

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.670
the data that you have.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.220
And you see some of these
questions here.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.070
Some of these questions are
coming from our Knowledge

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.090
Graph, and they can be answered
from the Knowledge

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.430
Graph that we're building.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.840
And if you attended some of
the structured data talks

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.440
earlier today, you know we're
investing in building out this

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.200
Knowledge Graph, understanding
things, understanding

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.660
places, and so on.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.850
500 million entities
and growing.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.910
But then, not all answers
come from that, right?

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.920
So some of these answers
do come from your own

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.940
information, let's say your
emails or your calendar.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.150
And we want to be able to help
you go from the question to

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.070
answer in one step for those
answers as well.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.810
In some cases--

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.420
not all cases, but in some
cases, when the context is

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.850
right, in fact, we actually
shouldn't even have to wait

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.560
for you to ask that question.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.310
You have a special order that
you're waiting for, or you

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.490
just ordered it and
that shipped.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.930
You should just be able to say,
look, the package that

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.980
you're waiting for has shipped,
and this is Google

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.040
Now for those of you who
are trying it out.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.450
Let me actually switch gears to
a demo so we can actually

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.400
show some of these in action.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.435
I'm going to first dare the
Wi-Fi gods here and see if we

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:13.040
can pull it off, the Voice
Search on a phone.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.930
So as I mentioned earlier, I
have this flight coming up

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.400
tomorrow morning, and I have a
lunch meeting with a client,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.110
and I just don't want
to be late to it.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.720
So I can say something like,
when is my restaurant

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.970
reservation?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.490
COMPUTER VOICE: You have a
reservation for Agnelini

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.830
Osteria, 1200 hours
PM tomorrow.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.020
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I can
see that I see the restaurant

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.810
reservation right away.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.370
I don't have to futz
with my phone.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.880
The answer comes
up right away.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.790
And then I say, OK, so it's at
12 o'clock, it's not too bad.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:42.510
But then, wait.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.620
When does my flight get there?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.750
So I can ask something like,
when does my flight land?

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.240
COMPUTER VOICE: Virgin America
Flight 1930 from SFO to LAX

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.640
arrives at 9:03 AM tomorrow.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.950
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: I
can hear the answer.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.810
I can also see the answer
right away.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.050
And then say, OK, look, unless
I'm paranoid, I have plenty of

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.770
time to get to the restaurant.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.900
But I am paranoid, so I'm going
to wonder, is there

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.650
traffic between the airport
to the restaurant?

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.180
So I can now say something like,
how far is it from LAX

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.430
to Angelini Osteria?

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.220
COMPUTER VOICE: The drive from
Los Angeles International

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.500
Airport to Angelini Osteria
is 12.6 miles.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.400
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I
can see it's 12.6 miles.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.200
It's 30 minutes, even
in peak LA traffic.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.100
I still have plenty of time.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.520
A couple of things I want to
highlight here in terms of

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.340
what's happening behind
the scenes.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.270
The reason why, from this
question, I could just get to

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.180
the answers in one step is
that Google is able to

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.970
understand when I say "my
flight" or "my hotel," it's

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.040
able to understand based on
the context that, hey, you

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.100
have a flight coming up, you
have a hotel reservation, and

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.350
use that information
to get the answer.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:00.340
The second thing worth noting
here is that each of these

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.410
responses that Google is
giving back is very

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:02.870
structured.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.250
So when you have the restaurant
reservation, it's

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.300
actually telling you the most
important things that you'd

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:12.480
want to know, like what time it
is, where it is, and even

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.430
get directions to get there.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:15.680
Let's try a couple
more things.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:19.790
What's on my schedule
this weekend?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.210
COMPUTER VOICE: You have a
ticket for "Iron Man Three" at

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.360
9:30 PM tomorrow.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:27.870
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
All right.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:31.610
So I can see that I have a movie
that my husband's taking

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.520
me tonight to make up for all
the long hours at work making

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.760
these demos work.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.390
And I can also see again, to
reinforce the point, so when I

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.390
ask this question, what I want
to know are the most obvious

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.620
pieces of information that
I need as a user.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.675
If I have a movie coming up, I
want to know the most obvious

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:51.470
things, which is what time it
is, where it is, and even

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.310
directions to get there, and
we're able to actually present

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.750
that structured information.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.780
I can also see that there's
another event which is just my

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.240
usual regular yoga class
on Saturday.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.720
It's coming from my
Calendar event.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.590
I can also say, oh yeah, I
have this brunch with my

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.670
friends, again, like
where and when.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.530
And I can say, oh yeah, there's
this event invitation

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.905
that I have for somebody's
birthday at my neighbor's.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.960
This is a multiscreen
experience.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.480
I just showed you on the phone,
I can speak these

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.710
questions and get an answer on
the phone, because usually

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:28.510
that's where you are
on the go, you want

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:29.870
the questions answered.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.560
But I could just as well type
it in or even speak on the

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.330
laptop or desktop here.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.750
In fact, why don't I actually
switch gears and show you a

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.840
couple examples just so you
know this is available

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.790
anywhere on Google.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.120
So here I have my laptop.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.070
I'm signed in.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:56.740
I could say something like,
I could just type in.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.420
And I see the same answer.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.180
Because I typed in, I just see
the answer as a result.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.500
Notice that I actually said a
slightly different thing.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.080
I said, "when does my flight
leave," versus "when does my

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.840
flight land," and Google is
able to understand that.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.770
I could also, again, speak
this on my laptop.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.695
I could basically say, when
does my flight leave?

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.360
Let me try that again.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.280
OK, Google.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.530
When does my flight leave?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.010
COMPUTER VOICE: Virgin America
flight 1930 from SFO to LAX

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.180
leaves at 8:00 AM tomorrow.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.330
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: And
so you notice that I can

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.830
basically speak to Google on
the laptop or on the phone.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.300
I could also type it in.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.990
Let me show you another
example.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:55.860
I can basically say something
like, "my reservations."

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.930
And so right away, you see I
have a hotel reservation

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.050
coming up, the very one that I
was talking about earlier.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:04.170
And again, I see all the
information that I need to be

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.930
able to act on that
information.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.620
I have the restaurant
reservation coming up.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.990
And I can type this in, and
again, Google understands when

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.120
I say "my," what do I mean when
I say "my reservations"

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.440
or "my hotels" and so on.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.130
Let's switch gears.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.590
So if you're a developer,
around this time, you're

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.750
thinking maybe a
couple things.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.700
One, as a user, how
can I get to play

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.310
with these new features?

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.770
These are opt-in experiences
that we are actually building,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.690
and we're building features
on top of it.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.440
So at the end of the talk, I'm
going to give you instructions

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.340
on how to get in on the field
trial as a user on the how do

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.940
I actually ask Google for
information about myself,

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.240
about my own world?

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.460
Those of you who haven't tried
Google Now, you can actually

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.210
go to the Play Store and
download it and see some of

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.910
these contextual cards show up
as well so that you don't even

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.340
have to search for these.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.920
On the day of the stay, you
should just get the hotel

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.660
information.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.520
But as a developer, you're
wondering the other thing,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.620
which is, if this is the new
Google, how can I be part of

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.150
this experience, and where
do you fit in here?

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.380
And here's the question that's
the most obvious one, which

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.070
is, you have all these
unstructured pieces of

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:24.020
information, and we need to be
able to turn these into really

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.430
structured answers.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.630
And how does that happen,
and how do

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.130
developers be part of it?

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.390
And this is where email
markups come in.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.820
The idea is very simple.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.510
So for each of these use cases--
let's say the flight

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.230
or the hotel or the events--

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.250
we're saying, OK look.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.340
For the user, these are the five
or six or 10 pieces of

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.640
information that are
really important.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.180
So let's define a schema, a
vocabulary, for each of these

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.320
use cases and say, OK, for a
flight, we should be able to

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.470
define these particular
fields.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.660
And you as the developer can
simply mark up the emails that

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.570
you already send your users and
say, this particular piece

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.130
of information is a passenger
name, this particular thing is

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.515
a reservation number,
and so on.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.780
For a flight, for example, as a
user, I might type in, "when

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.710
is my next flight," and I want
to see the most basic pieces

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.180
of information.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.380
The most obvious thing I just
want to know is which airline

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.830
am I flying on and what
flight number it is.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.470
Some of the other pieces of
information I might want is

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.450
what time it is departing so
I'm not late, where it is

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.180
departing from, which airport,
and the same thing on the

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.230
landing side.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:40.410
What airport is it landing at,
and what time it's landing at.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.790
So on the right hand side here--
so left hand side is

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.830
what the user sees, and on the
right hand side, what you see

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.700
here is a very simple data
model, a schema, that says,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.360
look, these are the pieces of
information that you want your

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.700
users to see so you can define
and you can basically mark up

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.750
your email along these
pieces of the schema.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.510
So you have reservation number,
you have the flight

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.620
number, you have the airline's
name, departure time, arrival

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.850
time, and so on.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.110
Really simple.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.450
But this is for a flights
use case.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.610
For a different type
of use case, like

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.860
an event, for example.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.780
It'll take some time to load.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.040
So let's say you
have an event.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.820
Again, the user comes
into Google.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.730
They can say, when is
the Giants game?

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.690
And we know, for example, that
they have a Giants game coming

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.160
up, and we can show the
structured answer here.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.520
And if you see that answer,
again, the most important

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.080
pieces of information, what time
it is and where it is.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.850
That's it.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.020
So the right hand side, you
again have the most basic

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.040
pieces of information that you
as a developer can simply mark

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.570
up against information
you send.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.830
When does it start and what's
the name and where is it?

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.335
This is for an events
use case.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.080
Another one would be a hotel,
which we'll go into detail

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.520
with Roy's hands-on demo here.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.770
Loading.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.930
So another one can be a
restaurant reservation where

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.730
again, the basic pieces
of information.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.010
Again, we start with the user
experience and say, what are

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.760
the pieces of information you as
a user would want, and then

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.050
work backwards and say, what
should be the fields in the

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.460
schema that you as a developer
should add?

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.600
Now, these are just an initial
subset of use cases that we

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.570
started out with.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.980
Because we said, OK, we want
to start helping users, and

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.130
the most obvious pain point
we saw was travel.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.480
Instead of futzing around with
the phone, we really wanted to

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.970
say, OK, through Google Now and
through these answers, we

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:43.550
want to start helping
the users.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.300
But this is not the
comprehensive set here.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.570
And I think this is one thing
where your inputs, your

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.250
creativity, your ideas would
be really useful, and we're

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.930
hoping that we can actually set
aside some time today to

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.210
discuss those.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.060
What would be your example
of a use case?

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.300
What are some things that you
share information, that you

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.810
send information to users and
you don't want it lost in the

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.890
mix, gathering dust
in the inbox?

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.930
And how can we pick those
examples-- define the schema,

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.829
define the vocabulary
for those examples--

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.205
and then start building
new features?

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.700
So these are some really early
partners that we've actually

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.930
been working with in terms of
implementing markups, where

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.079
they're able to go from
unstructured information that

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:31.060
they send their users today to
these structured answers and

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:34.180
Google Now cards in
one single step.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.070
Once they mark up these emails--
and we even have

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.010
tools that can help
with the markup--

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.870
and once they're able to do
the markup, they're done.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.220
And what happens is the rest
of the hard work, they're

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.330
leaving to Google.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.070
Bringing up this information
at the right time, doing

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.570
speech recognition, doing
natural language

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.900
understanding, the grunt
work there can be

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.460
dealt with by Google.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.020
All you have to do as a
developer is basically take

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.450
the information you send already
and mark it up with

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.220
these basic pieces of
information, and you're done.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.220
Now, I'm going to ask Roy to
actually walk you through a

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.930
couple of these examples, just
so you get a sense of how to

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.370
get started on these
as a developer.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.040
Roy?

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.350
ROY LIVINE: Thanks, Aparna.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.010
So let's say that you're an
online travel agency, and you

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.030
would like to get reservation
information available to users

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.830
through Google Now or through
answer in search.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.230
So let's walk through the
process that booking.com, an

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.890
early adopter of our platform,
would have to go through if

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.440
they did this markup today.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.770
So earlier this morning in the
Google Tools for Structured

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.420
Data, we introduced a really
new, cool tool called

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.910
Structured Data Markup Helper,
courtesy of these two

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.130
gentlemen in the first row.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.830
So I will use this tool to
walk you through how

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:00.420
booking.com would mark
up their email.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.610
So this is how the
tool looks like.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.900
And as you can see, as Aparna
mentioned, we support four

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.590
different verticals, event
reservation, flight

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.510
reservation, lodging
reservation, and restaurant

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.490
reservation.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.420
Since booking.com sends hotel
confirmation emails, I'm going

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:19.220
to click on the Lodging
Reservation.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.710
So the input for this tool
is basically the

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.580
raw HTML of the email.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.210
Now, I already prepared the
raw HTML of just a random,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.990
regular booking.com hotel
reservation email.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.620
I'll paste it in this box and
click on Start Tagging.

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:48.905
Take a few seconds to load,
more than a few seconds.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.145
Let's just open another page.

00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:10.490
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Blame
it on the Wi-Fi.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.200
ROY LIVINE: Yeah.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.180
AUDIENCE: It's going, Roy.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:14.060
ROY LIVINE: It's going?

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.660
There it is.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.670
OK, let's do it quickly
once again.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:29.080
There you go.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.970
Don't go away, please.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.220
Bear with me.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.740
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Do
you want to hard-wire?

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.990
ROY LIVINE: Yeah, that should
be a good idea.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.810
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
There you go.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.430
ROY LIVINE: OK.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:21.030
So on the left hand side, you
can see what the users see

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.590
when they go to their
Gmail client.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.840
It's just the email.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.020
And on the right hand side, you
see the list of all the

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.350
fields that we support
for markup.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.770
Now, our UI requires some of
the fields, and you can see

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.790
that the tool calls these out.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.620
There are eight or nine
required fields here.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.090
Let me quickly walk you through
the process of marking

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.010
up, and I'll show you
how easy it is.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.480
We'll start with the
reservation number.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.050
That's the first one.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.510
I'll just click on the
reservation number, choose the

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:54.430
right field, and once I click,
you can see that the value is

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:57.600
updated on the right
hand side.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.130
Let's quickly walk through
the rest of the fields.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.560
Lodging name would be San
Francisco Marriott.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.420
Street address.

00:22:09.655 --> 00:22:11.030
AUDIENCE: Can you [? zoom in ?]
a little bit?

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.260
ROY LIVINE: Yeah.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.730
That's a good idea.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.480
How is that?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.730
OK.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.955
The city would be
San Francisco.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.180
State, California.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:47.175
Country and postal code.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.480
Under name, that would be me.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.780
And last is check-in time.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.410
That's it.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.100
So I'll just want to review
these to make sure that I

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.680
didn't forget any of
the fields, and it

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.032
looks like I didn't.

00:23:12.032 --> 00:23:17.010
I'll click on Create HTML, and
what you see here are the few

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.050
lines that you'll have to
add to the top of your

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.360
email, and that's it.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.660
Basically, your markup
is done.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.370
It's as simple as that.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.730
I think it's a good time to
mention that we support two

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.040
kinds of formats.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.590
The traditional HTML we have
been supporting since we

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.090
introduced rich snippets.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:35.260
And also, we decided to support
another format, JSON

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.430
LD, which some people feel
that it's easier to

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.590
understand, easier to implement
and to read.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:45.860
If you do want to use JSON LD,
that's the default here.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:49.540
And if you want to use microdata
HTML, you just have

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.690
to choose it.

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.980
What you see here on the right
hand side is just the raw HTML

00:23:53.980 --> 00:24:01.960
with these few lines of HTML
markup added to the raw email.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.580
There it is.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:09.370
So just to recap, it's super
easy to implement this.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.820
The tool that I just showed
you, the Markup Helper, is

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.280
already available in our
developer website.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.030
And Iein's team also created
a validation tool.

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.860
Once you start to play with the
markup, you can copy the

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.130
markup that you created, paste
it into the Validation Tool

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.030
that's also in our developer
website, and see if you

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.250
actually marked up right.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.650
And if you didn't, it'll tell
you what you did wrong so you

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:34.430
can fix it.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.280
That's really easy.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.910
Literally less than one day of
work for one engineer, and

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.240
this markup is done.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.680
I hope you found it useful.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.523
Thank you, and I'll hand
it over to Aparna.

00:24:47.523 --> 00:24:49.958
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.120
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So this
is the link that Roy was

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.070
talking about.

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.510
I want to step back and recap
what you just saw because I

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.120
think it's a big shift for where
Search is going, and

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.320
it's worth thinking about what
this means for you as users as

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.500
well as developers.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.290
As users, I think the way to
think about this is the future

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.410
of Search is actually going
from questions to

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.130
answers in one step.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:23.260
Behind the scenes, there's a
lot going on, but the main

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.640
point is you shouldn't have to
worry about it as users.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.960
Let Google do the hard
work, and you

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.870
should get your answers.

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:31.630
And these answers, and the
answers that we focused on in

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.950
this session, for sure are for
answers about your own world,

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.960
your own information, but
they're answers from the rest

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.800
of the world from the
Knowledge Graph

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.590
that figure in, too.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.950
I think in the same way, as
developers, what we want to

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.300
try and do is, how can you
actually make sure that the

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.370
information that you're sending
these users today,

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.240
it's lying in their inboxes, how
can we make sure that we

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.710
bring up the relevant
information into the search

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.020
box and into Google Now,
again, in one step?

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.280
So you should leave the rest
of the hard work to Google.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.492
Actually, if you can just do the
markup on the emails that

00:26:02.492 --> 00:26:06.670
you already send users, you're
basically good to go.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.530
I'll leave you with two
concrete next steps.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:13.510
One, as users, if you haven't
tried either Google Now or the

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.080
Search field trial, we have an
opt-in experience where once

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.940
you opt into this experience
at this short link here,

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.370
g.co/searchtrial, you will be
able to basically start

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.770
playing with this and
experimenting with features

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:27.740
that I just demoed.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.640
You should be able to say,
when is my flight?

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.970
What's my schedule?

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.150
Show me emails from my friend.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.370
So examples like that.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.580
And then the second thing, as a
developer, one concrete next

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.420
step is we have actually an
entire developers' website

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.450
dedicated to going through all
of this in detail, all the

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.450
tools and the documentation
on the schema that we've

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.960
developed for these
initial use cases.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.050
But also, we're actually
starting a small pilot program

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.710
to sign up partners.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.210
Some of these partners are
on board, as you saw.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.380
But definitely, sign up to be
part of the program and work

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.130
together with us so that you can
see how to start surfacing

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.310
in Google Now and search.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.750
Thank you.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.150
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So I think
we have maybe time for

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.450
Q&amp;A if you want to raise
any questions.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.820
Otherwise, we're also back
in the Sandbox area where

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.860
Knowledge is, and you can come
talk to us about any of these

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.595
questions in detail.

00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:25.900
And if there's anything you know
from this talk, we love

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.150
answering questions.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:31.105
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:31.105 --> 00:27:33.970
I wonder if you could comment on
the roadmap for new schemas

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:39.420
and whether there's a schedule
of coming schemas.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:39.640
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Sorry.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.880
Can you say that again?

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.820
AUDIENCE: I wonder if you could
comment on the roadmap

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:43.680
for schemas.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.110
Right now, I saw I think
four examples.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:51.010
I think yesterday we saw some
examples of media and music.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.300
Is there a roadmap
for schemas?

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.900
Is there a schedule?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.000
If you could comment on the
plans of the future.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.090
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So the
question was yesterday in the

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.550
keynote, you saw some of these
other examples of your own

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.330
information being very easy,
like one of the specific demos

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.800
we saw was, show me
my pictures from

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.160
New York last year.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.800
And instead of, again, futzing
through albums and albums,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.555
we're just basically doing the
hard look and saying, look,

00:28:17.555 --> 00:28:18.950
here you go.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.840
And today, you saw these other
kinds of examples.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.700
And the question was,
is there a roadmap?

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.370
What's the bigger
picture here?

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.990
The way we think about this
problem, again, is starting

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.660
with the user and saying, what
are the typical daily

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.790
information needs
that a user has?

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.260
Now it turns out, we actually
did a bunch of user studies

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:36.710
around this.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:39.000
We found that some of
these user needs are

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.140
about the real world.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.440
They say basically, how is the
traffic to this place, or

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.100
what's the GDP of
that country?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.510
Is the restaurant open?

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.090
But many of these questions,
what we found from our user

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.660
studies, are about their
own information.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.570
Especially as that information
keeps growing, their need to

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.810
find that information grows.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:00.740
So some of this information
is photos, is media.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.680
Other pieces of information are
in their emails, typically

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.890
events and other travel-related
questions.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.920
There are other verticals
or use cases that we've

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.530
identified, and we're starting
to work on them.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.340
And the reason we've actually
done a field trial of these is

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:17.230
to say, OK, let's put it in
front of our users for the use

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.740
cases that we can start
unlocking and see how the

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:20.260
reaction is.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.610
How do people actually use
this, and how do people

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.670
actually find this information
useful?

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:27.950
So over the next few months and
until the end of the year,

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.680
we're going to start expanding
these use cases.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:34.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.060
So you've showed how we can
register information that's

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.440
later recalled from Google
Now or through the

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.870
Google search tools.

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.290
Are there other interfaces--

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.430
are there programmatic
interfaces-- to allow

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:50.740
developers to be able to pull up
that information that maybe

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.020
was registered by other
applications?

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.270
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: That's
a good question.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:58.500
So the question, as I
understand it is,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.780
look, this is great.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.810
One obvious surface is through
the search tools and Google

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.250
Now, but are there other APIs
for developers to actually

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.900
surface that information?

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.250
I think the way to think about
this is, again, componentizing

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.170
these pieces of information.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:22.770
For example, once Chrome gets
the microphone icon, then

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.230
through the Chrome APIs, you
should basically be able to

00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:27.830
say your own website
should get you the

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.080
capability to do voice.

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.220
And again, you should rely on
Google to do the hard work in

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.560
terms of actually having the
underlying technology, but

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.900
then you should just worry
about the responses that

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.120
you're going to generate
for the user.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.870
So the way I think about the
problem is more, what's the

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.410
most obvious surface where the
users are actually looking for

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.520
this information?

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.460
Start there.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.570
Help them there.

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.790
And then figure out if there
are other places

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.102
that we can help them.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.860
AUDIENCE: So I was interested
in the Schema Helper.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.880
You showed only four helpers
that were specifically tied to

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.310
events and reservations.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.950
Are there any plans of
adding more such

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.340
helpers in the near future?

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:13.640
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yes.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.770
Do you have any ideas on what
kinds of other use cases?

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:17.262
AUDIENCE: For example,
products.

00:31:17.262 --> 00:31:20.470
If you sell products, then you
could send the schema for a

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.110
product on the email.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.320
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yes.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.320
So the question is in the Helper
tool, you saw we had a

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.490
few use cases--

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:30.710
events, hotels, flights,
restaurants.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.540
The question was, well, why
don't we have helpers for

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.500
other use cases?

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.500
This is exactly the kind of back
and forth conversation

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.520
we'd love to have in the
developer community which is,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.030
what are the other use cases?

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.800
Products would be a really
good one, where there's a

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.470
purchase order, for example.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.380
AUDIENCE: So it will work
as a conversation?

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.700
We ask and you develop?

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.660
Or will we have APIs to build
our own helpers and maybe add

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.730
them to the tool?

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.150
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: In the
beginning-- and Justin, feel

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.920
free to jump in here.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.910
MALE SPEAKER: One comment.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.375
I saw before for email-oriented
schemas

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:02.345
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:02.345 --> 00:32:07.086
conditional schemas that are
more [INAUDIBLE] oriented.

00:32:07.086 --> 00:32:08.336
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.006
So we don't have current plans
to open up [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:17.006 --> 00:32:17.998
schema process.

00:32:17.998 --> 00:32:20.974
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:20.974 --> 00:32:24.450
it would be challenging,
but [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.700
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:29.410
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.620
My name is Tim.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.890
Question.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.620
How does it define what
information is shown on the

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.350
main part of the search and
which one is shown on the

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.200
right side?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.640
So for example, if I look for
flight information, it

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.860
currently displays in the main
search area, and some

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.760
information is shown
on the right.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:51.560
And related to that is,
what if you have

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.230
multiple matching results?

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:58.760
So I have multiple flights in
different sites, or it could

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.870
be products or whatever.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.140
How is that being handled?

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.720
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So two
parts to your question.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.500
One is, when do we basically
figure out, how do we figure

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.740
out and what's the logic in
terms of when we bring up the

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.080
information front and
center versus when

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:15.360
we think it's auxiliary.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.330
And what you are referring to is
in fact in the field trial.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.510
For certain queries or certain
questions, we think there is a

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.300
very strong explicit intent.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.350
For example, if you say, "When
does my flight land," I mean,

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.330
there's no question that you're

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:28.800
asking about the flight.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.740
But if you said "Virgin America"
because you wanted to

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.040
basically look up the customer
service number, we don't want

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.660
to get in the way.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.650
Again, this is Google,
this is search.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:40.140
We definitely don't want to be
getting in the way between

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.500
your question and answer, and we
want to be doubly sure that

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.640
we understood the intent
of your question.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.290
So if your question is, when is
my flight, then we'll say,

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:50.500
OK obviously, you're looking for
the flight, so let's give

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.190
you that answer and get
out of the way.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.890
But if your question starts
with "Virgin America" or

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.570
"Virgin America Customer Service
Number," then we think

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.350
that if this information is
helpful, then we basically

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:03.670
give you in the auxiliary
in the right hand side.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.240
But in general, we try to
actually get closer and closer

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.690
to your explicit intent
as much as possible.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.875
And this is where the natural
language helps because when

00:34:12.875 --> 00:34:15.540
you're expressing questions or
queries in natural language,

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.360
there's very little doubt
what you mean.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.030
So for example, if you wanted
to know the customer service

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.449
number, if you're able to say
this to Google, you would.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:26.270
If you're able to say to Google,
what's the customer

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.840
service number of Virgin
America, you would.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.760
And that's hard.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.340
It takes some early steps,
but the natural language

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.889
technology is not
fully there yet.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:40.340
And the other thing you
mentioned was around, how do

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.429
we make sure that the
information is represented?

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:43.850
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.679
I mean, I could have more
than one match.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:50.600
So one example is the data about
contacts you're showing

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.630
on the right side now.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.130
What if you have multiple
matches or multiple

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.110
applications that provide
the same information?

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.580
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Yeah,
and we love that use case

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.310
because it actually
shows off--

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.630
so in fact, in the demo if
you saw, I typed in "My

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.260
Reservations," and I had a hotel
reservation, I had a

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.055
restaurant reservation.

00:35:08.055 --> 00:35:10.550
We showed both of those
because you said, "My

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.370
reservations." Or if you said my
flights, and you're a busy

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.420
bee, and you have five flights
coming up in the next month,

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.960
we basically want to give you
all the information you need.

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.600
And in fact, I can show you how
each of these pieces of

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.310
information, you can expand and
say-- and I can certainly

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.270
show you the link later--

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.720
but expand the information in
place so that you could see

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.370
all the relevant information
about a flight and go on to

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.800
the next one and so on.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.410
So the way we basically figure
out is based on the query that

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.110
you have-- if you said "My
flight tomorrow," it'll give

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.260
you just that.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.410
But if you said "My flights
next month," then we

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.090
understand that and say
here, all of it.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:47.340
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:49.610
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.550
Just another quick one.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.360
So you mentioned about multiple

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.350
events around something.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.380
What about events that
change information?

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.300
My reservation changes,
things like that.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:03.180
How do I, as a developer, go
back and update it so I'm not

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.540
having outdated information
shown to users?

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.550
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: That's a
really good point because I

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:14.920
think in all of these use cases,
reservations or events,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.340
and that's precisely why
markup is helpful.

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:20.950
So once you actually give the
email and you're able to mark

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.910
up the updated email that you
send the users, we're able to

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.040
figure it out and say, OK, this
is obviously the latest

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:26.720
information here.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.710
ROY LIVINE: So if you think
about it, our API is actually

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.470
the emails that you're
sending out.

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.560
If you want to update the
reservation, just send an

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.070
email, and we will do all
the heavy lifting.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.280
We'll understand that this
is actually the previous

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.500
reservation if you provide the
confirmation number, and then

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.750
we will be able to update
the card in Search

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.090
and in Google Now.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:47.640
So really, the emails
are your APIs.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.460
AUDIENCE: So the assumption is
that that should be taken care

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.980
of as long as we have sent some
sort of a follow-up tied

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.780
to some kind of key?

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.200
ROY LIVINE: Exactly.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:56.970
And you mark up.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.140
You'll have to mark up so that
we can understand and dedupe.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.940
AUDIENCE: So this is maybe a
different kind of use case.

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.300
At one point, Google, I think,
had a tool that would index

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.670
all the information on my
computer because you can't

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.570
remember all the stuff
that's in there.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.000
And I don't know whether that
tool even still exists, but I

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.030
wind up keeping things in my
inbox as a reminder of things

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.600
I need to do.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:35.570
Or I even send myself emails
just to remind me of something

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:40.400
to do or to keep track of a
small piece of information

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.380
that otherwise would be lost.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:47.590
Because at least if it's in my
Gmail, I can search on it.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:52.940
But for instance, I can't find
that out if I'm away from

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.650
home, and I just
have my phone.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:59.660
But have you ever thought about
that aspect of this?

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.130
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: So there
are two parts to what you're

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.460
asking, and the question or the
topic that you've brought

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.920
up is, my inbox has a
lot of information.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.460
Some of it is very actionable
in terms of the information

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.430
that I need for a flight, but a
lot of it is just my backup

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.580
to my brain, just information
that I've sent there, and I

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.080
know it's safe, and I know
it's in the inbox.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.590
It won't go away.

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.080
I could come back to it.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.430
Are we doing anything
better there?

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:25.710
So there are two parts here.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:28.340
One is if you have attended
the other talk we had

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:32.770
yesterday around actions and
inbox, so one of the things

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.940
we're trying to make is make
the inbox more alive.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.880
So for example, don't
let the to do list

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.030
gather dust in the inbox.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.980
Actually resurface it at
a time that's most

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:43.940
appropriate to you.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.640
The second part of it is, in
fact, we just launched a new

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.470
version of Google Now yesterday
in the latest

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.300
release of the client,
and we have a

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.900
feature called Reminders.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.120
And the idea is really simple.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.540
You should be able to tell
Google, hey, remind me to call

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.395
mom when I get home, and have
that be surfaced as

00:39:01.395 --> 00:39:02.870
a Google Now card.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.350
And down the line, we want to
be able to actually use

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.650
information, again, in your
inbox because you told us

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.930
that's important, and use that
to, again, resurface good,

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.355
actionable to do lists for
you in Google Now.

00:39:16.025 --> 00:39:18.440
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of an ordeal to

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.990
give myself that reminder.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.660
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA:
Right, exactly.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.530
You shouldn't have to.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.780
Yes, exactly.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:32.940
Last question.

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.540
Make it good.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.920
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
about attachments.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.650
So a lot of us have attachments,
text documents,

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.010
that have information that we
want to look for, but the mail

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.130
would just have an attachment,
and there's no way--

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.110
I would need to figure out a
good keyword to look for that

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:53.090
mail, remember who that person
sent that mail to search for a

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.530
keyword that's in
the attachment.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.610
So is there work?

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.430
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: We don't
have anything at this point,

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.730
but I think definitely, that's
one of the things we do see is

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.190
that a lot of the information is
actually in these auxiliary

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:07.780
parts of the email,
and we should be

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.890
able to actually surface.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.560
And the way to think about this
is we just don't want the

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.490
work to be in your head and
make it easy for you to

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:19.075
actually pretty much give us a
few shorthands saying, OK, who

00:40:19.075 --> 00:40:20.340
is this from?

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.440
What is this about?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.590
And then we should
do the hard work.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:23.800
AUDIENCE: Just show
some metadata.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.890
That will make it easier for the
user to search for things.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.820
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: Nothing
yet, but definitely something

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.700
we're thinking about.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:34.290
APARNA CHENNAPRAGADA: We're out
of time, but again, we're

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:35.210
in the Sandbox area.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.770
Any questions, thoughts, ideas
around new use cases, come

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:38.070
talk to us.

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:38.670
Thanks.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.920
