[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.520
PETE LEPAGE: Well,
hello everybody.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.960
I am Pete LePage.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.130
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.345
And today I'm joined by Paul
Kinlan in our London office.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.240
PAUL KINLAN: Hey, guys.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.070
PETE LEPAGE: Hey, Paul.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.192
How you doing?

00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:25.116
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I'm good.

00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:25.578
Thank you.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:26.040
Good, good, good.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.640
PETE LEPAGE: Excellent

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.740
PAUL KINLAN: Had
yesterday off.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.482
Now I'm back at work.

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.690
It's exciting times.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.830
PETE LEPAGE: Very nice.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.490
So today we want to about one
of the new Chrome Apps APIs,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.455
the System Info API.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.400
The System Info API lets you
access information about the

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.390
system, things like the number
of CPUs, the CPU usage,

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.450
memory, hard drive
storage space.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.290
There's a couple of new ones
coming that we'll talk a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.750
little bit about, including
display settings

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.700
and things like that.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.150
These are experimental APIs.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
So right now, they're under the
experimental namespace.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.940
So as you're playing with them,
keep in mind that they

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.630
may change.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.980
In fact, Paul you had mentioned
the display one.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.130
I hadn't found that earlier,
but you found it, right?

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.770
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I was
searching through the Docs

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.200
site that we've got where
I was looking for--

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.850
because we don't necessarily
always link to the latest

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.260
trunk at the moment from
the documentation.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.155
So I was looking through the
search, and the search turned

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:28.370
up display settings.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.620
And I was like, that's not
linked from anywhere.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.110
So it's like so early on
it's kind of exciting.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.330
So we're finding more APIs as
they come along, as well.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.290
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, so the
documentation link is up there

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.980
on the screen, so you can go
have a look at the couple of

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.450
things that are documented
right now.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.840
There are two pieces that are
definitely there documented.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.170
There's a third one that we'll
talk about in our demo today

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.410
that's not documented.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.590
And I'll explain a little
bit about that one.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.440
But let's jump in and have
a quick look at the demo.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.660
If we could bring
my screen up.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.890
I'm going to bring up this
little app that I wrote

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.490
earlier today.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.770
And we'll link to the source
code here in a little bit, but

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.700
for now I'll just show you a
couple of things that are

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.560
available through the
System Info API.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.540
So first off, you can get
information about the system

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.200
architecture.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.010
So what type of CPU is in there,
what the model is.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.880
So you can see on my Mac that
I'm running here, I've got a

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.610
Core i7 running at about two
gigahertz with eight

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.540
processors.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.870
I was trying this earlier on
a Chromebook to make sure

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.620
everything worked OK, and
I got a different set of

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.890
information here.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.160
So you can see what's going
on within the processor.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.490
I also can get the CPU usage.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.990
So I know how much of my
CPU is being used.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.981
Right now, the computer's not
really doing a whole heck of a

00:04:51.981 --> 00:04:55.230
lot, so you can see that my
numbers are nice and low here.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.110
Next piece is the memory
information.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.140
Memory information--

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.980
I've just got this set
statically right now.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.550
But it's showing me that the
available memory that I've got

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.820
on my computer, the maximum
capacity, and how much is

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.320
left, how much is
not being used.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.170
So you can see I've got
about 8 gigs of

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.140
memory in this computer.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.980
I'm using about 5 and
1/2, I think.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.860
So I've got about
2 and 1/2 left.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.020
And then, finally, the third one
is the storage capacity.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.910
And this goes off and lists the
number of hard drives that

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.550
you have available, the total
capacity of the hard drive,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.620
and the available space.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.370
So those are the three pieces.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.610
And then as Paul mentioned,
there's also the display

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.720
capabilities.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.040
The display capabilities I
didn't get in here because

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.690
we're pretty sure
it just landed.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.280
We can have a look here in a
minute and see if it's in

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.920
Chromium or where it is.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.690
But let's take a look
at the code and see

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.150
how this is all working.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.260
So I'm going to bring
up the sample.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.905
And you can see on the screen
right now there's a link to a

00:06:09.905 --> 00:06:11.170
GitHub repository.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.880
This is the link to the
repository that I wrote

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.730
earlier this morning.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.070
You can also go get
the one out of the

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.110
Chrome Apps sample directory.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.500
That one, the code on it, Paul,
you described it well.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:37.270
It's maybe not the best sample
code to use, because sample

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.690
code really should be written
reasonably well and follow

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.640
best practices, and
this may be--

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.190
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, we need
to get that one fixed.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.170
I'll take full responsibility
in the fact that I actually

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.230
merged that one in.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.520
So basically, this actual
system info API has been

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.810
worked on by some of
the guys at Intel.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.670
And basically, it landed, and we
didn't have any samples for

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.580
it, so I went asking
to do samples.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.820
Yeah, I was in a
bit of a rush.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.330
And I checked it, it looked
OK, it worked.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.355
And then we came back to it
today to say we're going to

00:07:09.355 --> 00:07:12.710
show developers'
best practices.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.380
Let's show them something
really cool.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.180
And it needs a little
bit of work.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.782
It's actually a great sample,
it's probably not the best one

00:07:18.782 --> 00:07:20.600
to show off live.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.760
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, so
we'll take a look.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.350
Here's the code for the one that
I wrote, which is up and

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.250
available on my GitHub
repository.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.960
But there's a couple of
things in here that

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.740
I'll just point out.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.090
It's just sort of
standard HTML.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.450
I've got some tables in here for
some of the data so that,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.480
for example, if you've got
multiple hard drives, we want

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.940
to be able to have multiple
hard drives listed.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:51.060
Have a look at my main JS, so
this is the place that brings

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.710
up the app.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.100
Pretty standard stuff here.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.300
We're used to all of these
normal things.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.990
There's one that we don't talk
about a lot, and I'd like to

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.990
toss this one here.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.470
This is one I think is really
useful to toss in is the ID.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.945
If you put an ID into your
Chrome packaged app manifest

00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:12.810
on the onLaunched call, what
that does is that'll help

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.720
Chrome remember where
that window is.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.630
So if you close the window and
reopen it, or if you resize

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.580
it, it'll come back
to the same place.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.480
If you don't put it in there,
it's not going to reopen to

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.916
the same place.

00:08:23.916 --> 00:08:25.750
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, the other
cool thing to point out about

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.480
that as well, it also acts
as a singleton as well.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.456
So in theory, you can't open
any more windows now that

00:08:30.456 --> 00:08:32.880
you've returned and referenced
the original window, if you're

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.390
trying to open the same
window twice.

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:34.880
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, perfect.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.580
OK.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.419
PAUL KINLAN: It's only
relatively recently that came

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:37.870
in as well.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.200
So it's kind of cool.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.400
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.130
PAUL KINLAN: It's kind
of nice, as well.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.320
PETE LEPAGE: Excellent.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.960
So in the manifest, manifest
is pretty much the standard

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.590
manifest that we're used
to looking at.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.460
But there's one thing that I
added in here, and that's the

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.530
experimental API permission.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.150
Because right now, like
I said, this is under

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.360
experimental, so we need to make
sure that we are asking

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.790
for experimental.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.690
That does mean you can't
upload this to

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.510
the Chrome Web Store.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.810
I tried to upload it earlier
thinking, huh, let's see if I

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.440
can get it up there so that you
guys could download it and

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.690
play with it as we're
talking about it.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.030
And I was thinking, well, maybe
because I'm a Googler I

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.640
can get it in.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.570
Yeah, no.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.770
And, of course, my pet peeve, it
doesn't tell you until you

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:20.880
go to hit Publish.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.230
And then it's like, ah!

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.580
[MOCKING LAUGH]

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.100
So, in any event, you need to
ask for the experimental

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.480
permission.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.770
So let's go have a look at the
code that we've got in here.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.630
I've just taken the system info,
created a variable that

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.220
I've shortened down to the
chrome.experimental.systemInfo

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.090
API just so that I would save a
little bit of typing and all

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:45.350
that kind of stuff.

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.640
And on my ("document").ready,
I go do a couple of things.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.520
So I call updateCPU,
updateMemory, and

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.550
updateStorage.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.550
We'll have a look at
those in a sec.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.660
And then I added a listener.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.160
So, like I said, there are
three different APIs

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.130
that you can call.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.350
So systemInfo.cpu.get
will go and get the

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.860
information about the CPU.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.190
Let's take a dive into that
right off the bat.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.230
So I just do a console log so
we can see what's going on,

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.840
but I say CPU architecture
is CPU dot

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.770
architecture name, or archName.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.190
The model is just the model
and number of processors.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.620
And that's basically all that
we get back when we ask for

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.420
the GET for the CPU Info API.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.270
So we get three parameters
back--

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.395
the model, the architecture, and
the number of processors.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.690
The second one is memory.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.530
And memory gives you the amount
of available memory

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.360
that you have on your
computer and the

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.330
amount of total memory.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.500
So if we go and have a
look at updateMemory.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.370
So systemInfo, memory.get.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.280
And again, like most Chrome
packaged apps APIs

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.090
it uses a call back.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.960
So updateMemoryInfo, so if we
go to updateMemoryInfo, sure

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.000
enough, here it is.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.170
We've got a couple of things in
here that I'll point out.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.780
So, again, I just do that
console log because I always

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.820
like to see when I'm debugging
things what's going on.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.450
I say Math.round
memory.capacity, which is the

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:34.170
total capacity of my memory,
divided by 1024 by 1024, so I

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.720
can get it in megabytes, because
it gives you the

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.550
information back in bytes.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.660
And then I just tack
on some megabyte.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.730
And, again, same thing here
for the second line,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:49.620
memory.availablecapacity gives
me the available capacity--

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.290
the amount of memory left.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:56.030
So if we go and pop over,
here we go, let's

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.400
bring this guy up.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.530
PAUL KINLAN: Does the memory
information update in real

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.830
time or is there a gap?

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.190
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
a good question, Paul.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.930
Memory information does not
update in real time.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.590
In fact, unless you specifically
add an event

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.360
listener, and we'll talk about
where you can do that in a

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.310
sec, none of these update
in real time.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:19.440
It's just a single "get this
piece of information and do

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.000
something with it." So the
CPU information, memory

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.180
information, and the list of
hard drives that you have

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.140
available on your computer
are all just based on

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.110
a single GET request.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.500
So you can see here that I've
got the eight and that.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.260
So let's go back over to the
code here for a sec.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.260
So then the third one we've got
is updateStorage, so if we

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.770
have a look at updateStorage.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.820
Again, same thing, notice it's
systemInfo.storage.get and,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.210
again, that callback that goes
and does the callback.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.410
So if we go and look at
updateStorageInfo and have a

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.270
quick peek at that.

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.690
Again, for the storage info,
what I'm doing is basically

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.620
creating a bunch of
rows in my table.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.040
So I go and grab my table body,
go through each of the

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.530
drives that I've got, and add
something for the drive ID,

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.230
for the drive type, the drive
capacity, and the drive

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.860
available capacity.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.400
Now, one of the things you're
going to want to do when you

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.280
play with this as you look
around at some of these is

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.520
test this on a couple of
different platforms.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.020
This is experimental right now,
so you want to try it in

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.040
a couple of different places.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.100
Once we get this out of
experimental, I don't think

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.790
you're going to need
to do that.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.010
The reason why I say you need
to check this is today the

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.890
storage info, if you request
that on a Chrome OS or a

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.255
Chromebook, it returns undefined
there because while

00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:57.460
the machine has a hard drive and
storage space, it doesn't

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.120
really have the storage space in
the same way that we think

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.050
about storage space
on a regular

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.710
laptop or other device.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.400
And as we move into looking at
how some of these apps run on

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.450
mobile devices, whether that's
a tablet, a phone, again,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.190
that's going to be something
a little different.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.570
So you're going to need to
handle a couple of different

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.530
behaviors in here on some
of these things.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:23.740
Go ahead, Paul.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.720
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I was going
to say just a note as well.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.850
The [? type ?] can include
removable, as well.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.470
So you can have removable
storage, so if it's a USB

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.316
drive, [INAUDIBLE] understand
whether

00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:35.940
that's attached or not.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.714
I'm yet to actually see
that working though.

00:14:37.714 --> 00:14:39.045
But that's not to say it
doesn't, because I haven't put

00:14:39.045 --> 00:14:40.400
the USB drive in.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.125
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, so I tried
that earlier today with a CF

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:47.310
card and inserted and
removed a CF card--

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.560
and let me just bring up
the sample again here.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.260
Notice how here it says
"harddisk." When I inserted a

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:00.470
CF card and refreshed, it
said "removable." But,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:05.400
unfortunately, the API didn't
come back and automatically

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.310
say, hey, there's something
new there.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.040
Now, that's kind of OK
because right now--

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.810
remember this was just that
single, one-time GET.

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:17.420
If I did another GET,
it would show up.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.950
So there was no notification
because I wasn't listening for

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.340
anything at the time.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.460
PAUL KINLAN: That's kind of
interesting [? enough ?] to me

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.380
because obviously we've got
the Media Gallery API, and

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.960
right now we don't have a device
attached to them, which

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.040
I think would be really
cool to have.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.530
I know we were talking about
it a while ago, especially

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.410
with the [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.000
It'd be nice to have a device
attached to them.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.990
And in lieu of that, you could
basically look through the

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.270
types of devices that
are attached.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.160
Removable can say, hey, look
you've attached removable

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.410
storage, if you want to go and
scan the pictures, at least.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.760
And then you can hook
that in with the

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.230
Media Gallery API then.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.520
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly, exactly.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.380
PAUL KINLAN: It seems like
a pretty nice way

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.250
to work around that.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:54.940
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.600
Yeah, and I don't think
it would be a

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.400
terribly hard thing because--

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.700
I'll pop into this right
now, if I pop

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.950
back over to the code--

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.707
if you have a look, I've got
this systemInfo.cpu.o

00:16:09.707 --> 00:16:10.957
nUpdated.addListener.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.310
So this says, hey, any
time the CPU is

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.070
updated, add an event.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.400
There's a similar event for
storage that you can say, hey,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.700
I want to listen for changes
in my storage

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.320
drive available size.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.080
Now, I don't have that
one in here.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.240
Though, let me actually bring up
a place where we do have it

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.700
so that you can just see.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.930
Again, this is in the sample
that is up in the GitHub

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.730
repository for the team.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:55.330
And you'll see here in a sec
why this is a little bit

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:55.940
frightening.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:59.000
But startMonitor, so we
do systemInfo.stora

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.480
ge.onAvailableCa
pacityChanged.addListener so

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.569
that you can go in and say,
hey, I want to be able to

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.050
listen for changes
to the available

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.109
drive capacity changes.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:15.591
PAUL KINLAN: When does
that change?

00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:19.950
I mean, is that when you format
a drive or something?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.630
PETE LEPAGE: That event fires
any time that the available

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.880
hard drive space changes.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.600
Now, that could mean maybe you
saved a file to the disk.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:36.850
Maybe the system has written
something in terms of like

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.440
some other app's saved to
disk, your paging files

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.590
changed size.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.180
So it's not the most useful
thing right now because it's

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:48.650
going to fire left, right,
center, up, down, three ways

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.240
until Sunday.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.090
As I was just writing some of
this app earlier, it was like

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.650
changing seven times.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:02.310
So maybe not the most useful
thing, but still good to have.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.090
So you can see here I've also
added a system info on updated

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.110
add listener for the
CPUUsageChanged.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.580
And that's going to fire every
time the usage on the CPU

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.380
changes, so if I may be using
more CPU for processing or

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.430
something like that.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.840
And that's why you get these
values here are changing.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.220
So if I inspect this element,
and will have a look at the

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.550
console here, I don't have this
firing off right now with

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.150
each change.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.270
So let's go and add that
in so that you

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.360
can see what's happening.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.020
So update, update storage.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.390
So here we go.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.470
We've got the onCPUUsageChanged,
I'm just

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.720
going to do a console.log(info).

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.010
And now we'll pop
back over here.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:08.040
If we reload the app, notice
we've got this log fire.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.730
So we get the average
usage, and we

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.210
get a usage per processor.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.560
And that's a list, an array
of the amount of

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.490
usage for each processor.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.960
And I'm just doing a little bit
of math to go and display

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.350
these things.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.720
PAUL KINLAN: Just a quick one,
we've had a question on one of

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.040
the Google+ posts from
Francois Beaufort.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.492
What does Chrome OS is not the
same for storage info?

00:19:41.492 --> 00:19:43.540
Can you ask Pete to elaborate?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.280
PETE LEPAGE: Yes, certainly.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.770
So earlier today when I tried
this on Chrome OS, what I got

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.400
back from the-- let me just
bring up the code here so I

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.650
can show you.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.680
Where is it?

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.887
So here in the updateStorageInfo
method where

00:20:05.887 --> 00:20:07.340
it's the callback--

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.660
so this is where I'm
handling the

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:12.590
different storage devices--

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:19.580
instead of getting back in an
array of the different hard

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:24.220
drives that are available to
me, I got back undefined,

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.550
which Chrome is coming back and
saying, hey, there are no

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.010
hard drives in this computer.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.170
And rather than giving an array
of length zero, it gave

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.620
an undefined.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:40.290
And so right now it's just
not returning anything.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:42.540
Personally, I think that's a
bug, and I think we should be

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.920
returning an array of length
zero if there is no storage

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.825
devices available to
the application.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.750
That's what's going on.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.710
Go ahead.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.210
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I agree.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:57.820
I think it's a bug.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.430
But at the same time, I think
some of the concept behind

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.120
Chrome OS, as well, is that
you should [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:04.710
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.010
PAUL KINLAN: It doesn't
make that much sense.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.810
I don't know what it would be
like if you plugged a USB

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.650
device in, like a
storage device.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.330
Regardless, it seems
like a bug.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.450
Like Pete said, we'd expect
it to return zero, zero

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.320
[INAUDIBLE], for instance.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:22.025
So I think that's to clarify
what Pete was

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:23.010
talking about before.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.390
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:30.600
So if we can actually bring up
the link to Moderator so that

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.830
if people have questions they
can post your questions there

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.780
on Google Moderator.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.270
We'll start taking those
questions here in

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.060
two or three minutes.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:43.170
But the key thing to keep in
mind here is this is a cool,

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.990
easy way to get the information
you need about

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.100
what type of CPU is in the
machine, how busy the computer

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.700
is, how much memory is
available, and how much

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.510
storage space is available.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.020
I think for the most part, the
storage space is going to be

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.480
the most interesting and most
useful to people, because as a

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.180
developer writing an
application, I'm not sure I

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.990
really need or really care what
platform that I'm on or

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.740
necessarily how much memory
is available.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.570
I might want that information
to report back for analytics

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:17.950
or something like that, but
it's not really going to

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.630
change the way that I deal
with a lot of stuff.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.110
One way that I might use it is
determining where I want to do

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.060
some of my processing.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.720
If I'm writing an image-editing
app and I've got

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.350
some pretty heavy processing
that I'm going to do, I might

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.460
push that up to the server
to do if I've

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.940
got a low-end machine.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.770
But that's going to depend on
a couple of other things.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.550
PAUL KINLAN: That's actually
not a bad idea.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.950
It's kind of hard to work out
whether you want to do things

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.520
locally or not, and it's kind
of interesting to see where

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.240
that's going to change with the
number of processes and

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.350
everything.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.620
But, for me, some of the areas
that I'm kind of interested in

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.387
is you might be able to see
when a web worker, for

00:22:59.387 --> 00:23:01.260
instance, that you have gets
pushed on to another thread

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.930
and you can see that it's
not on your main thread.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.030
But from an actual usage, giving
it to users, they might

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.430
want to know how busy
their CPU is.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.630
They're actually insanely
popular

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.720
tools on other platforms.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.040
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
that's true.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.660
PAUL KINLAN: Just
to see how much

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.730
processing is getting used.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.680
I'm always kind of a little
wary because by virtue of

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.000
using the API, it means that
you're using the CPU.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.720
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.390
It's sort of that, well, if
you're going to measure it,

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.800
you're going to affect the
measurement of it.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.910
It's always that fun
little piece.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.380
I think there's a pact.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.510
PAUL KINLAN: I can see a lot of
apps coming out like basic,

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:40.890
nice, HTML-based site, like
storage space site stuff, you

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.730
got the number of CPU processes
you've got.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.325
I mean, there's a whole
load of stuff.

00:23:46.325 --> 00:23:48.640
We haven't even got CPU
temperature in or a whole

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.350
other bit of metrics.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.860
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.800
PAUL KINLAN: I think it's one
of those experimental APIs

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.360
where we want more feedback
about what people want.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.240
I know Intel wanted this
and to see some stuff.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.035
But what do developers want?

00:23:59.035 --> 00:24:01.690
And if you're a developer, what
you want, make sure you

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.540
leave it on [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.580
or leave us a message about
exactly what type of

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.100
information you want
from the system.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.040
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
a good call.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.850
That's a very good call.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.860
So if we can come off the
display and just go to the

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.310
side by side.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.440
Why don't we have a look at some
of the questions and see

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.250
if there any questions in
Moderator so that if people

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.290
who do have any questions, we
can take some of those.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:26.800
While I'm pulling that up, Paul,
is there anything you

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.330
want to add?

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.150
PAUL KINLAN: No, I think it's
basically this is still

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:32.070
experimental.

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.420
We've got the Display API, which
is kind of hidden and

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.990
doesn't seem to be available,
which, again, I think is

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.770
either a bug or it's embedding
Chromium [INAUDIBLE] trunk at

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.580
the moment.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.070
These are actually kind of
interesting, if you've got the

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.080
displays, you want to know how
many displays are on the

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.850
screen, which window--

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.030
well, I'll rephrase it.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.470
The thing I would be kind of
interested in is to be able to

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:57.340
target which window goes on to
what screen, because I don't

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.510
believe we have that capability
at the moment.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.710
But if you can understand the
screens, the display depth and

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.380
the DPI and all that type of
stuff, you let the user have a

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.230
little bit more advanced control
over the layout of

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.330
applications, and you can go
full screen on one top or one

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.320
window or choose to go full
screen on a second window and

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.450
kind of keep the use of that
[INAUDIBLE] to do that.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.190
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
a good point.

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.140
PAUL KINLAN: Which is
what I want to see.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.240
I don't think we're quite there
just yet, but this is

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.023
the whole point of these talks
is for us to tell everyone

00:25:24.023 --> 00:25:25.983
exactly what's going down the
line and tell them how to

00:25:25.983 --> 00:25:27.830
start to play with it
and also how to get

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.790
good feedback as well.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.500
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, cool.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.070
So I just pulled up the
questions, and the

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.300
link is there on--

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.950
hang on.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.200
It's always fun.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.140
It's somewhere.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.020
It's right down there.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.630
See?

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.350
You can see it right there.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:45.290
So the questions are there.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.240
If you've got questions,
feel free to post them.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.570
I want to take one question from
a student at Davidson in

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.010
North Carolina.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.560
It's not completely related to
the stuff that we're talking

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.800
about with the System Info
APIs, but I think it is a

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.010
somewhat interesting question
that definitely you could use

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.050
some of these with
Chrome apps.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.260
And the student wanted to
know, "I'm working on an

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.710
independent research project
where I want to project a lot

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.670
of data, whether university or
hospital locations, economic

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.350
data, onto a map of the US.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.220
What's the best program to use,
and what are some of the

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.590
Google API features that
would meet your needs?"

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:33.330
Well, I think from a Chrome apps
perspective for something

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.130
like this, we run into a couple
of challenges with

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.080
Chrome apps because
unfortunately right now, we

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.540
can't super easily embed maps.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.620
Because the point of Chrome
apps is that they work

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.140
offline, and maps need that
online connection.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.570
You can use a web view to go
and represent and pull in

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.840
those maps, but it won't
work offline.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.970
That's probably the best way to
do this if you wanted to do

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.390
it as a Chrome app, to use
a web view and use

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:06.340
the Google Maps APIs.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.250
And I know that they have
a regular show.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.040
I don't know when they're
show is on.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.500
I think their show may
actually be on in

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.450
about half an hour.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.190
So if you're still
watching, check

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:22.790
developers.google.com/live to
see when the Maps show is.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.350
They can definitely talk a lot
more about how to go and

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:31.720
overlay data and that kind of
stuff onto maps and where to

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.950
get some of this information.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.580
Paul, anything you want
to add to that?

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:38.770
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I mean,
there's a lot of other APIs

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.590
that we've got as well.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.875
And whilst we don't quite have
access to what we know as the

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:46.520
Google Script Loader, where you
do Goog.load and then the

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.240
name of the script, primarily
because we can't

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.100
inject brand new--

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.350
well, we can inject new tags.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.435
But the way that it does it, we
can't have access to that

00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:55.580
at the moment.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.850
But it's actually not too hard
to get access to the API's

00:27:58.850 --> 00:27:59.170
[? expression. ?]

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.140
You can use the identity API,
whether it's the first-party

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.360
or third-party APIs.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.090
PETE LEPAGE: That's true.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.780
PAUL KINLAN: You can just make
normal XML and HTTP requests,

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.850
which are authenticated against
the OAuth token.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.340
It's like two or three
lines of JavaScript.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.900
And while we can make it a lot
easier to do, and we've still

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.430
got to work on that side of
things, you can still use that

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.250
to access all the existing APIs
because pretty much all

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.260
of our API suite is based off
OAuth 2.0 authentication.

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.670
So we have that built into
Chrome applications.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.820
And if you want to go and get
some extra source of the data,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:31.000
whether it's like a reverse
geomap, for instance, or

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.170
reverse geocode, sorry, you can
go and call those API REST

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:37.270
endpoints quite easily.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.380
So that was my answer.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.680
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.460
All right, well it looks like
that's the end of the

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.260
questions for today.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:49.130
So I want to thank Paul for
joining us from London and

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.270
thank you guys for watching.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.130
Hopefully you found
this interesting.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.240
We'll be back again next week,
same time, where we're going

00:28:55.240 --> 00:29:00.800
to dive into some more
Chrome apps APIs.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.780
Definitely go have a look at
developers.google.com/live to

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:09.660
see what our show next week is,
as well as check out our

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:13.650
Plus page at Google
Chrome Developers

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.740
is our name on there.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.870
I'll be posting a short summary
of some of the stuff

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.150
that we talked about today.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.710
So with that, Paul?

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:22.620
Do you have anything else
you want to add?

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.630
PAUL KINLAN: I'm really
excited about the

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.370
next couple of weeks.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.350
I think this was the first,
probably simplest API to kind

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.710
of start to talk about.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:30.520
We've got notifications.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.640
I know people are going to
watch the notifications.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.050
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, the

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.970
notifications are really slick.

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:36.340
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
notifications, push

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.020
messaging--

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.450
PETE LEPAGE: That one's
pretty awesome.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:39.260
PAUL KINLAN: That's
a good one.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.300
What else have we got?

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.170
We've got loads actually.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.390
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we've
got a whole bunch.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.170
In fact, I'll pull
it up right now.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:48.190
PAUL KINLAN: We've got a
minute to spare, right?

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.090
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we've
got a minute.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:56.700
All right, so if I bring up
google.developers.com/live.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.030
It's great, some days at Google,
where you'd think we'd

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.870
have nice, fast internet
connections, we don't always

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.810
have the fastest of internet
connections.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.240
PAUL KINLAN: That's because
you're using it to stream

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.700
video, right?

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:07.870
PETE LEPAGE: Well, yeah,
that's true.

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.850
So next week we're going to
be talking about rich

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:11.660
notifications.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.810
So that's next week,
on the 26th.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.340
The week after, we're going to
be talking about the synced

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.720
filesystem.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.280
Synced filesystem, Paul why
don't you talk about that?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.270
This is one you've been really
excited about for a while.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, this is one
of those ones that we kind of

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.510
need on the web, at least
especially for offline

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.130
applications.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.880
It's the ability to use an API
that is basically exactly the

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.060
same as HTML5 sandbox filesystem
API, but basically

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.765
have better access
to Google Drive.

00:30:42.765 --> 00:30:44.975
I think ultimately we don't want
to necessarily, like if

00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:47.310
it's standardized, have it just
on Google Drive only.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.760
But right now, it's integrated
the experience of Chrome

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.450
applications.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:54.390
You'll basically save the file
to the HTML5 filesystem and

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.830
via the Google Drive--

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:56.950
and still sandboxed, right?

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:59.570
It's still sandboxed inside your
applications area, not

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.910
completely available
to everyone.

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.316
Have that file and replicate it
out to all your other that

00:31:04.316 --> 00:31:06.950
kind of instances of your
application for that user.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.670
So if they're on their MacBook
Pro and they save a file in to

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.215
their local sandboxed
filesystem, and then they go

00:31:13.215 --> 00:31:15.035
in their Chromebook, well, it
will start to appear there.

00:31:15.035 --> 00:31:17.720
And it will just be available
and synchronized.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.840
So that facet, it's very
early on at the moment.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.920
It's still experimental.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.610
And there's a lot of things that
we're trying to work out

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.590
how we think developers
want to use it.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:31.660
Right now, there's a collision
between the same file and two

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.340
different updates
on two machines.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.630
The developer has to delete one
of those files, basically.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:38.880
And we want to get a little bit
smarter about what to do

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.610
and how to kind of help the
developer resolve the conflict

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.425
and the collisions
inside files.

00:31:44.425 --> 00:31:47.820
But that's one API to check out,
test, and obviously watch

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.640
in a couple of weeks when we're
going to show it off.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.430
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:55.070
And then the following week
we've got alarms, the

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.030
week of March 11.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.730
So we've got plenty of cool
stuff coming out for you.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:01.540
So stay tuned, and we'll
see you next

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.700
week at the same time.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.630
Paul, thanks for joining,
and thanks

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.910
for watching, everybody.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.160
PAUL KINLAN: Bye.
