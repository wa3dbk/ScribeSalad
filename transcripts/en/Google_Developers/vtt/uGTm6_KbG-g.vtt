Hi, my name is Carl and I am a Software Engineer
on the Google Chrome team. In this video,

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.139
I will describe how to integrate with the
Chrome Web Store Licensing API.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.930
Suppose you are creating a web app. The Chrome
Web Store makes it easy to charge people to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.920
use that app wherever it is running. Users
will purchase access to your app right from

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.010
the Chrome Web Store. To check whether a user
has paid for your app, use the Chrome Web

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.260
Store’s licensing API.
The licensing API takes two inputs: the app

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.090
ID and the user ID.
The app ID is the id the Chrome Web Store

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.370
assigns to your app when you first create
it in the store.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.210
The user ID is the Google-provided OpenID
URL. Typically, with OpenID the user ID is

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.470
not shared unless the user explicitly grants
permission to the application; however, Google

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.869
Chrome grants this permission automatically
when the user installs the application. Users

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.790
in other browsers will still see an approval
step.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.619
A number of OpenID libraries may be used to
determine the OpenID URL.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.970
To see a comprehensive list of libraries just
visit http://wiki.openid.net/Libraries.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.740
Some specific OpenID libraries you can explore
are the following:

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.150
For Java you can try OpenID4Java.
For Python try using Google App Engine’s

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.400
Django OpenID.
You can find more information on how to use

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.080
OpenID in our documentation.
The Chrome Web Store doesn’t allow just

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.990
anyone to call the licensing API. The store
will check that the caller is authorized to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.720
make a licensing API check for a given app.
In this way we provide separation among the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.250
licensing data for various apps.
The developer that creates a web app in the

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.020
Chrome Web Store is the only user with permission
to call the licencing API for that app.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.130
In order to securely authenticate the owner
of an application, we use OAuth access tokens.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.549
These tokens prove that you have the right
to call the API.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.080
We automatically provide you with an OAuth
access token in the developer dashboard for

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.750
each app you own. An OAuth access token is
really a token and a token secret, but I just

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.040
refer to them as an access token.
To create a token, go to the developer dashboard

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.450
and follow the link labeled “AuthToken”.
The next page explains what you need the token

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.380
for and at the bottom of the page, you will
see a button to generate the OAuth access

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.560
token.
When you click that button you will see the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.690
values for oauth_token and oauth_token_secret
fill in.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.091
Those tokens are scoped so they will only
work to access the Chrome Web Store licensing

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:46.830
API and cannot be used to access other information
from Google.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.730
Please note that the Chrome Web Store will
not display these values more than one time

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.980
for security reasons, so, don’t forget to
copy them to a secure location before you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.800
leave the page. If necessary, you can return
later to generate a new access token.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.190
Now you should have all the data you need
to call the licensing API:

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.450
An OAuth access token
A User ID

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.740
and an App ID.
Let’s look at the details of calling the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.069
API using HTTP.
The licensing API endpoint is simply a URL

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.180
containing the app ID and the user ID. The
app and user IDs must be URL-encoded.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.530
To call the licensing API, you need to add
OAuth signature parameters. You can use an

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:43.690
OAuth library to sign the HTTP requests.
Visit http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/docs/client-libraries.html

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.670
for a list of libraries that may be used to
perform these API calls in various web development

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.849
languages.
The signing step needs the following pieces

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.840
of data:
The consumer key: This is always “anonymous”.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.500
The consumer secret: This is also always “anonymous”.
The token and the token secret.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.629
The consumer key and consumer secret are anonymous
because you, the developer, are granting access

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.580
to the application you own.
JSON is the default response format for API

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.000
requests. This response will indicate whether
the user should be granted permission to use

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.970
your app.
If you prefer the ATOM format, you can specify

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.949
alt=atom in the URL.
