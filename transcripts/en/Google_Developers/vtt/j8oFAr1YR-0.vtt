&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Hi, everyone. Welcome. I think
we will have a few more people sprinkling

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.810
in here, but my name is Erik Kay.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: And hi, I'm Mihai Parparita,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.810
and together we work on the Chrome apps team.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So just a quick show of hands

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.690
so I can get a feel for what the audience
is here, how many people are as familiar with

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.619
Chrome apps as they are today?
All right, great. That makes things easier.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.930
So why don't we dive in a little bit and just
sort of do a little recap about how we got

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.820
to where we're at today?
So I/O last year we talked about a few things.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.460
First off, as you know, we talked about Chrome
getting to, you know, 160 million active users.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.420
We also launched for Chrome apps in-app payments
through Google Wallet.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.280
We announced that the Web store was now localized
in 42 languages.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.280
And we had the Angry Birds exclusive promotion
that really showed how that it was really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.360
possible to make great quality apps just using
HTML5.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.520
And we've kept busy over the last year since
then.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.930
The first thing, you know, to highlight, is
Native Client. We launched that this fall.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.520
And Native Client really brought to the table
a great set of games. You know, some showed

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.340
that you could do high performance computing,
that you could leverage native code in your

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.630
browser. Things like Bastion, Mini-Ninjas,
From Dust, great titles that show off the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.020
capabilities of the platform.
You saw Gaikai in the keynote today that really

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.409
was another great example.
We redesigned the Web store. We have a completely

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.409
new look and feel, and that really expanded
the usage that we saw out from our users.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.509
Users were much more engaged. They come back
more frequently. They install more applications.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.439
We've announced today that we're up to 750
million app installs. Overall things are going

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.950
great for the Web store.
And of course, you know that Chrome is now

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.079
at 310 million active users, almost doubling
last year's number. So the reach potential

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:26.079
for apps has been going through the roof.
However, you know, that's never enough. And

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.049
we want -- we've been worrying about the platform
itself and how to keep pushing that forward.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.230
And so we've been thinking about, well, what
do Web developers need? What are the capabilities

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.029
that are missing from the platform and what
can we do to move things forward?

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.189
So we've been listening to your feedback and
we've actually been bringing people on the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.709
team who have come from Web development backgrounds.
People who have experience building some these

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.709
Web apps, like Mihai, who is our tech lead
for Google Reader, which many of you may know.

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:03.199
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Yeah. So I was on Google
Reader for quite a few years. As you may know,

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.389
Google Reader is an advanced HDIC application
that has pushed the edge of what browsers

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.400
can do.
On the other hand, we feel like the platform

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.069
could do more, could provide more flexibility,
more power for Reader and similar apps.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.120
Just to give you a few examples, Reader is
one of the first apps to be offline enabled,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.449
and that was a technical challenge and we
fought with manifests and caches like everyone

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:32.430
else, but even with that it wasn't the best
user experience. Users had to enable offline

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.999
mode. Users had to launch a browser to use
the app which sort of feels like a tautology.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.139
Why would I use a browser when I'm offline?
Another issue that we faced in Reader was

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.299
dealing with third-party content where feeds
can have Flash, they can have iFrames, they

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.329
can have arbitrary JavaScript, and we want
to have the experience to be as rich as possible,

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.689
but we don't want a random feed to be able
to steal your Google cookies or otherwise

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.439
take advantage of the fact that it's being
displayed in a privileged environment. We

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.949
have to jump through a lot of hoops to sanitize
the content, have whitelists, blacklists,

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:08.739
and we always lived in fear of well, what
if we missed something? What if tomorrow anyone

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.119
can access your Reader account and your account
and all that?

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.759
And finally, users wanted a lot more flexibility
about how they consume feeds. Do they want

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.400
to open up the item in a new tab, in a new
window, in a pop-up, they want a mini browser

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.840
inside of Reader? We couldn't provide any
of that. We could provide a usewindow.open

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.300
or target equals blank, and sort of hope for
the best, hope that the pop-up blocker didn't

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.080
get us, but that was about it.
So Reader, you know, is in some ways a well-suited

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.460
app for the Web environment and I'm sure others
of you have run into even more issues.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.060
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. So we took feedback like
that and we really started to push forward

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.780
in terms of what we wanted to do.
We're evolving in four main areas. The main

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.550
one that we'll start with is we're pulling
apps outside of the browser. We'll dive into

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.060
each of these in more detail, but just the
quick overview is pulling them out of the

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.409
browser. We're enhancing the user interface,
giving you more control over the windows and

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:10.960
we're making apps be offline by default, making
it so it's easy to build them in a way that

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.259
they behave reasonably with poor network connectivity.
And finally, we're adding a wealth of new

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.919
APIs to give you access to powerful system
and device capabilities.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.650
So let's dive in a little more deeply.
So what do we mean by breaking out of the

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.930
browser? Well, the first thing we mean is
that you launch apps from outside the browser.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.930
So you'll see in a minute here that basically
you'll no longer need to launch the browser,

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.710
go into Chrome, go to the new tab page to
find your apps. The apps will instead come

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.819
from the operating system, the traditional
place that you're used to finding them and

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.099
launching them.
Second, the apps will act as peers to their

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:56.800
other native applications, top level windows.
They interact alt tab to switch between applications.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.189
Everything you would expect a native app to
behave like in a user interface perspective,

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.050
OS integration perspective. It will no longer
be a tab in a browser.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.780
So let's give them a demo and show them what
this looks like, Mihai.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.580
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Sure. So this presentation
is actually in itself an app. The demo just

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.319
breaks out of the app. And if I move the window
out of the way you can see that I have my

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:30.180
top level window. It has, you know, minimal
-- no tab strip, no Omnibox, and there's a

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.270
Chrome icon at the bottom that seems to be
getting clipped. And where I can make tabs

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.469
and the application itself has its own icon
in the launcher.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.749
This is the experience on Chrome OS where
it is a full application launcher. On Windows

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:49.939
there will be shortcuts on a desktop and the
appropriate behavior on other platforms.

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.520
So let's switch back to the app and let's
talk about UI.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:07:00.520
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. So enhanced user interface.
So you already saw that it has a native level

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.330
-- top level window frame. There's no browser
Chrome, there's no tabs, no address bar, no

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:15.330
back button. And further, you have full control
over the look and feel of that frame.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.849
Next you have -- you can actually manage multi-window
applications.

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.699
Actually, I did this the wrong order. But
multi-window applications. So that means you

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.249
really will be able to cooperate between multiple
windows and have them interoperate. Today

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:35.080
in tabs it's very hard to sort of have multiple
tabs that are not cooperating with each other

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.960
and interacting with each other and it's hard
to do things like tool bars and, you know,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.279
panels that cooperate and interact with your
host window.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:51.729
And you know, one of the things by not having
browser Chrome is, well, what do links do?

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:55.789
Well, links behave just like they would in
a normal native app. When you click on the

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:00.409
link it opens the browser window. Let's show
them. There's a link to Google.com.

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:04.879
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: I'll tab back to the application.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. So now you're back inside

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:09.889
the application. So we've got another demo
here that shows a little bit more about what

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:13.110
windowing control can do.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: This is a little toy demo

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:17.580
showing that we have an app window. You can
see the minimal Chrome. Bizarro World one

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.139
is actually a full custom window where the
app controls every single on it. In this case

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:29.139
I just made it all black. We have full control
over behavior so I know I can have it resize

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:35.599
itself and certainly drag around and follows.
You imagine this could be a little dog toolbar

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:39.169
and I can control it or have the window in
a minimized state.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:46.169
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. So offline by default.
Before we dive into the specifics of this,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.160
it's probably worth explaining what do we
mean by offline.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.380
So A lot of people think offline and they
think, okay, I'm on an airplane, I have no

00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:00.610
connectivity whatsoever. That's not the only
time that offline matters for applications.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:06.910
Offline can mean I have got slow connectivity.
I've got spotty connectivity. For anyone who

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.620
uses a cellular network, maybe in this building,
the Wi-Fi, you know, you're used to not have

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.130
reliable connectivity.
The speed might change as you go. Maybe you're

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:21.420
in a hotel with a captive proxy. If your application
is trying to talk over the network, it needs

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.350
to be able to be robust in the face of these
different network connections.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:31.839
So how do we do this? Well, we're starting
from a base of Chrome packaged apps. Basically

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:36.529
for those of you who aren't familiar with
Chrome apps in general, packaged apps are

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:43.529
a zip file, a collection of HTML, JavaScript
and other resources for your Web application

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:48.380
that are downloaded, installed on the user's
computer. So all the code and logic is always

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.050
there ready to go.
We take some extra steps and -- to make sure

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.839
that we're enforcing a strict separation between
data and user interface.

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:05.180
By being packaged, by making sure that all
the code and logic are always being -- are

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:09.579
always running from client side and not being
generated server side, we mean that the app

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:15.199
doesn't get into a broken state and it's up
to you to download your data, store it locally,

00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:21.779
render your UI appropriately.
We further enforce this with -- support this

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:28.779
with building APIs that are themselves resilient
to being in these poor network connectivity

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.310
conditions.
And finally, this may seem like a small thing,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.730
but the fact that we've moved apps from launching
outside the browser actually addresses one

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.420
of the key usability issues with offline.
Today some of you may have actually gone through

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.120
the effort to make your hosted Web app work
offline and found that even after you went

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.709
through all the effort to work with AppCache
and make that do what you want it had to do

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:59.550
that users are still not finding that functionality
and they are still frustrated with using it.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:05.399
For the reasons that Mihai was pointing out
before, they had to know first to launch the

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:11.180
browser, then they had to somehow navigate
to your app. Well, if they know how to bookmark

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.769
it, that's about 10% of users, then they can
get back to it. What about for the rest of

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:21.040
the users?
Well, for them they have to either know what

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.759
the URL is ahead of time or for many of them
actually what they do is they go to their

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:28.740
favorite search engine and they try to navigate
to it. And guess what? When you're offline

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:35.639
search engines don't really work.
So people in a poor connected world are continuously

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:41.290
reinforced that the browser doesn't work because
all their tabs are broken. Even when they

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.899
have an app that they know works, they don't
know how to get to it. So pulling app outside

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:50.320
the browser and making it a first class peer
to their other native applications gets past

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.970
all that anxiety and all the logistics of
getting there.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:12:00.480
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: So we're gonna demo this
very quickly and we'll get the presentation

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.579
out of the way. I'm going to yank the ethernet
cable out of my Chromebook.

00:12:05.579 --> 00:12:09.940
As you can see there's a little icon in the
corner that says I'm offline. I can refresh

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.459
Google and show that it doesn't seem to work.
And we're going to install an app.

00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:18.779
In this case we're going to sort of do a kind
of stress test where we are offline. We're

00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:23.550
going to install the app right now in developer
mode, but it should process the same. And

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.029
this app has never had a chance to run before.
It's never had a chance to talk to its server,

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:32.220
download data, but the experience should still
be acceptable.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.389
The specific app we're doing is a diff tool
that lets you compare files. So when it launched

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:42.720
it has an offline indicator that says you're
currently offline, so all it can do is it

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.720
can diff local files, but dash will keep working.
So let me pick a couple of files. And as you

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.190
can see -- I lost focus.
As you can see, the application still works.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.959
If I manage to find the ethernet cable and
plug it back in --

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:10.959
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: While Mihai is doing that, I'll
point out that we're doing this demo on Chromebook

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:19.389
and we're doing it with the latest Canary
build of Chrome OS. So we're taunting the

00:13:21.699 --> 00:13:24.959
demo gods --
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Fine in this case. We are

00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:30.970
back on line. The app has noticed that we
are online. The choose URL feature has appeared,

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:37.970
so now we can diff not just local files, but
ones that live on a server. So I think I have

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:48.250
some cuts. And as you can see --
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: This is really a tortured case

00:13:52.319 --> 00:13:58.300
for an application. It launched for the first
time never having seen the network. So it

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:04.199
was able to run robustly. Without quitting
and relaunching it, it recovered. So it was

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:09.230
able to see, you know, the fact that the network
was back. You didn't have to do anything,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.180
you didn't have to refresh the page, you didn't
have to take that extra step. The app was

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.199
just able to proceed.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Now that the projector

00:14:15.199 --> 00:14:19.899
has been fixed you guys can see that the app
launcher at the bottom is what I was referring

00:14:19.899 --> 00:14:26.899
where all these apps can be launched offline.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. All right. So new APIs.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:34.490
Now, this is one of the more -- the area that
I think most of you are going to dive into

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:40.360
first when you start playing with Chrome packaged
apps. And it's all the new APIs. We think

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:46.440
of them in three groups. The first area are
what we call system APIs. The system APIs

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.139
interact with the operating system at a low
level or with hardware on your device, so

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:54.839
maybe USB or bluetooth, or as you saw in this
morning's keynote, raw UDP or TCP.

00:14:54.839 --> 00:15:01.839
These will enable a wide variety of apps that
you've never been able to build with Web technology

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.500
before.
Next we've got shared data APIs, and shared

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.250
data APIs are -- provide ways of interoperating
with other applications on your system. Things

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:17.180
like photos or contacts, calendar entries,
things that you want to be able to access

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.579
safely from multiple applications.
And finally then a group of service APIs.

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:29.189
The service APIs are your -- the Web services
that you all know and love, but built into

00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:34.290
Chrome, into the Chrome runtime in such a
way that it's going to be resilient to poor

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:41.290
network conditions. So things like analytics,
in-app payments, things like that, will be

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.620
coming to the APIs.
Why don't we give a demo of one of these APIs

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.759
in action?
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Sure. So this demo is going

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:55.759
to display me because I'm going to hold a
physical device here. This is a little science

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.990
fair kind of project that one of our engineers
Mike made. It has an arduino board on the

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.350
back. It has -- it talks to the Chromebook
via a serial port, a serial-over-bluetooth

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:12.060
a serial-over-USB in this case, and it has
a little stepper motor here that is controlled

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.800
by the arduino. And the slider at the bottom
of the screen controls the motor. It just

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.800
sends a one-byte command saying "please rotate
to my current position," and that goes over

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:30.879
the serial wire, the arduino interprets it.
The key thing here is that the Chromebook

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:35.790
knows nothing about this particular device
or about arduino in general, it just knows

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:39.329
that there's a serial port and that in turn
is exposed to the application. So all of the

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:44.050
logic about the specific device is in the
application that can be installed by any user.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.100
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: The other key bit is that all
this code is just JavaScript and HTML, right?

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:55.100
It is -- no special, no device drivers, no,
like, native code that needed to be there.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.730
That said, we are going to be providing bindings
in addition to JavaScript, also to Dart and

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.399
to Native Client, so you will be able to access
these APIs from whatever programming environment

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:07.770
that you'd like.
Speaking of the programming model, why don't

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:13.060
we dive in and take a look at some code.
Before we do that, though, just a refresher

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:20.060
of what is behind the core bit of the programming
model. So as I said, these are packaged apps,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.270
and that means they're a directory full of
resources.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:29.270
They have a background page that acts as a
hub, so what that means is this is what starts

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:39.660
up. When you launch the app, a background
page launches and it triggers an event, and

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.750
that's what -- then it's up to you to decide
what to do.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:48.230
In previous incarnations of Chrome apps we
had a launch URL, basically a page that would

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.600
open up in a tab. Now you've got full control
over how your app behaves, how many windows

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.730
it opens up, if it even opens up a window
at all, or does something in the background.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:04.760
And that last step is sort of an important
use case that we're really interested in is

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:10.130
being able to handle system level events and
have your app come and go based on signals

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.320
from the runtime.
So let's take a look at some of the code that

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.010
shows this in action.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Sure. So I'm going to call

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:24.590
up a Hello World demo. And incidentally, to
actually code the app I'm going to use an

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:30.460
app. This is a text editor that's been whipped
up by one of our other engineers.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.910
So like Erik said, first we start with the
manifest.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.840
So if you went to the extension talk yesterday,
you know there's a new manifest called Manifest

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.870
Version 2.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. And Manifest 2 basically

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:49.880
is the trigger that we use to enforce some
of the new policies with apps and extensions,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.110
and fork turns on CSP by default which we'll
talk about in a little bit, but it also is

00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:02.110
one of the keys for showing off the new app
behavior. It also has a -- the basics that

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:10.220
you're used to, a name, a version, and another
field that is -- you've seen before, the app

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.530
field, but rather than a launch URL like we
said before, instead it has a designation

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:23.150
of the background page, as I said, the main,
the hub of the application, it uses the same

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:29.000
event page technology that we've just announced
with Chrome extensions which means that it

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
basically can come and go on demand, as the
system needs it. So we specified the app.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.500
The other thing actually, Mihai, you might
want to add permissions to it. So permissions

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:47.900
are the way of specifying in the manifest
what capabilities your app needs up front.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:54.030
This allows us to, you know, control, you
know, it's a security feature that basically

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.860
allows us to limit the damage that an application
can do if it has a bug in it. So then next,

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.350
we're diving into the actual background page
itself. This is main. As I mentioned before,

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:11.590
what it does is it loads, and then it fires
off a launch event. So the first thing Mihai

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:17.140
does in his background page is set up an event
listener in the background page, and in that,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:22.150
first thing he does is to create a window,
using our new window app API. And basically

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:29.150
this is the Hello World, launch the app, get
a launch event, create a window, show just

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:36.550
an obvious snippet of HTML, so here is our
Hello World. The next step is to load into

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:43.580
Chrome, now again, since this is just a packaged
app directory, it's built in the same technology

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.190
as Chrome extensions and other Chrome Apps
have been built in the past, so just going

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:53.880
to developer mode, load and unpack extension,
and then we can just launch the app from the

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.960
app launcher directly, there you go, and we
have our Hello World, so really trivial bit

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.960
of code, as you can imagine you can do whatever
you want from that launch event and do more

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.830
advanced things, so before we do the more
advanced things, let's talk a little bit more

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:14.930
about some of the other features of the programming
model. So one of the things that's interesting

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:21.310
is that all of the windows are what we call
single page applications. There's no navigation.

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:26.340
So we think this leads to an overall better
experience and simplifies a few things, again,

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:30.160
the fact that we don't have a back button,
that we don't have an address bar, we don't

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.000
want to have people building apps that wind
up getting users trapped and stuck, we don't

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000
-- we want to get rid of that flash of white
repaint. And we've also actually removed a

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:46.600
few Web features, things that are -- that
we think lead overall to bad Web performance

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.190
or have security problems with them. It turns
out that on the Web at large, it's very hard

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:56.290
to deprecate features. Very hard to (inaudible)
We have strict compatibility needs. As people

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.510
who are going to be building these Chrome
Apps are going to be starting from scratch,

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.890
we have the opportunity to take a few and
just eliminate them from the beginning, and

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.540
they will be things like synchronous requests
that will block the UI thread or again things

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.910
that might call security problems. Speaking
of security, let's talk a little bit about

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.600
the security model. So to start with, you
get all the things that you're used to with

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.990
Chrome, you get process isolation, Chrome
is famous for being a multi-process browser,

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:31.990
and apps are no different. Each app runs in
its own process, completely separate from

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:39.270
each other. We also Sandbox each app, so each
app has its own storage area, its own Sandbox

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.040
execution runtime Sandbox which makes it so
that even if it had a bug, the limit, the

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:56.040
damage to what it could do is tightly controlled
by the runtime. And part of that is the permissions

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:01.440
model I was talking about before. The app
has to declare up front what capabilities

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.650
it wants to use, so in this case we have our
little app that used the serial port API and

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:11.440
the Web cam, so if that happened to have a
bug in it, that could be exploited by an attacker

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.270
somehow, the worst that could happen is it
could do exactly what that app could do and

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.390
talk to the serial part, the Web cam. This
is very different from what you're used to

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.720
with native executables, where once you have
a security bug in the native executable, you

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:31.720
have access to the whole machine, everything
the user could do, attacker could do. So I

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:38.030
mentioned content security policy. Now, what
content security policy is is a way to protect

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:42.100
your app against cross-side scripting bugs.
For those of you who aren't familiar with

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.340
cross-side scripting, it's basically a way
that an attacker can somehow get code injected

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:53.040
into your page and run in the context of your
page. Now, in a Web page, this is bad enough,

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.540
because it means like -- in something like
Gmail, it could -- you know, an attacker could

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.740
maybe read all of your e-mail and post it
to another site. In the context of an app

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.780
it could do even more potentially with the
new more powerful APIs we're adding, like,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.340
you know, I don't know access your Web cam,
leave persistent files somewhere on your hard

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.370
drive, talk to some hardware you didn't want
them to talk to. So we really try to lock

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:22.780
this down content security policy makes it
so your apps will be resistant to these sorts

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.020
of attacks. So let's show that in action.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Sure, so I'm going to take

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.450
my Hello World demo from earlier and make
it actually do something besides play Hello

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:38.450
World. I'm going to have it -- have a little
form that asks users for their name and then

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:46.250
displays it in the output, so that is the
markup side, and then on the scripting side,

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:54.080
I have sort of the obvious implementation
I just described where I -- where I get the

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.050
submit event and display the name and the
output.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.930
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: For those of you who are, you
know, the more observant in the crowd, you'll

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:12.230
know that inner HTML is a pretty dangerous
feature of the web to use. Basically is taking

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:17.760
-- he's taking unescaped content and just
injecting it as code straight into his page.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.700
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Let's load that same page
because it doesn't use any app APIs just in

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:29.700
a regular Chrome tab the way a Web app would
run in. So, sure, I can type in my name, but

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:37.610
because of inner HTML, as Erik mentioned,
markup gets interpreted, H1s aren't so bad,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:43.380
well, what if I had an unclick handler here
that --

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.120
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So you can see that this is script.
He's actually typing in JavaScript, now it's

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.470
going to get injected into his page. Now,
obviously this is a very simplified form of

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.530
an access because there's a form field, user
had to type it in. Usually they might come

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:03.530
in as a parameter in URL somehow got data
stored into your system, but you can see that

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.330
if they could run code in the context of your
app, they would be able to do the dangerous

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:11.220
things your app could do. Let's try that same
code in an app.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:17.410
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: So app still works. HTML
still gets interpreted because, you know,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:24.410
Chrome does what it's asked and gives us inner
HTML, but if I type in that same script snippet,

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:33.100
right, and try to run it, nothing happens.
If I pull up the developer tools, these are

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:44.140
the same developer tools that you're used
to, you can see a content script clause here

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.250
that appears.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. This is basically showing

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:52.330
you that we are locking down the app, so if
you have a bug that might enable somebody

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:57.480
to inject inline script into your page, it
can't -- it can't exploit anything in your

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.240
app, it's just stopped right up front. As
Mihai pointed out, this is all tightly integrated

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.540
again with all the developer tools that you're
used to, you know, so you can leverage all

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.960
the power that's there. They've been evolving
really rapidly, and so there's a lot of great

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.070
features if you haven't been checking them
out.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:25.070
So let's talk about a few other bits of a
security model. We take a further step and

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:32.050
isolate storage from one app to the other.
So what this means is that what gets written

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:36.830
in one app, what happens in one app, stays
in that app, it can't affect what happens

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:43.020
in the other. Cookies in your browser don't
affect cookies in your app and vice versa.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.690
And this is true not only for the origin,
but if your app is doing -- interacting with

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:53.490
Web content from other origins, that too is
isolated, so if you're logged in to Twitter,

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.510
you know, in your browser with one account,
and your app interacts with Twitter, it isn't

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:03.220
affected by that. It would have to log in
separately.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.820
And I mentioned explicit shared data APIs
before when I was talking about new APIs.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:12.410
This is also a security feature, because it
means that we can give apps access to more

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:17.320
powerful functionality without exposing your
whole hard drive to them, and without giving

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.220
them the ability to write arbitrary files
into arbitrary locations, so they can't leave

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.540
an executable on your hard drive and they
can't, you know -- they can't just read your

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.430
Quicken file, for example, but they can read
your photos perhaps, if they've got the photos

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:39.430
permission. And one further distinction that
we've made for apps is that we no longer have

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:49.740
access to extension APIs within packaged apps.
So we made an explicit split to say that an

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.950
app is outside the browser, and that means
that interacting with the browser through

00:28:53.950 --> 00:29:00.090
these extension APIs no longer makes sense.
It's also true vice versa, extension APIs

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:07.090
can't affect apps. These apps are truly isolated
from the browser and operate on their own.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.900
There's one last security feature that we
added here, which actually has some very useful

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.760
functionality as well, so you've heard us
just talk about how we lock down this, lock

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.280
down that, you can't get this web content
or that content. Well, sometimes it's actually

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:25.190
useful to get a host of Web content in your
app. Well, in a similar way that you're used

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:32.190
to with native desktop and mobile applications,
you can embed essentially a view, a full browser

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:37.570
inside of your app using something we call
the browser tag, so this is different from

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:44.570
an iFrame in a couple of different ways. The
first is that it's a top level frame. It doesn't

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.880
think of itself as an iFrame, it thinks of
itself as if it were in a tab or in a window

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.810
by itself. Second is that it runs out of process.
So if there's a bug, if there's some issue

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:02.720
where by going to remote website, somebody
found a security hole in Chrome, it would

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:09.120
only affect the browser tag instance. It wouldn't
be able to affect your app. And finally, once

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.000
again storage is isolated, so again, what
happens in this browser tag doesn't affect

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
what's in your app and vice versa. So we've
got a little more time, so why don't we dive

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.550
back into the -- that serial port demo and
show what it's like to actually use some of

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.550
the more powerful APIs and do a little bit
more stuff with it.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:35.720
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Okay. So I'm going to close
some more windows and load up a standalone

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:42.720
version of that serial port demo that we had
earlier, and let's launch it. So same sort

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:52.350
of setup. Camera using the Web RTC API to
show me, the same slider. This one is a bit

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:57.660
fancier. It has a serial port ticker listing
all serial ports that are local. So the goal

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.910
is we have a Chrome logo, physical Chrome
logo here, and we have the on-screen logo

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:08.610
here, this board actually also has a potentiometer,
this little knob I want to turn, and I want

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:13.990
to make it so that turning this knob turns
the logo on the screen, so let's pull up the

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:20.990
code for this. So it's in --
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right, so the existing code was

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.950
basically writing to the board, sending it
data. Now this one, we're going to change

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.140
it to add read function, read back.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: So walking through the

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:38.100
existing code briefly, we have the Web RTC
side of things where we get access to the

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:44.120
user's camera, and display the result. Since
the app has the video permission, this did

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:51.090
not trigger info bar, the access happened
immediately. We have the slider, the HTML5

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:56.770
range element here, we set up an on-change
listener for it to set the position, and we

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:01.900
built a serial port picker by listing all
of the ports that are available. Once we pick

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:08.900
a port, we have the open API call to actually
start opening up a connection to it. And once

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.790
we open, we can start setting the position.
We have the connection ID that we get from

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:21.500
the API callback. This is -- all these functions
are async and we can start setting the position.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.670
To actually set the position, we just send
a single byte as -- actually as an ASCII character

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:32.130
from 0 to 9. We're using the buffers so that
the serial port API can work with any kind

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:37.640
of binary data, too. We're using ASCII here
for convenience. So as Erik mentioned, the

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:43.570
next up is to actually start reading back
from the board. So given that there's a write

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:49.040
API call here, because you can imagine there's
also a read API call we can use --

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:54.690
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. As Mihai mentioned all
of the Chrome App APIs are asynchronous, so

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:01.290
you'll notice they all take a callback, and
so he has in his function there, and on read

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.410
function for the callback which he's pasted
in to save some typing time.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:10.270
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Yep. So using array buffers
we read back the data from the serial port,

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:17.060
we do the opposite conversion from ASCII to
a degree value, and then we use CSS 3 transforms

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.250
to set the position of the logo and finally
we want to read the next byte, so this isn't

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:26.820
a blocking call, it's just whenever the next
byte happens to appear, the call back will

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.790
be invoked again. Let's save this. We're actually
going to save it in the same place.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:36.890
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: And that -- by the way, that programming
model did show some of the flexibility and

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.910
power of having an asynchronous API, but we're
able to sort of cue these things up and have

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:48.910
multiple async things going on at once, and
the callbacks happen, you know, when they

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:51.620
happen. We don't have to worry about inner
leaving them.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.020
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: The App, it's the same
sort of edit reload cycle that you might be

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.720
used to from web development, and so let's
make sure it still works, that we can still

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:05.670
control it, so that part still works, and
now if we have the knob up here, and we turn

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:12.670
it, the Chrome logo appears to spin, so we're
reading data.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:18.819
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Obviously, this is a really simple

00:34:18.819 --> 00:34:23.589
demo and not all of you are going to be sitting
in your garage hacking on arduino boards,

00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:29.919
but we're hoping that this sort of conveys
the kind of thing you can do. Web technology,

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:32.859
and interact with hardware and system level
data.

00:34:32.859 --> 00:34:36.289
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: For example, people on
our team have built our C clients, you know,

00:34:36.289 --> 00:34:41.289
telling their clients to use the raw socket
API, someone else built an interface to a

00:34:41.289 --> 00:34:45.289
heart rate monitor that uses Bluetooth, and
all of this networks on a Chrome build, for

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:47.879
example, that couldn't talk to these devices
before.

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:54.879
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So let's sort of wrap up about
and recap a little bit of what we've gone

00:34:55.259 --> 00:35:02.259
over. So we're evolving apps to break out
of the browser, to have enhanced user interface,

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:09.329
more control over the windowing. To be offline
by default, to have access to new, more powerful

00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:16.329
APIs, now, we're also -- this is also available
for you to play with right now, basically

00:35:17.319 --> 00:35:21.410
as we said, this is canary build of Chrome.
For those of you who don't know, the Canary

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:28.029
is our nightly update schedule. It's available
for windows and Mac. If you're a Linux or

00:35:28.029 --> 00:35:31.880
Chrome OS user, if you're brave enough, you
can do your own build, or you can wait for

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:38.880
your next dev channel to come out and you
can start playing with it then. We've also

00:35:39.759 --> 00:35:45.250
been asked in the past about why are these
apps, you know, specific to Chrome?

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:50.240
Why are they tied to Chrome?
And part of the reason is, because, well,

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:55.150
there hasn't been a lot of appetite in the
browser community for doing things, doing

00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:01.259
more dangerous capabilities, but in the last
six months or so, we've been, you know, talking

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:06.359
to more and more folks from the community
and discovered that momentum had been building,

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:11.230
that people were all starting to think along
these same lines; that building -- using Web

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:16.660
technologies to build more powerful applications,
its time has come, and so we're working with

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:23.660
the W3C and with other browser vendors including
Mozilla, and Adobe, and Intel and Samsung,

00:36:24.039 --> 00:36:28.859
people in the Web community to form the new
working group to help standardize this going

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:33.809
forward, so we're excited to help take the
technology that we've been building for Chrome

00:36:33.809 --> 00:36:40.589
and try to contribute it and make it a standard
across multiple operating systems and platforms.

00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:46.640
And finally you heard Sundar mention this
in the keynote, but our intent is to make

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.619
these apps work on mobile as well. Everywhere
the Chrome runtime exists, we think that we

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:58.619
can build -- bring apps -- bring this technology
along with it. Now, we only showed you this

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:04.660
very simple serial demo, and -- but there's
a lot more that you can check out. Some of

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:10.880
it right here at I/O. If you go over to the
Chrome Sandbox area for example, you can see

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:16.740
Sencha has a neat media player demo that actually
is implementing UP&amp;P to stream from a local

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:23.740
media server, which is kind of cool. Kendo
has a photo booth app that uses a lot of the

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:30.750
Web RTC stuff. There's a text editor that
was done by the annular JST at Google, and

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.039
there's a demo that we'll call "Johnny" that
is a --

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:41.140
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Johnny HTML5.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Oh, Johnny HTML5. Sorry. Johnny

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:48.140
HTML5 which is a Lego mindstorms robot which
is being controlled over Bluetooth from your

00:37:48.519 --> 00:37:53.589
desktop computer. Now, you can find all of
these samples and a bunch more, actually,

00:37:53.589 --> 00:38:00.589
in our new GitHub repo at GitHub.com, Google
Chrome, there's an apps demo section there,

00:38:01.259 --> 00:38:08.259
so I encourage you to go fork and play and
contribute.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:16.460
And -- and finally, the way to learn more,
you can read our docs up at developer.chrome.com/apps.

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:22.569
Now just a quick warning. Since all of this
new on the Canary channel by default, our

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:26.869
apps documentation points you at our current
stable channel stuff. But there will be a

00:38:26.869 --> 00:38:33.019
helpful link there that shows you how to get
to the latest stuff. You can also join our

00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:38.299
mailing list, chromium-apps@chromium.org,
and if you want to talk to people in person,

00:38:38.299 --> 00:38:44.579
people on the engineering team, we also hang
out on RC at Chromium apps@freenotes. So feel

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:48.730
free to join in and ask away, we are looking
forward to hearing from you.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.970
We're really excited to see the kind of things
that you guys can build with what we're doing,

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:58.299
but it is early on. Expect some bugs. Expect
some growing pains. We would love feedback.

00:38:58.299 --> 00:39:05.299
So now we will take your questions.
[ Applause ]

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:11.500
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So if you have any questions,
please come to the mic. By the way, when if

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.980
-- if we end this and you still have questions
that you would rather not ask at the mic,

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.089
we will stick around afterwards for a few
minutes, but also you can find us over at

00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:24.349
the Chrome booth. We will be having office
hours, so feel free to, you know, not only

00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:31.349
check out the demos, but come by and ask us
questions.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.640
All right?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Can -- can an app launch another app?

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:43.160
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Not right now. That's a good question.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Can you describe more specifically

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.930
what you would like to do here? Is it a matter
of like I would like to send an email so I

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:53.930
could launch the Gmail app sort of thing?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, sort of like the launcher, but without

00:39:56.069 --> 00:40:01.099
having to bother the user with them going
to find the app, saying this is the app that

00:40:01.099 --> 00:40:05.349
you are looking for to complete this request.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So you can do some of it with

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:10.119
Web intense but not exactly the way that you're
talking about for making a full launch replacement.

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:14.859
But that's the kind of thing actually we would
probably more likely expose through extensions

00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:19.369
in some way, but remember that each operating
system is going to have it's own sort of natural

00:40:19.369 --> 00:40:25.160
way of launching apps. So even if we did provide
it, that might be specific to Chrome OS or

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.150
something like that.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Go ahead.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:35.150
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah. You mentioned early on in the presentation
about offline usage and -- and the APIs into

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:40.220
the system that would degrade gracefully.
Offline. Can you give some examples of that?

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:45.059
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Sure. So take, for example, something
like that Google analytics right now. Everyone

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:50.470
is used to using Google analytics in their
app, they want to see how their app is being

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.589
used. The way to traditionally include it
would be to say script source equals whatever

00:40:55.589 --> 00:41:01.650
your path to your analytics JavaScript file.
But what if you are offline? So first off,

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:06.220
if you are offline when you launch the app,
it might just fail to load the analytics code

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:13.180
altogether or it might load part of it. Then
let's say that you load the code successfully

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:17.460
but then go offline. Well, the traditional
way that it does its thing is to ping a server

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:24.460
to send its data. So in that case, we're modifying
-- both the API to be loaded, you know, safely,

00:41:25.759 --> 00:41:31.799
always on the client side and to know when
it's offline and to store and cache some of

00:41:31.799 --> 00:41:38.799
its statistics locally so it that it can save
them up and report them up at a later time.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.130
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Okay.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:52.130
&gt;&gt;&gt; So you said there's going to be a split
between the app extensions -- I mean the app

00:41:52.519 --> 00:41:56.059
API and the extension API. Can you tell us
a bit about more about these, which go to

00:41:56.059 --> 00:42:01.069
which category?
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Sure. In general, extension APIs

00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:07.289
are going to be limited to the things that
affect the browser. That affect Web pages,

00:42:07.289 --> 00:42:13.529
tabs, that sort of thing. And apps is going
to be, you know, everything else. Now there's

00:42:13.529 --> 00:42:19.749
going to be a few that are going to exist
in both. In general, what we have done is

00:42:19.749 --> 00:42:24.049
for now limited the ones that are more dangerous
system-level things and those are not going

00:42:24.049 --> 00:42:28.049
to be available in extensions to begin with.
Something we're evaluating, we might change

00:42:28.049 --> 00:42:31.740
our minds on some of that over time. But to
start with, we're going to try to keep a clean

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.569
break between those sorts of things and apps
and the things for extensions, keep those

00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:38.980
tied to things that affect the browser.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Some APIs might behave

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:43.890
slightly differently, so the context of your
API, for example, can affect any Web page.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:48.740
But when used within your app it would affect
only your own apps pages.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:53.740
The docs I think should cover -- will start
covering this.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:59.079
&gt;&gt;&gt; You mentioned the -- the applicant launcher
can use a browser tag to launch another website.

00:42:59.079 --> 00:43:02.970
So can any JavaScript in that website interact
with the app?

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:09.480
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Sure. The way it will interact
-- you can interact with the browser tag,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:15.089
but it will be through a very specific post
message type of interface. So it will be possible

00:43:15.089 --> 00:43:21.690
to have some hosted Web content that you want
that can message out and for you as the better

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:26.339
of the browser tag to inject bindings into
the page as well. So you will have full control

00:43:26.339 --> 00:43:31.119
over that page. We actually expect eventually
the API to be rich enough that people will

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:35.940
be able to build a browser using a browser
tag. So maybe you don't like Chrome's UI and

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:42.410
you want to build a browser with tabs on the
side or something, I don't know, we think

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.720
that eventually you will be able to do that
with the browser tag.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.180
&gt;&gt;&gt; What is the level of integration with
the file system? So I saw in the text editor

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:53.980
you click, open a file, browser, you pick
a file. But say you wanted to build an editor

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.150
where you have, you know, a directory tree
on the side like a normal ID, click through

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.570
it.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Sure.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:03.200
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there some -- I guess what kind of
APIs are available for accessing the file

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.470
system generally?
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right. Actually, good point. We

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:10.450
didn't mention that. Probably most of you
noticed that the text editor that we were

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.769
using is itself an app and was interacting
with the file system and that text editor

00:44:14.769 --> 00:44:21.049
was using -- was, you know, all JavaScript
and HTML as well and it was using some of

00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:27.079
the file system APIs that we're working on.
In general, we're -- we're trying to limit

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:33.019
it, we can think of file system access in
kind of two ways. One way are ways where the

00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:37.549
user specifically indicates a specific file
that they want to give you as the app access

00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:42.799
to, through a standard open save dialogue
type of thing. For that, you can access files

00:44:42.799 --> 00:44:45.960
anywhere on the system, read, write access
to them with the right sort of permission

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.660
and that sort of a thing. But in terms of
arbitrary non-user initiated things, where

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:55.769
things you might say oh, because of file A
I want to access file B, C, and D, we don't

00:44:55.769 --> 00:45:02.769
allow you to do that. So in those type of
cases, take an IDE, as an example,we would

00:45:03.249 --> 00:45:09.079
say that you should bill something that interacts
with files in your own Sandbox in that world.

00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:13.920
So in that case maybe you might use native
client to build the git implementation that

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:19.670
actually, you know, can directly, you know,
pull down code from your repo right into your

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:23.720
Sandbox and edit things locally there. In
your Sandbox you have got full access to all

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.839
of the directories, all of the files, unrestricted.
It's the rest of the hard drive that's off

00:45:28.839 --> 00:45:31.749
limits, unless the user does a specific gesture
to give -- grant it --

00:45:31.749 --> 00:45:34.309
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: The third way for getting
access to other files on the hard drive is

00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:39.019
by the shared data API. So if your app is
interested in not any arbitrary file but photos,

00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:46.019
then it can, yes, ask for any photos without
a user gesture.

00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:50.019
&gt;&gt;&gt; So does that mean -- so on Windows or
Mac system, there's a system photo directories,

00:45:50.019 --> 00:45:54.460
where supposedly the user puts their photos,
you can ask for permission to access the files

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.150
in that directory; is that the idea?
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Yeah.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:02.059
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: It's not exactly that. It's a
little more. So we will actually try to discover

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:08.519
the types of places that you store your photos
and so a lot of people don't -- don't keep

00:46:08.519 --> 00:46:11.869
their photos leveraged to that one thing;
they have an extra hard drive, whatever. The

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:17.049
ability for users to configure what defines
their photos area. But even then it's not

00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:21.880
just directory access, limited to the types
of files that you can access to. There have

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.519
to be known types that we expect to be photos
in that case.

00:46:26.519 --> 00:46:30.460
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are there any particular patterns or practices

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.799
that we should employ when designing apps
in terms of UI state so when a user exits

00:46:35.799 --> 00:46:40.910
a UI, when we want that UI to come back exact
the same as when the user exited.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:46.190
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Yeah. That's a good point. So
there's a lot of things that we think are

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:51.539
going to change in terms of how you build
these apps that are different from what you

00:46:51.539 --> 00:46:55.759
might expect with the Web page. Because you
might be dealing with multiple Windows and

00:46:55.759 --> 00:47:01.249
because your app can get shut down and pulled
back at any time, we definitely want you to

00:47:01.249 --> 00:47:05.650
be resilient to that and to be able to restore
and pick up from exactly where you left off

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:10.779
in those cases.
You know, the example is remember -- think

00:47:10.779 --> 00:47:15.960
about this, these apps also need to be able
to run in mobile environments where mobile

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:20.359
apps don't have guarantees of a lifetime.
So that means that you have to write your

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:26.999
apps in a way where they might be shut down
due to system resource issues, right? But

00:47:26.999 --> 00:47:30.589
the user then switches back to them and it
should look like nothing happened and it should

00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:34.049
look like you never exited.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Sorry. The other part there

00:47:34.049 --> 00:47:38.950
is that we have storage API. So for storage
state, you can use the storage API which looks

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:43.109
like local storage but is asynchronous and
more importantly is synced so that can have

00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:47.349
the same state across all chrome devices that
the users assigned them to.

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:51.210
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Yeah, absolutely. So we actually
think it's a really interesting use case,

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:55.819
that you have your app in one state, you know,
on your machine at work, you go home and you

00:47:55.819 --> 00:48:00.299
launch it again from exactly where you left
off at work.

00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:04.519
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any ability for external devices to wake
up apps?

00:48:04.519 --> 00:48:10.809
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Well, basically the whole gist
of these -- of this notification based model

00:48:10.809 --> 00:48:15.099
that we've got for -- for the app, it should
enable that sort of a thing. We don't have

00:48:15.099 --> 00:48:19.940
any specific APIs to talk about on that front
yet. But -- but absolutely, things like -- you

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:24.799
can imagine things like server push, synchronization,
that sort of thing will all be --

00:48:24.799 --> 00:48:28.009
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: I think the one thing we
have is for the media gallery API, if the

00:48:28.009 --> 00:48:33.329
SD card is inserted, it will fire an event,
for example, so your app can decide to do

00:48:33.329 --> 00:48:40.329
something in response to photos that just
appeared even if it's not running.

00:48:41.319 --> 00:48:48.119
&gt;&gt;&gt; With the serial device that you were -- that
you were working there, can -- when can we

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:55.119
expect to -- like support for USB devices
in Chrome? And will it cover the whole range?

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:03.900
Can I like have a device that emulates an
RS 232 system, could I access these kind of

00:49:06.739 --> 00:49:08.489
things with Chrome, through Chrome?
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So this serial device here was

00:49:08.489 --> 00:49:15.180
actually a over USB, so it's serial over USB,
and actually we do have a USB API as well.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.910
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: Low level USB API.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Right, exactly. So basically if

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:23.789
you know everything about a device, one of
the demos that we have if you look in our

00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:26.980
repro --
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: It's a Griffin PowerMate.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:32.950
Sends its rotation position over the USB,
and we can read a byte off of it.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.640
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: So there's a little bit more work
we need to do with the USB to really flesh

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:40.720
it out. For example, we don't have support
for HID devices yet, you know, and I think

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.559
it would be nice for us to build in a little
more knowledge about some of the specific

00:49:42.559 --> 00:49:48.140
devices. Right now it's low level, you have
to know a bit more about the device that you

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:51.279
are talking to.
&gt;&gt;Mihai Parparita: For example, one of our

00:49:51.279 --> 00:49:56.069
developer relations people has got his connect
hooked up to an app, but that seems to work.

00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:58.640
&gt;&gt;&gt; Time schedule, approximately? Months,
years?

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.660
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: Well, as we said, you can play

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:08.160
with this today. And you know that in general
our approach is to take a very incremental

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:13.109
release early and often type approach. So
our intent is to get it out this year, you

00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:17.989
know, into the stable channel. But you should
be able to start playing with it now and building

00:50:17.989 --> 00:50:22.789
apps now. Just depends on your tolerance for
early code.

00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:28.509
&gt;&gt;&gt; Right, thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;Erik Kay: All right. Well, we might be out

00:50:28.509 --> 00:50:35.170
of questions. Any others? All right.
Well, I think that's about it then. If anybody

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:39.549
wants to find us afterwards, like I said,
we'll be over at the Chrome booth answering

00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:45.410
questions and come check out Johnny HTML and
the other fun demos over there and we hope

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.569
to hear more from you. Thanks.
