LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm Louis Gray from GDL, and I
have with me two distinguished

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.430
guests, Colt McAnlis
and Ilya Grigorik.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.160
Thank you for coming,
gentlemen.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.060
COLT MCANLIS: Thanks
for having us.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.860
ILYA GRIGORIK: Thanks.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.700
LOUIS GRAY: And we're
here to talk about

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.720
web performance today.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.180
And if you remember from the
keynote, it seems like so long

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.180
ago now, but it was only about
five to six hours, we were

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.440
talking about performance and
speed and simplicity and all

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.870
those things that really are
part of Chrome and really part

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.509
of everything that Google
is doing with our

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.790
approach to the web.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.270
And so I'm really happy to have
Colt and Ilya on here.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.960
Both of them have spoken a lot
about making the web faster

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.060
and Chrome tools that will
get the job done to make

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.740
everything go more quickly
for the web platform.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.320
So I want to just get
really started.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.530
Web performance is really all
of what we do at I/O and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.950
through the rest of the year.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.560
You guys even have
a booth upstairs.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.220
I just checked it out,
which is great.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.860
Why so much attention on
web performance, Colt?

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.280
COLT MCANLIS: Well, as every
app developer knows, as we

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.010
start to bridge into mobile,
it's not just about network

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.560
performance anymore, about
how fast your page loads.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.890
It's about how fast the page is
to respond to the user once

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.520
they're in it.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
So we have to feel like apps,
which means developers have to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.110
worry about the three pillars
of performance now--

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810
network, rendering,
and compute.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.410
And because of this, we've got
a lot of presence here, a lot

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.960
of great talks going on to try
to help developers start

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.580
talking about this, bring this
mental model to the table, and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.270
show them what tools they
need to get things done.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.850
LOUIS GRAY: It's interesting
you bring up networking,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.010
rendering, and computing.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.430
I came from a world where
computation was always the

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.300
bottleneck.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.050
And it was the server
that was slow.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.100
And I think what you've seen
with networking is networking

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.370
has grown exponentially,
10X each round.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.110
And it's really become something
where the data

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.000
center kind of becomes a cloud,
and you don't think

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.320
about the server anymore.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.810
And it's the network that's
the bottleneck.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.580
And that, as you mentioned,
can be really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.140
difficult and complex.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.380
So what are you guys doing up at
the booth to take all that

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.690
complexity and make it simple?

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.280
COLT MCANLIS: Well, we
absolutely are sure that it's

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.310
super-complex.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.840
I mean, we, as the Chrome
developers, spend a long time

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.420
architecting this stuff.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.400
What we've actually done is
we've assembled all of the

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.580
brains at Google who deal
with performance on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.265
a day-to-day basis.

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:07.270
And we basically have them
standing around for about

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.289
eight hours answering
questions.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.720
In addition to that, they're
going to be walking you

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.490
through the tools that we use
for internal analysis and all

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.630
of our profiling and showing
you how to use them.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.460
And at best, if you bring us
one of your sites, we'll

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.300
actually tell you what's
wrong and how to fix

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.390
it as soon as possible.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.680
LOUIS GRAY: And so that's the
performance Ilya shared.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.220
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.440
LOUIS GRAY: Now, I like the
idea of hearing a bunch of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.080
gurus standing around,
like, at my service.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.750
What exactly are they
going to be doing?

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960
Is it like I show up with my
laptop and they're going to

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.710
tweak my browser settings,
or what's the deal?

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.920
ILYA GRIGORIK: We won't tweak
your browser settings

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.190
necessarily, although maybe we
could, because as you saw in

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.330
the keynote, we have the Chrome
data compression.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.960
That's already a nice one
that you can enable.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.300
But as a web developer, I think
another thing that we

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.150
can take away from the keynote
is not only is the web getting

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.700
faster, it's also getting more
ambitious in terms of the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.050
applications that we're
building, which is why we care

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.870
about rendering performance
like 60FPS in a browser.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.435
For game developers, this has
been a day-to-day thing.

00:02:55.435 --> 00:02:57.910
For a lot of web developers,
this is a new concept.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.800
So upstairs we're talking people
through the steps of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.310
what are the tools in Chrome
that can help you figure out

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.890
what are the rendering
bottlenecks?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130
Maybe you have a CPU bottleneck,
a compute

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.400
bottleneck, or maybe
it's networking.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.270
So, for example, for networking
we have a suite of

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.520
tools called Page Speed, which
is basically like a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.380
performance linter.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.050
You run analyze, and it tells
you here are the 10 things you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.630
should fix right now.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.700
And then we can also provide
some tools to help you

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.302
automate that web performance
best practice, which is great.

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:26.850
LOUIS GRAY: Isn't it true you
never really eliminate the

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.270
bottleneck.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.400
You just move it to
a different place?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.840
ILYA GRIGORIK: Absolutely.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.880
That's what happens.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.080
LOUIS GRAY: And that's the way
we always learned that.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.780
I mean, if you get out of this
spot, you're going to find

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.690
something else that's hot.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.020
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.170
LOUIS GRAY: So you're talking
about really like a

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.000
performance analysis service,
finding the best stuff, and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.250
finding how you can
optimize for that.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.270
I know we often have
you online at GDL.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.910
I appreciate you coming
on and talking about

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.510
making the web fast.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.750
What are those things that web
developers can really key on

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.240
to try and make their pages
load more quickly?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.150
What are the things that really
are the slowdowns?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.290
I think one of the pieces that
was touched on in the keynote

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.350
was the option to get away
from possibly JPEG

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.100
and moving to WebP.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.430
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.850
LOUIS GRAY: Can you talk
a little bit about that

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.430
compression and things
that are out there?

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.630
ILYA GRIGORIK: That's a
really cool example.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.460
So it turns out for an average
page on the web today, over

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.460
60% of all of the data

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.620
transferred is actually images.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.650
So we're building pages which
are very media-heavy, lots and

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.750
lots of images.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.250
And with WebP, we can actually
give or provide about 30%

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.070
better compression over JPEG.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.390
And what we didn't mention in
the keynote was an 80% win

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.240
over PNGs, which we often used
for alpha channel and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.730
transparencies, which
are very popular in

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.370
games and other places.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.440
So you put those two things
together by using something

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.050
like a WebP format and you get
a huge savings, which fewer

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.510
bytes transferred, which makes
the page load faster.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.310
It also decreases the
cost of your page.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.370
I think it's something that we
forget on our 4G connections.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.460
For a lot of users, bytes are
expensive, so reducing that

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.540
amount is actually very,
very beneficial.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.930
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
4G connections.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.630
I'm going to date myself a
little bit and go back to

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.580
talking about modems.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.220
ILYA GRIGORIK: Sure.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.620
LOUIS GRAY: So the web, they
just announced its 20th

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.930
anniversary essentially.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.970
And so some of us have been
using the web for a long time.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.880
And some of us were using
Mosaic and Netscape

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.440
Communicator and all those cool
things, where you had

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.870
essentially gray pages with
blue links, and when you

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.970
clicked through, you would
get to text files.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.040
And you had to do that, because
the downloading speed

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.900
wasn't even possible
to load an image.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.930
And it was painful to download
hundreds of kilobytes of data,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.820
which are things we absolutely
take for granted.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.900
And I think often what we run
into is if you have a pipe and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.880
you make that pipe bigger, the
people who are designing your

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.550
apps are going to
fill that pipe.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.120
And so how do you manage that
kind of one-upmanship on the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.140
equipment side that's really
sucking down the data to the

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.380
people that are creating bigger
and more greater apps?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.890
ILYA GRIGORIK: I think it's
a challenge to both us

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.530
developers on Chrome
and Google and

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.720
all the rest to make--

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.110
so we want to build more
ambitious applications.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.360
We want life streaming
to happen.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.400
We want to deliver rich media,
rich games in the browser and

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.070
all the rest.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.950
So developers keep pushing us
to build more ambitious

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.430
applications, which means
we need to improve the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.920
performance of the web, the
performance of the browser.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.620
But it is a collaboration.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.130
We can't fix everything within
Chrome, which is why we have

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.340
the performance area, where
developers can come, show us

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.310
their application, and it gives
us feedback as a browser

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.490
developer to say, here are the
things that we need to

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.290
address, help developers fix,
or vice versa, like we were

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.942
not educating developers
about something.

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:22.830
LOUIS GRAY: What is it about
Chrome specifically that makes

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.140
you say it's speedier?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.780
What is it that we
can test on?

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.820
And what's different
about that browser?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.690
COLT MCANLIS: Well, from the
ground up, we always focus on

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.190
performance.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.990
I mean, that's one of the
cornerstones of Chrome that

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.610
started in the beginning was we
need to make a faster, more

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.090
secure browser for people,
because that enhances the web

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.360
experience for everyone.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.060
The browsers get better,
the web gets better,

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.240
everyone gets happier.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.430
So we do a lot of things across
network, compute, and

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.750
render to make sure
this happens.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.970
V8 is by far one of the top
JavaScript VMs out there.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.350
The way we handle rendering and
our utilization of the GPU

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.610
is top tier.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.060
We do things that no
other browsers can

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.150
do just right now.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.320
Networking, we do a lot of great
stuff, like the Flywheel

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.970
technology, as well as the way
we're compressing the network

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.370
transfer stuff.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.320
ILYA GRIGORIK: A really cool
example with network is Chrome

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.110
literally learns the topology
of the web.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.270
And it becomes faster
the more you use it.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.700
We learn your browsing
patterns.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.250
And next time you open the
Google News homepage, we say,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.230
hey, we can preload these other
pages to make it seem

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.900
faster, pre-rendering and other
tricks under the hood.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.360
LOUIS GRAY: So a lot of
precaching and fetching of

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.700
pages that I might go to in the

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.260
future, almost like cheating.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.150
I think one thing that Linus,
I believe it was, touched on

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.080
today, they looked at the
performance of Chrome on

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.600
JavaScript, both on desktop
and on mobile.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.730
And on the desktop side, year
over year, maybe we

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.420
increased by 50%.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.840
And I apologize if I get
the number wrong.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.210
And in mobile, it practically
doubled.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.130
And so when you look at mobile,
how important is

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.730
making the web fast relative
to desktop?

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.940
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, it's
everything right now.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.020
As we've already talked about,
the amount of content coming

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.910
from mobile platforms is
eclipsing desktop.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.600
More and more and more
we're seeing that.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.810
And especially it's becoming
the life force for a lot of

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.870
these small businesses that rely
on mobile for their input

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.470
and their income.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.710
A user visiting a website
has a different sort of

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.330
expectation when they
visit it on mobile

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.580
than they do on desktop.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.590
And so decreasing the load
time, increasing the

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.420
performance is going to be
critical for these guys to

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.970
stay afloat as the technology
moves forward.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.550
LOUIS GRAY: Well, I know we
actually did this pretty fast.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.530
It's good for guys
who are doing

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.960
performance to talk quick.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.770
And I appreciate your
performance on it.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.370
I appreciate you joining
us at GDL at I/O.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.820
For those of you who are on the
live stream, we're going

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.640
to get back to your
sessions next.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.660
And follow us again.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.375
We'll be GDL at I/O again at
5:20 talking about Drive.

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.625
See you there.
