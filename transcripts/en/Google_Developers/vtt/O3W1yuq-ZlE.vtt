PAUL IRISH: Hello,
hi, so I'm going

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.820
to show a little bit around
using the Chrome Developer

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.800
tools and how to have
a productive workflow

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.960
in developing, also
capturing developing

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.200
for the mobile web and some
more performance stuff.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.830
So first up, we're going
to dive into workflow,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.895
and so optimizing
how fast we can

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.180
iterate when we're
doing development.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.500
To do this, I'm going to demo.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.480
And so I'm going to try
and put this in my pocket.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.980
How's that?

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.356
Does that work?

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.180
OK, that's not awkward at all.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.370
All right, so we're going
to come out to this.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.690
This is a site that I work
on with some friends called

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.300
HTML5 Please.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.220
And let's say I just want to
make some changes on this site.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.870
So I'm just hosting it.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.100
I have a local server
on localhost:8000.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.470
And I want to make some changes.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.746
All right, so let's
see, I'm going

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:13.610
to open up the Chrome
Developer tools,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.650
select this, and
make some changes.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.850
Maybe I'm going to bring the
font size down a little bit,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.760
add in a new color-- it
doesn't look very good.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.880
Let me try-- I'll
change this over

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.640
to blue for now-- OK, sure.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.680
Now normally how this works is
that I will take this and take

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.760
the changes that I like, and
copy them, and then come over

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.960
to my text file-- say it's right
here-- and paste it in, right?

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.060
And that's how I would
probably normally do it.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.580
But that's not very good.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.910
So what we can actually do
is we can combine the two.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.060
And so what we're
going to do is use

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.740
a new feature called Workspaces.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.295
And this allows me
to kind of mount

00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:12.320
in my code, my local
development folder, into Chrome

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.150
and just be able to save
directly back to disk

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.600
with all my changes.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
So this is how it works.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.810
First, I'll just
refresh the page.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.930
OK, and now I right click
in the Sources panel.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.880
And I can select Add
Folder to Workspace.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.370
So everyone can see
this-- down there.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.189
Now, that comes up.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.480
And I want to select what
folder I'm going to bring in.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.120
And here's my local
folder for this project.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.200
So I say, Yes and Allow.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.270
All right, now we
can see it here.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.500
And so here's my local folder.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.850
And so this has
everything, all the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.240
files in it, say, for
instance, my configuration

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.130
for Sass, my gitignore.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280
I can make any changes here.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.320
And also, if, say
for instance, I

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.600
make a new file,
that also comes in.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.470
And I can see that.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.400
So hello, hello,
and then-- right.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.150
So, nice, I have a mapping
between what I have on disk

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.150
and what I have inside
Chrome in full persistence.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.140
The way this gets
interesting is being

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.760
able to manipulate the
styles, or whatever else,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.670
like we all want to.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.780
So let's do some of that.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.210
So I was making some
changes here before.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.580
And then, we'll bring down this
font size and select this guy.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.450
We'll change him--
ooh, that's pretty.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.010
That's nice.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.230
I like this.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.140
So that's good.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:12.510
And now, when I come over
to-- ah, one mistake.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.410
One thing that I need to do
once I mount in this folder

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.570
is to map it.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.240
I need to map it
to my other assets.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.970
So I have my script that's
coming from local host.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.470
But I need to tell Chrome
than it needs to match.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.590
So what I do-- this
is a one-time set-up--

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.270
I need to map file
to local resource.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.470
So I select the
one that matches.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.420
And that's it-- yes.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:54.580
OK, OK, now I'm going
to come back and make

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.610
this change again.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.825
And I'll add in a new color.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.660
And now when I come
over to my code,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.200
you can see my font
size is now 3M.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.090
My color is blue.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.532
I'll add in a few more border--
10px, solid gray, background,

00:05:19.532 --> 00:05:22.060
hmm, I don't know, green?

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.150
Green-- not improvements,
but they're coming right in.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.760
So this is full
persistence in there.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.370
Now, another way I
could do this is I

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.170
could come in to the Sources
panel and make any changes.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.370
One new change
that we just added

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.680
is if you hold down
the Alt key, you

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.020
can now just hold down Alt
and change these numbers

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.630
just right with Up and Down.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.280
So I can make changes here.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.240
Or I could come over
to my text editor

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.660
and-- say I don't
like green anymore.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.170
I really want purple.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.700
I hit Save in Sublime.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.500
And I come back here, and it's
like, oh sure, no problem.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.160
So this is really nice.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.300
If you do want to continue
to develop over here and make

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.160
any changes, it'll just
come in immediately.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.380
So this is pretty powerful.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.990
And I've showed
it with CSS here.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.570
But it's also really
useful with JavaScript.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:32.090
So on this site, if
I type in this box,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.550
we filter down the
results of what's

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.309
showing up here based on that.

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:39.600
But if I want to get a better
understanding of how that

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.520
works-- maybe I want
to add some console log

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.830
like debug statements
to figure this out.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.990
So let me just close these.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.860
I'm going to hit Command-O
and look for my script file.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.470
And yeah, actually
this is perfect.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.200
So right now, when
I type here, I

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.440
want to get an idea of
how these values come

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.230
into the JavaScript
that's handling this.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.370
So what I can just
do is immediately

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.510
enter in a console
log statement.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.230
And so I'm in the
Update Search Method.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.000
And so I'm just going
to blog that I'm there

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.910
and see what the value is.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:38.030
Now, when I hit Command-S right
now, what Command-S is doing is

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.080
it's persisting
this change to disk.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.220
And then, it's also telling
V8, the JavaScript engine,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.940
that it needs to now
evaluate this new definition

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.210
of this file.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.160
So I'm hitting Command-S. I'm
not refreshing the page at all.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.540
And when I type here,
it immediately changes.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.560
So V8 has a new definition.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.450
And now, if I go over, and
I'll just double check,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.070
here's my changes that I
made to disk on the styles.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.730
Yup, and here's my change
down here to the JavaScript.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.940
So this is nice, because
I can go really fast.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.630
I'm not refreshing the page.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.340
I'm changing both
CSS and JavaScript

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.475
and persisting all the
changes that I like to disk.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.720
One thing I didn't show is--
let's see if this works.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.760
We have full undo and redo.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:41.548
So I'm going to try-- oh
no, I refreshed the page.

00:08:41.548 --> 00:08:46.780
Damn, all right, so if
I make these changes,

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.670
and I don't really
like them, I can just

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:56.630
hit Command-Z to
bring them back.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:01.690
So whether you make changes here
inside the DevTools or changes

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.680
over here, you can
just hit Command-Z

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.050
to kind of work your way back.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:09.220
And all those changes will
be maintained in the files.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.400
So this gets really
powerful, right?

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.270
I can edit the entire project.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.460
Whether it's mark
down files, PHP files,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.380
I can do it right
there in the DevTools.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.190
So the DevTools kind
of becomes my editor.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.100
All the changes persist
to disk, full undo, redo,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.310
and it's nice because I
can maintain my context.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:33.160
If I'm setting break points in
my JavaScript in the DevTools,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.710
I can also edit right there
and make those changes

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.976
and save those to desk.

00:09:37.976 --> 00:09:40.840
All right, the next
thing I want to show

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.370
is the DevTools support
for Sass and Less.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.450
Who writes their
styles using Sass?

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.980
Raise your hand.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.490
Yes, or Less-- Less, a lot
more people are using Less.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.880
Good, OK, this was just
added like two weeks ago.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.680
But let me show
you how this works.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:16.350
So now, one thing
that you might notice

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.590
is that-- let's say I'm going
to select this little item right

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:21.090
here.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:32.630
So this is the little-- Use
Item is what I'm selecting.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.125
And if we look over here,
we have a few styles on it.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.750
And we have just this green and
a green that's a little darker,

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.340
and a green that's a
little darker than that.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.240
But you can see actually where
this definition is coming from.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.390
It's from an SESS file.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.540
So it's not a Sass file.

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.000
It's not a CSS file.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It's an SESS file.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.560
So let me click through on
that and see what's going on.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.460
Oh, let me try that once more.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.640
OK, so here, we're
actually jumping

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.970
to the definition of the mix in.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.302
So the mix in that I wrote
for this Sass kind of

00:11:14.302 --> 00:11:15.010
does some things.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.050
I have a variable coming
in with this color.

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.480
Here's the background box
shot on boarder radius.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.770
But it's taking this color, and
it's kind of darkening it here.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.080
It's darkening it here.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.200
So we're doing some
nice things in the Sass.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.030
But if I want to make a change
to this green, what I could do

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.270
is just take this
and change the color.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.830
But that doesn't
really work, right?

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.740
I have this stuff here.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.490
So clearly, I'm not going
to be able to do this

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.980
by just editing the CSS.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.390
I need to edit the
Sass, the original Sass.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.310
So let's try that.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.540
So if you hold down the
Command key or the Control key,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.650
you'll see an underline.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.790
Let me zoom in on that.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.340
So this command, this
indicates that you

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.620
can jump to the original
location where this is defined.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.630
So here, if I Command
click on background,

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.690
I jump to where
the background is.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.270
But I want to change the color.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.550
So I want to Command click
on that background color.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.650
And now-- whoops.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.460
Well, what I'm
expecting it to do

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.600
is to jump to this
color definition, which

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.830
is in my Variables Sass file.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.480
So what's cool here
is if I want to make

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.350
this change to this
variable definition-- let's

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.210
say I'm going to turn it to
red-- I just hit Command-S,

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:01.750
and I wait.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.250
And I get my changes.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.110
So I just changed
Sass in the DevTools.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.230
And what happened on
the back is over here,

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:17.100
I actually have a tab that
has a little watch, just

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.750
to monitor changes, and have
compass and Sass recompile

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.230
the new CSS.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.960
And so that happened.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.720
And then, DevTools
picked up on the fact

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.150
that the CSS file had changed
and just refreshed it.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.550
So now I can make any sort
of change in the Sass.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.900
And it takes a
little bit of time

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.070
to actually-- there we
go-- for the change happen.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:45.080
But this is really nice.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.270
Because I can go very fast now.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:54.440
All right, so that is a little
bit of the DevTools support.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.660
Like I mentioned, we've had
support for Sass for awhile.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.960
And the guys behind
the Less project

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.920
just added support
inside their compiler

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.380
for creating source
maps, which is

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.140
what powers this whole thing.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.820
So we have support for both.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.680
So this whole story
really creates

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.400
a compelling
development environment

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.870
where I can just-- anywhere
that I type, I can style,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.210
see the immediate results.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.880
Everything is
persistent to disk.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.804
And I get a lot of
immediate feedback.

00:14:26.804 --> 00:14:28.470
All right, but I want
to take this stuff

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.540
and go mobile with it.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.340
So let's do that.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.830
So we're going to
come over here.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.080
And I have my phone.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.240
And this is my password.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.570
All right, so let me
just refresh this.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.450
OK, cool-- focus, yeah, good.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.740
Now I want to do
this development.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.170
And I want to debug
what's on my phone.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.690
So let's try that out.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.180
So I come over to
Chrome Inspect.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.790
You can also just
type, "about inspect."

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:16.870
And now, let's see, I want
to get this on the screen

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.000
at the same time.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.960
There we go.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.535
Now let's plug in the phone.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.800
Doo, doo, doo-- yeah,
woo, all right, cool,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.290
so it just found my phone.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.720
Now raise your hand if you've
done a remote debugging

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.070
with Chrome on Android before--
OK, cool, a few of you.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.410
Before, it required some
things around downloading

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:42.950
the entire Android SDK.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:43.990
It was really painful.

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.710
Now, just plug it in.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.740
It just works.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.870
So we see Chrome.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.910
Chrome 31 is now here.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.860
And I want to load a page.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:01.378
So let's see, I don't
know, load naver.com, sure.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:10.965
All right, cool-- all right, so
I'm just going to hit Inspect.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:21.690
And all right, here's the
DevTools, the full DevTools.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.700
And so if I come
over to Timeline,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.020
and I start a recording,
and I scroll the page,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.940
I'm getting all that stuff.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:29.930
So that's really cool.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.700
Raise your hand if you have
one of these cameras here

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.760
that can take a picture of your
camera and put it on your-- OK,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.330
probably not.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.040
So we thought that
this is a problem.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.910
So let's solve this.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.690
So I'm going to kill this video.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.750
And I'm going to
go into Settings

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.337
and turn on a new experiment
that we've been working on.

00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:53.420
This is called Screencast.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.650
This is the first time that
I've ever showed this publicly.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.210
So this is the debut
of this feature.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.920
I'm really excited.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.579
All right, so what we do is we
close that down and bring that

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.164
back up.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.636
Ahh, and now-- yes.

00:17:19.636 --> 00:17:22.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:22.552 --> 00:17:24.010
PAUL IRISH: So this
is really cool.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.750
So I have-- as I just
scroll, I can see immediately

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.340
what's going on.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.130
So I can just do the same thing.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.400
Right, so that's really nice.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.114
I don't have to go back
and look down at the phone

00:17:40.114 --> 00:17:40.905
and come over here.

00:17:40.905 --> 00:17:43.720
Because it's all right
here on the screen.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.140
So let's do a search.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.440
So I can type and
be like, Chrome.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.560
OK, but this is taking a while.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.590
I'd much rather just
type here on my keyboard.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.897
So let's try that.

00:17:56.897 --> 00:18:02.230
Ah, OK, cool, so I can type.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.900
And let's see.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.480
Let's check.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:16.020
Yeah, all right, I can click.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.870
And the last thing
I want to show here

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.210
is that I can just Inspect
Element, and Inspect Element

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:22.630
works, too.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.310
So I can just select the item.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.800
And my DOM view comes up.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.710
So this is really powerful.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.420
This means that I don't
have to go and muck back

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.420
with my device.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.080
I have it all right
here on screen.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.190
And I have the full
DevTools to support it.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.560
But let's go back to the project
that I was developing before.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:52.785
It was this, localhost:8000.

00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:59.120
And so we'll just open up a
tab with that and inspect it.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.370
Hmm, so one thing-- there we go.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.550
So one thing that happens a
lot is that you want to develop

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.850
localhost:8000.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.690
But your phone doesn't know
what localhost:8000 is.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.460
Because that's your machine.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.160
So the feature that
we have available

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.560
now is port forwarding.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.750
So you can just say, I want
whatever's on this machine.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:39.140
And I want to have it
available on my phone.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:44.930
So now we have this project
right here on the phone.

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.420
And everything that I
showed just a moment ago

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.030
with Workspaces still works.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:55.950
So let's try-- first step, we're
just going to select this text

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.466
and try a different
selection color.

00:19:58.466 --> 00:20:03.310
Ooh yeah, that's nice--
something like that?

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:10.270
OK, good-- come over,
select this text, this H1.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:14.850
And again, we'll change the font
size to be really big-- yeah.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:23.510
And what's great about this is
that these changes that I just

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:29.490
made here while I'm
debugging my phone,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.280
these just saved to disk.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:36.950
So if I now come over
to my other window,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:43.260
this one-- see, this
one-- I refresh.

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.630
Wow, yes-- cool.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.800
So this means I basically can
choose where I want to develop,

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.620
and it's all saving
back to disk, which

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.530
means that I can go really fast,
make changes, and not worry

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.670
about where I have to copy what.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:03.880
All right, so this is how
remote debugging works now.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.962
We have a very
powerful feature set.

00:21:05.962 --> 00:21:07.920
Everything that you can
do in regular developer

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:11.220
tools you can do while
you debug your phone--

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.820
the screen casting
feature, port forwarding.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.760
And it's a lot easier to set
up than it ever was before.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.690
All right, I'm going to
move on to performance.

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:29.270
So first up, these are actually
graphs from Internet Explorer.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.530
They were talking about what
sorts of operations the browser

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.930
does when it's loading
and using pages.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.120
So they looked at the top
100 sites and the top Ajax

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.180
sites, JavaScript-heavy
sites, and looked

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.810
at what the browser is
busy doing on those sites.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.550
And in these cases, the amount
of time actually executing

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.550
JavaScript is pretty low.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.950
A lot of time is just spent
in layout rendering and kind

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.350
of manifesting the page.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.060
So this basically means
that JavaScript is often not

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.310
the bottleneck in
many, many cases.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.100
And you want to be
able to look at and get

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.480
an idea of the performance
of the other parts of what

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.550
the browser has
to do, so not just

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.150
running the JavaScript profile.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.440
So let's talk about
how some of that works.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.100
And to show it, I'm going
to do a little demo where

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.450
I do a performance
audit of this site.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.830
So this is a festival in Canada.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.120
And they have a nice website.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.470
But it could be faster.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.260
So I loaded up the page.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.790
And as I scrolled out--
it might be hard to see.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:45.260
But it's a little--
it doesn't feel

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.910
very smooth as I'm
scrolling here.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.770
It feels like it's stuttering.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.380
So I'm going to take
a look at the DevTools

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.792
and see what they're
telling me about this.

00:22:56.792 --> 00:22:58.250
So I'm going to go
to the timeline.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.874
The timeline is where
you want to start

00:22:59.874 --> 00:23:02.080
all of your performance
investigations.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.340
And I'm going to
start recording.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.800
And here we go.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.080
So immediately, this is giving
me back a lot of information.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.960
And what I'm seeing is a
lot of purple here, right?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.360
And the purple, when I look,
is a lot of recalc style.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.680
Let me raise this up just
so that everyone can see.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.090
So recalc style in
jQuery-- OK, interesting.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.610
So we can look at
what exactly the call

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.840
stack is that forced this.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.330
Add class-- OK, so
we're manipulating

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.950
the class of an element.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.640
And we come down to where the
actual application code is.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.223
And let me just click
through on that.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.940
And it went right here.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.590
So the cursor is telling me
that this is where it happened.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.080
We called toggleClass.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.390
And we're calling toggleClass
inside the Scroll Handler.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.010
So on every single
scroll event, we're

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:08.820
manipulating the class
of the HTML element.

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.460
This-- you know how
people tell you to not

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.010
touch the DOM too much?

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:15.050
This is usually why.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.000
You're manipulating the
class of the HTML element.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.760
And what it's causing is a
lot of performance problems,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.450
all this purple here.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.780
So let's try changing
this and fixing it.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:34.730
One quick fix that we can do is
using-- instead of toggleClass,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:41.460
I'm going to use an HTML5 API,
here we go, called classList.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.360
And classList.toggle actually
has the exact same method

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.830
signature, the same
arguments, as toggleClass.

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.610
So we can just keep
that there, keep this,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.710
and now I'm just going
to hit Command-S.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:09.360
And that should just
send it immediately

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.420
to the JavaScript engine.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.630
So now, when I come back
to Timeline, and I hit

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:16.880
Record again-- ahh.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.910
OK, cool-- it's a
big change, right?

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.790
There's no more purple.

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.590
There's no more
recalculate style.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:30.200
Still, there is a good amount
of green, of painting happening.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.260
So we want to figure
out what that is.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.820
So I'm going to go into
the DevTools settings,

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.160
and I'm going to turn on a mode
called Show Paint Rectangles.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.487
I'm also going to turn on
Show Composited Layer Borders.

00:25:43.487 --> 00:25:45.570
I'm going to get into what
these mean in a second,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.820
but I just kind of want to
figure out what's happening.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:53.870
OK, interesting-- so
you can see as I scroll,

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:59.100
there's this rectangle
above the top nav.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.660
So it's being repainted.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.100
Every single time I
scroll, the browser

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.930
has to re-figure out what
the top of that looks like.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.240
You can't just put the
layers on top of each other.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.150
It's doing a lot of work here.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.160
I want to make that easier.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.730
And so I'm going to
try a few tricks.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.670
So we're going to come in here.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.730
Here's the main navigation.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:25.060
A quick tip is you can
hit H on the keyboard,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.810
and it'll just hide
whatever element

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.100
you're looking at, all right?

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.610
So we have this top nav.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:39.290
And it's actually
position fixed right?

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:48.050
Or-- here we go, it's position
absolute, interesting.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.630
Let me try and see
if we can fix this.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.700
So I'm going to change
this to position fixed.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.510
And-- ahh, OK, here we go.

00:27:04.695 --> 00:27:08.160
All right, position
fixed, and I'm

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.820
going to use a trick
called promoting a layer.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.980
And you might have
seen this before.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.580
It's often called
the translateZ(0)

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.510
or the translate3d hack.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.320
So now I've just
promoted it to a layer.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.580
And you can actually
see this gold border

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.130
around it-- indicates
that it's now a layer.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.520
And now when I try
scrolling, I don't

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.890
have that red paint
rectangle around it.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.710
And I can verify
here in the Timeline

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.050
by just scrolling
up and down-- yeah.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.720
And I've taken care
of that concern.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.450
This particular
trick often happens

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.350
with position fixed elements.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.630
And right now, it's only
particular to Chrome

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:56.990
on desktop.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.610
Pretty much all other browsers,
including mobile browsers,

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.370
have ways of dealing with this.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.290
But it's something
to look out for.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:11.070
All right, so those are a few
of the tricks that you can use.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:14.340
But I want to walk through what
some of those operations were.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.060
The first that you
see is recalc style.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.224
So recalculation of style
gets all the style rules

00:28:20.224 --> 00:28:20.890
in the document.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:24.730
Whether it's in a CSS style
sheet, an in-line style,

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.800
a style tag, it
gets all of them.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.770
And then, it looks at
what all the selectors are

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.010
and matches them
against the DOM.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:38.560
It figures out what elements it
needs to evaluate the style of

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.690
and gets a computed style
of every CSS property

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.340
for every element in the DOM.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.160
All right, once it knows what
all the styles should be,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.740
it needs to apply it.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.317
And this is called the layout.

00:28:52.317 --> 00:28:54.400
Layout is the first step
where it just figures out

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.563
the geometry of where
everything goes in the document.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:05.830
I want to show a problem
called layout thrashing.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:12.720
Layout thrashing happens because
when a browser is laying out

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.550
the geometry of
the page, it also

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.350
needs to figure
out-- if you ask it

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.850
for the current position
or the current width,

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.010
the current size of an element,
the browser's like, oh, OK,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.510
I'll go get that.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.210
But then, if you change
something, it re-lays it out.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.620
And then, there's a bad pattern
that people often fall into.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.220
I'm going to show a little
demonstration right now.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:56.560
All right, come
on-- OK, all right,

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.970
so in this little
demonstration, I

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.530
can change the size of
the green rectangle.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.660
And when I hit Set
Block Width, it goes

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:11.110
and it sets the width of
all the other text blocks.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.960
You can see-- click,
ugh, it takes a while.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.110
Now, there's another
way to do this.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:28.990
And if I try that
way-- ahh much faster.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:32.065
OK, so what's the
difference between the two?

00:30:32.065 --> 00:30:33.190
Let's open up the DevTools.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:40.150
First, I'll turn off these guys.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.850
And I'm going to start
our Timeline recording

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.830
and set that block width.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:55.654
Ooh, OK, so here, you can see
that big pause, that big chunk,

00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:56.320
after I clicked.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.180
All right, so I'll
bring this up.

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.472
Now, you can see here, this
pattern-- recalc style layout,

00:31:04.472 --> 00:31:06.180
recalc style layout,
recalc style layout,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.941
recalc style layout.

00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:13.851
And there's this little
warning indicator telling you

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:15.100
that there might be a problem.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.420
And it says, "Forced
synchronous layout

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.930
is a possible
performance bottleneck."

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.010
And you can see right here
what it's telling you.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.970
There was a layout that was
invalidated at line 125.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:33.252
And the layout was forced to
be recomputed at line 124.

00:31:33.252 --> 00:31:34.585
So let's go look at those lines.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:42.440
All right, so here is line 124.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.500
What we have is
a big while loop.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.130
It's just looping over all
those little text blocks.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.870
And inside that loop,
we get the offset width

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:56.140
of that green
block, of this guy.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.769
And then, we come in and we
set the width of each element.

00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:02.560
So we're setting the
width of each element.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.976
We're going to
look into the size.

00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:07.050
We're setting the width,
going to look into the size.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.990
In the fast version,
which is right here,

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.250
we go and we look up the
width of that block once.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.980
And then, we go and
we do all of our sets

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.970
where we set the widths.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:21.520
So the big thing
to learn here is

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:28.790
that if you need to figure out
the dimensions, if you need

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.130
to ask the DOM
for the dimensions

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:35.130
or sizes of an element,
try and do that only once

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.700
and not interleave it
with changes that you're

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.110
making to the DOM.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.060
But if you ever
have any question,

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.840
just open up the Timeline.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.390
And you'll probably end
up seeing this pattern.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.030
It happens a lot of times.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.960
All right, the next is paint.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.340
Painting often
captures a lot of time.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.860
We were seeing
before all the green.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.730
There's a lot of
time spent in paint.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.279
There's a few ways
to debug when you're

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:06.320
having a lot of painting.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.650
And the first is
Continuous Paint mode.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:12.130
So Continuous Paint
mode allows you

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:16.850
to look at how long
it takes to paint,

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.060
and it allows you to
kind of figure out

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.450
what is contributing to it.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.610
So I'm going to turn it on now.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:29.700
You'll see right here, Enable
Continuous Page Repainting.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.870
All right, so this is it.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.200
What it's telling me is it's
taking about three to four

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.830
milliseconds to paint this page.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.670
And it's just doing it
over and over again.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:47.910
I can verify that down here
by opening the timeline.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:50.480
All right, so what
this allows us to do

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.540
is we can make some
changes and figure out

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:57.960
how to kind of manipulate
what that looks like.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.340
So I'm going to come over
and turn on some box shadows.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:08.230
Wow, OK, cool, so box
shadows definitely

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.510
take a lot more time to paint.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.010
And so that's why we're seeing
the graph really spike up.

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:20.790
I could also, let's see,
try-- if, for instance,

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:25.739
I take this box show, and right
now it has a blur radius of 120

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:32.730
pixels, if I just change that
down to 20 pixels, it's faster.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:35.520
Bring it down even more-- yeah.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.219
So this allows you to kind
of see what affects paint.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:44.060
Oftentimes, box shadow does
currently impact paint cost

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.429
quite a lot.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.130
But Chrome is always
improving things.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:49.400
So that might not be
the same case tomorrow.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:55.460
The next situation
I want to introduce

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.910
is-- we call it paint storms.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:01.130
And pant storms basically
refers to the browser

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.960
is painting the page a lot.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.350
But it really shouldn't have to.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:11.130
So let's take a look at a
situation where that happens.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:15.955
So I'm going to come in here
and set this background--

00:35:15.955 --> 00:35:16.680
all right.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.770
I'm going to come
over to Timeline

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:29.670
and turn off Continuous
Paint for now.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:35.600
And if I turn on Show Paint
Recs, you can see-- actually,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.200
it's a little hard to see.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.540
But the entire
screen is repainting

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.970
on every single scroll.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.750
We can see the paint
action down here.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.306
It has to figure out-- let
me turn on a box shadow,

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:51.430
too, so it hurts even more.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:58.670
Uhh, yeah, that
feels bad, right?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.750
Ouch-- all right,
so what's happening

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.930
is that there's the fixed
background behind all

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.920
this content.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.820
And the browser is
being really slow

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.990
in figuring out-- on
every single scroll,

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:18.570
it is recomputing how that looks
underneath all this content.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:24.910
I'm going to quickly try
and fix this-- we'll see.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:31.150
Doo, doo, doo-- I'm going to
take the fixed background that

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:39.400
is on the body, and I'm going
to create a brand new element.

00:36:43.928 --> 00:36:46.960
Let's put him right here.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.710
And I'm going to cheat.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.270
And I have some code-- hey.

00:36:55.958 --> 00:36:57.690
Hey, what?

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:03.790
No, definitely not--
OK, there we go.

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.780
So I have my div.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.460
And let's drop in that.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.180
OK, yeah, that
seems pretty good.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:18.340
With 100% cover-- there we go.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:23.540
OK, cool, now--
so I've basically

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.880
shifted the background from
the background of the body

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.200
to a div that's within it and
just put z-index as negative 1

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.500
to kind of put it
behind everything.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.650
And I use that trick again,
the translateZ(0) trick,

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:41.200
because it is position fixed.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:45.390
And so you can see now,
there's no red outline.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:51.200
And if I look in the
timeline, there's no activity.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.590
Just to kind of verify that
this indeed does change things,

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.930
I take off that translateZ(0).

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:01.640
It's back.

00:38:06.112 --> 00:38:07.530
It's gone.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:14.080
Cool, so that can be a trick
for fixed backgrounds or fixed

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.490
position elements.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.740
But the big thing that
you want to look for

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.010
is turning on Show
Paint Rectangles

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.540
and seeing if the
entire page is flashing,

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.300
or one section of
the page is flashing,

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.880
while you're scrolling the
page, or while some behavior is

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.630
happening.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.340
That's often a way you can--
there is some improvement

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.590
that you could make.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.090
And you want to
investigate what you

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.050
can do there to make the
experience a lot smoother.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:48.110
All right, moving forward--
I just kind of want

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.510
to point out, if you spend a
lot of time in the timeline,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.840
you want to get a flow
for what operations

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.140
are supposed to happen.

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.890
And this is the
correct kind of flow.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.190
So oftentimes, you'll
have JavaScript that runs.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.210
After that, the styles
need to be recalculated.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:04.730
The geometry of the page
needs to be laid out.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:06.030
Maybe there's paint set-up.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.060
We have to show what
things look like.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.560
And then, we have
to kind of send it

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.400
to the GPU and composite
layers together.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.400
When doing performance
work with the timeline,

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:22.290
this is kind of a cheat sheet
for what tool to use when.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:25.055
If you profile
with the timeline,

00:39:25.055 --> 00:39:27.140
and you're spending a
lot of time in script,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.460
just go to the
JavaScript Profiler.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:34.430
If you're spending a lot of
time in layout, look and figure

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:37.640
out if you have layout
thrashing, things like that.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.120
Paint-- I covered this.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.920
Paint recs, layer borders--
use Continuous Paint mode.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.450
And there's a pro
level feature called

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:51.650
About Tracing, which dives
into the guts of Chrome,

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:53.900
that you can use if none of
these are working for you.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.440
All right, but how do
these all map to CSS?

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:07.060
Just your general
CSS that you write--

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.300
the CSS Selector gets
recomputed in recalc style.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.760
The height, because it's
the geometry of the element,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.010
is what size it is
and its position.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.440
That affects layout.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.050
And a text shadow doesn't affect
the layout of the page at all.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.670
It only affects how it looks.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.814
It's a visual effect.

00:40:23.814 --> 00:40:25.480
And so that's captured
underneath paint.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.820
So there's actually--
between all

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.630
the different CSS
properties, they

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:38.190
affect different parts
of all these operations.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:44.360
Transform and opacity can
be operated 100% on the GPU.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:47.910
This is really good.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.200
Basically, GPUs are
fantastic at doing

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.620
these sorts of operations.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.410
But everything else needs to go
through a little bit more work.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.730
Box shadow, border
radius, and background

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:59.640
just need to be painted.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.430
But they don't affect
the geometry, the layout.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.970
And like I mentioned,
width, margin, border,

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.660
those sorts of things,
those do layout.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.670
So if you're doing an
animation, like you're

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.780
animating an item
across the page,

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.380
or you're increasing the
height of an element, the less

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.630
work that you can
do, the better.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:23.100
If all you can change is just
the transform and opacity,

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.780
it's probably going to be a
lot faster than if you try

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.000
and animate left
and top or width.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.280
So try and animate these guys.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:38.560
Here's another way
to look at that.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.690
There's four things that a
browser can transition really

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:42.550
fast.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.940
They can scale, move,
rotate, and fade.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:51.340
That maps over to our
transforms and our opacity.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:56.280
Sometimes, you do need to
apply that translateZ(0).

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:59.000
Everything else that you
translate, that you animate,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.630
might take more work.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.850
And so just be aware of that.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.950
Especially on older
phones, animating something

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:10.940
like left and top or
width is going to be slow.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.355
So if you want things
to be fast on mobile,

00:42:13.355 --> 00:42:18.090
try and animate
only those things.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:24.929
All right, I just want
to quickly try and show

00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:27.220
the difference of what this
looks like in the DevTools.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:31.320
I have this table here.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.230
And this is kind of
a fun little app that

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:39.520
lets you see how different
CSS properties animate.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.080
It's nice.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.310
Let's take a look
at what changes

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.870
all these things affect
in the web browser.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:55.740
So we'll open up the
DevTools and come down here.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.960
All right, so
here, we have left.

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:00.950
Here we have top.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.220
We're animating the top.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.306
And here's transform.

00:43:04.306 --> 00:43:05.930
And if I come in,
I'm going to turn off

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:10.797
Show Paint Rectangles for
now and go to Timeline-- yes.

00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:11.630
I'll do a recording.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.272
There we go.

00:43:17.272 --> 00:43:18.730
So here, in this
recording, you can

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:22.710
see we're going through
recalc style, layout, paint,

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:23.530
composite layers.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:33.810
When I do transform--
oops-- all we're doing

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:36.492
is just painting and
composite layers.

00:43:36.492 --> 00:43:37.950
And that's all the
work that we do.

00:43:40.534 --> 00:43:48.130
Yeah, so the best ways to
do an animation, if you can,

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.720
is to not use JavaScript.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.420
If you can do it completely in
key frame animations or a CSS

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.670
transition, browsers can
optimize that really,

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:57.730
really well.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:02.220
Once you use jQuery to animate,
it's going to be a lot slower.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:07.920
Because the browser can't
predict what's happening next.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.610
All right, let's move on.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.080
I was going to talk a little
bit about how to figure out

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.200
when sites are done loading.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.100
And there's a
fantastic measurement.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.120
And it's called the speed index.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.180
It basically
evaluates how long it

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.280
takes to get a visual
on the page of what

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.260
the page is supposed
to look like.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.880
It's a really nice
metric and captures

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.150
when the page has completed
loading a lot better

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.160
than window.load or
DOM content ready.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.850
So it's called the speed index.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:50.320
And right now, you can use
Web Page Test to look at it.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.100
Web Page Test-- raise
your hand if you've

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.426
used Web Page Test before.

00:44:54.426 --> 00:44:58.820
A few people, yeah--
it's really fantastic.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.940
So I'm going to show quickly
what the results look like.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.680
So I did an analysis for
a site called RetailMeNot.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.990
And in it, you get
the network waterfall.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.720
But a really nice view
is the film strip view

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.180
where you can see
this network waterfall

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:24.080
against the visual
representation.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.070
So I can scroll and
kind of see as resources

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.660
were loaded what did
the page look like.

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:36.120
And here, at 0.9 seconds, we
finally got to see something.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:42.640
It can also capture what the
Chrome DevTools Timeline will

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:45.890
look like for this
exact recording.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.690
The Chrome DevTools
is a web app.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.930
So we can just load up
the Chrome DevTools using

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:57.380
that recording and see if we
see any of those patterns.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:03.762
Big layout, timers-- yeah,
this site was really fast,

00:46:03.762 --> 00:46:04.970
so there's not much optimize.

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:15.070
And lastly, they also do Show
and Capture the Speed Index.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.960
So a really nice
thing that you can do

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:24.140
is have Web Page Test track
the performance of your page.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:28.360
Do a test once a day, and you
can see its progress over time,

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.480
and see if you're
actually improving

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.410
how fast that page loads.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.730
It's possible to run a
completely private instance.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:38.910
You can send it.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:44.080
You can ask a Chrome or
an IE8 or IE9 in the cloud

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.220
to evaluate the page.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.691
Or you can also
run it internally

00:46:46.691 --> 00:46:48.690
if you want to evaluate
it against a site that's

00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.590
in development.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:59.350
All right, so to sum up, users
expect things to be fast.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:03.970
Under 100 milliseconds
is good for showing

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:05.760
a user that it's happening.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.360
But it starts to
get really stuttery

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.060
when it comes to animation.

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.546
Anything longer than
one second is just

00:47:12.546 --> 00:47:13.670
going to take way too long.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:16.950
So you want to be really attuned
to how fast your page loads

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.970
and how fast the
interactions are.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.320
These are some
aggressive but good goals

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.660
to kind of think about.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.660
When it comes to delivering
an experience on mobile,

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.540
you really want to
show the content that's

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:32.820
above the fold, the content that
the user sees when they first

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:36.670
load up the page, in under
one second from after they

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:40.710
click a button, click a link,
or finish typing in a URL.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.450
Under one second is a good goal.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.150
One of the things that has to
happen to be able to do this

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.800
is serve all the
content that you

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.435
need to for that above the
fold content in under 14K.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:58.730
That includes any CSS that
is required for that section.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.670
But if you have CSS that
applies to the rest of the page,

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:05.740
you can defer that and
send that part later.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:14.940
Oh, well, OK, all right,
lastly-- a maximum

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.790
of 200 milliseconds
for the server

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:21.960
to respond with the page, 60 FPS
scrolling, 60 FPS transitions,

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:28.264
keep things fast, and a
speed index under 1,000.

00:48:28.264 --> 00:48:30.680
I showed you a lot of things
in the Chrome Developer tools

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.960
today.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.100
We have been working
on our documentation.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.300
So this covers a lot of
the functionality that's

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.480
in there, things that
you might not expect.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:42.970
So I encourage you
to go check that out.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.530
And everything that I showed
is available in Chrome Canary

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.010
today.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:52.245
And one more thing--
is Jimmy Moon here?

00:48:52.245 --> 00:48:54.048
He is, oh good.

00:48:54.048 --> 00:48:56.278
OK, great, hi, Jimmy.

00:48:56.278 --> 00:48:58.190
Jimmy's awesome.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.895
And we met actually at
Google I/O not too long ago.

00:49:01.895 --> 00:49:04.790
He's a JavaScript
developer here in Seoul.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:08.230
And he's been really active
on the Yeomen project.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:12.700
He also maintains the generators
for the Chrome apps and Chrome

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.310
extensions.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:15.410
And a lot of people use these.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.020
He's also working
on a brand new site

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.436
that I encourage
you to check out.

00:49:18.436 --> 00:49:20.140
It's called Chromist.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.450
And he wrote about Polymer
just the other day.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:24.670
And it's really fantastic.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.830
So I encourage you
to check that out.

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.280
And I just wanted
to thank you, Jimmy,

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.432
because you're fantastic.

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.390
So thank you very much.

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:32.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:34.972
PAUL IRISH: And
that's it for me, too.

00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:36.680
Thank you guys very
much-- appreciate it.

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:51.449
[APPLAUSE]
