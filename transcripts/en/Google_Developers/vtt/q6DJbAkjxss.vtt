PAUL KINLAN: Hello, and welcome
to another Chrome

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.630
Mobile Thursday.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.020
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.210
PAUL KINLAN: Yes, I got that
wrong in an earlier take.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.230
Anyway, this episode
is about media.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.290
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.980
I'm with Sam Dutton, developer
advocate from Google Chrome.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830
And today's about
media mobile.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.420
Media's an area--

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.024
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:07.910
PAUL KINLAN: It's an area
that you specialize in.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.220
In particular, it's about
media on mobile as well.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.395
So a lot of people think of
video and everything--

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.310
everything to do with video
is mainly desktop-based.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.748
A lot of people think
that you can only

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.620
play videos on desktops.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.440
Obviously, that's not true.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.190
We can do it on mobiles.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.570
But we've got a nice
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.730
new things coming inside
Chrome for Cran--

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.295
Chrome for Crandroid?--

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:31.990
Chrome for Android, at least.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.020
SAM DUTTON: Crandoid
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.990
PAUL KINLAN: getUserMedia's a
big one, so I've been able to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.560
actually get access
to the webcam.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.680
There's a thing called
getUserMedia with Constraints

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.200
which I know you're going
to talk about as well.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.910
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, a
little demo there.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.260
PAUL KINLAN: Track Elements,
WebRTC--

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.490
have we got WebRTC today?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.370
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.810
Hopefully.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.160
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, we've got
a little bit of WebRTC.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.600
Hopefully, we'll show you
something really cool.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.130
SAM DUTTON: If the connectivity
gods are with us.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.400
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I've
seen a really good

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.370
demo out today, actually.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.280
So if that all works, we're
going to have something really

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.466
cool to show.

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:58.310
But yeah, without much further
ado, I'll pass

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.190
you across to Sam.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.970
And Sam will tell you all
the awesome things

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.750
about media and mobile.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.110
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.460
So I'm going to show
you some stuff.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.850
We've got a stack of new APIs
being implemented for mobile,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.020
which is really great to see,
because it's a kind of natural

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.150
home for video, I think.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.850
You know, people using devices
when they're out and about.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.680
And being able to enjoy video
from their phones and their

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.900
tablets and so on.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.720
So straight up, I just wanted
to get us into a little

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.280
demonstration of something
that's new

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.620
for Chrome for Android.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.210
And I think actually for
Firefox, for mobile as well--

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.450
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.140
SAM DUTTON: which is great.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.580
Which is Get User Media.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.880
We've got the WebRTC APIs coming
into mobile for Firefox

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.030
and for Android Chrome.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.730
And that means getUserMedia, RTC
peer connection-- that's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.400
the thing for communicating
audio and video.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.430
And the other one, which is
RTC Data Channel, which is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.060
like WebSockets but
peer-to-peer, between

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.620
browsers, really fast.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.900
Arbitary data communication.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.550
Anyway, so just diving in, I
wanted to show you the state

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.130
of getUserMedia on mobile.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.980
If we have a look at the Nexus
we've got here, you can see

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.060
we've got that running this
really simple getUserMedia

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.760
demo which is at
simple.info/gum.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.370
And then if we look at the code
for that on the desktop

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.620
machine, I just wanted to show
you how damn simple it is now.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.220
We've got a bit of faff at the
top there with navigating

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.475
getUserMedia.

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:37.030
PAUL KINLAN: Oh,
another camera.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.750
That's the actual camera
pointing up at the--

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.940
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
that's right.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.310
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.000
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, it's
a bit weird.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.970
Don't put my hand over it.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.130
You can kind of see
what's going on.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.930
Now we've got to get
getUserMedia.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.570
We've got some stuff in there
to cope with the different

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.780
implementations.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.770
And then you'll see below
that, we've got

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.980
a constraint object.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.770
I'll talk a bit more
about that later.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.890
And then when--

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.810
if we go down the code here,
you'll see when the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.730
getUserMedia call is made, we
pass at the constraints, a

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.120
success call back and
an error call back.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.560
And the success callback
is right there.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.740
And I've actually put
this example--

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.810
the stream object so you can
access it from the console.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.050
That's why that line's
in there.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.480
But really, everything is done
here in that line video.src,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.730
window.URL.creat
eObjectURL(localMediaStream).

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.840
That's it.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.570
And that's setting the
source of the video--

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.060
works on mobile devices and it
works on Firefox, Opera--

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.950
PAUL KINLAN: So which
version of Chrome

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.590
is that at the moment?

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.290
Is that the beta channel?

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.510
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, no, this
is working in stable.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.590
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, getUserMedia,
wow.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.790
SAM DUTTON: I'm sorry,
on mobile.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.420
It's in beta.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.420
PAUL KINLAN: OK, I agree.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.960
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.170
On desktop, it's in stable and
likewise, yeah, we're seeing

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.110
that in Firefox.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.400
PAUL KINLAN: You know I've
got a little question.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.290
I don't know whether
this is a--

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.260
SAM DUTTON: Try me.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.010
PAUL KINLAN: So I've always
wondered about getUserMedia.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.010
It seems to start the actual
session off to actually get

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.770
the video camera
and everything.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.750
How do you end it?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.210
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.180
Yeah, well, you can
stop the stream.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.970
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so this
local stream--

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.250
local media stream--

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.950
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.640
PAUL KINLAN: --you
got there is a--

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.940
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.650
Let's see if it works.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.410
It might work.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.550
So I've got stream--

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.800
if we have a look actually, I
don't know if we can see that.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.560
But I've put the-- like I said,
the stream variable in

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.420
global scope.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.060
And yeah, we should, I think,
be able to stop that.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.660
Let's try that.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.970
Let's see if that worked.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.510
Yes, it did.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.820
PAUL KINLAN: Oh wow.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.080
Awesome.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.500
SAM DUTTON: See, I'm moving my
hand over the camera and

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.930
nothing's happening, because
I've stopped it.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.326
And, yeah, that's it.

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:40.000
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.820
SAM DUTTON: So that's
how you can stop

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.140
the camera from recording.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.600
PAUL KINLAN: Ah, nice.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.700
SAM DUTTON: I've got a simple
way of doing it.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.740
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I've always
wondered about that one,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.150
because I was like oh my god,
it's got access to the camera

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.660
all the time.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.820
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.510
So, look, I'll just demonstrate,
actually, just to

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.570
show what it looks like on the
device in terms of the

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.440
permissions, because this
is really important.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.460
We need to make absolutely sure
that people know when

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.150
they're recording stuff.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.150
So we've got the bar at the
top there with allow/deny.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.700
And there is, I'd say, no way
you can do that without having

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.510
explicitly--

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.880
PAUL KINLAN: One of the
questions that Remy Sharp had

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.780
the other day was can you
select the camera?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.440
I know it doesn't make much
difference on the Nexus 7,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.880
because you only have a
front-facing camera.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.550
SAM DUTTON: Now that's
interesting.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.220
So that brings me to my next
topic, which is strengths.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.605
PAUL KINLAN: Nice segue.

00:06:22.605 --> 00:06:23.140
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, I like it.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.100
PAUL KINLAN: It's as
if we planned it.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.220
SAM DUTTON: It's kind
of like that.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.170
Yeah.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.020
So, in fact, if we go to this
very similar looking demo on

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.880
the device, this is exactly
like the previous demo.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.140
But if we get into the code
for this in the DevTools--

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.430
PAUL KINLAN: Just so everyone
knows at the moment, you have

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.630
actually connected DevTools
up to the mobile device.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.220
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.570
So I'm taking that
through actually.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.140
PAUL KINLAN: No, that's good.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.290
It's one of those things that
we're trying to push quite a

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.450
lot at the moment.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.965
There's a command called ADB,
and you can basically forward

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:58.090
all the requests from the
Android developer took kit at

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.980
the moment to the
mobile device.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.590
And that's how you've got this
DevTools [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.305
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

00:07:02.305 --> 00:07:04.335
PAUL KINLAN: It's not any
special kit or rig.

00:07:04.335 --> 00:07:07.170
It's literally just a USB cable
straight to the device.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.745
SAM DUTTON: Yep.

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.800
Got the USB plugged
in there, and then

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.260
just run the ADB command.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.900
And yeah, it goes.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.580
And then on the desktop machine,
local host, 9222, and

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.860
we get the full suite
of DevTools.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.330
Fantastic.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.280
Yeah, if we look through, you
can see the elements we got

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.250
here on the page.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.750
We've got video there,
and so on and so on.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.870
But if we go back to the
sources, you can see this is

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.280
really kind of the same
as the previous one.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.090
But we have this constraints
object which now has some

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.230
mandatory rules.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.940
And what I've said here is
that the max width of the

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.083
video that we're going to take
for the stream is 360.

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:51.060
That means 360 pixels.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.830
Now the thing is that if we look
at the elements here--

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.170
let's look at that
video element.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.670
Look at the metrics for that.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.870
What you'll see is that
we've actually got

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.420
the size there at--

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.000
it's giving actually the size
of the video itself.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.570
But what happens is that the
sizes that videos can be in

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.450
terms of their resolution
are actually

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.240
constrained to a fixed set.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.820
At the moment, we
have no scaling,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.590
and we have no cropping.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.395
So essentially--

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:25.190
PAUL KINLAN: What's that mean?

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.330
SAM DUTTON: What that means is
that if you set the max width

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.690
of the video that you get from
the stream to be 360, that

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.785
doesn't mean that it will
take it to 360.

00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:40.785
It will drop it to a fixed
set of sizes--

00:08:40.785 --> 00:08:42.289
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so it could
make it 240 width.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:42.970
SAM DUTTON: --less that that.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.900
PAUL KINLAN: OK, I got you.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.780
SAM DUTTON: And we'll give
the links later.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.330
But there's essentially a
fixed set of constraints

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.810
resolution sizes.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.480
So dimensions x and
y dimensions

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.290
for the video stream.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.060
PAUL KINLAN: So what other type
of mandatory options are

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.750
there on this?

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.950
SAM DUTTON: So we can specify
the width and height of the

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.280
stream which is implemented
now in Chrome.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.430
And also planned is
the implementation

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.320
for the frame rates.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.270
So you could specify that you
want a particular frame rate--

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.910
slow or whatever.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.802
And yeah, to get back to your
question, we're also going to

00:09:18.802 --> 00:09:21.140
be able to specify the front
and back cameras there.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.610
So that's where that
will live.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.680
That hasn't been implemented
yet.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.170
And this is pretty
new stuff, so the

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.470
standards is still in flux.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.830
PAUL KINLAN: OK, so it's
actually going to be a

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.060
programmatic thing, rather
than a user option.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.540
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.870
So there's two things
that go on.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.980
You can specify which cameras
you want to use.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:45.460
And then when you select the
device from Allow, you can

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.880
select which camera you want
to use from there as well.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.620
PAUL KINLAN: Right, OK, cool.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.930
So if you wanted to do, like,
a flip of the camera, like

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.560
between front facing and the
back facing, you would

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.310
essentially stop the stream and
then redo getUserMedia but

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.540
with the front-facing camera
as one of the options.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.950
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, that's a
good question actually.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.570
You would have to do
that at this point.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.850
I can see that you might want to
be able to do that without

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:08.030
re-initiating the
whole process.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.500
It is tricky because of course
there's this issue of privacy

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.770
that you don't want to be able
to flip between cameras

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.160
without the user giving
permission for that.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.040
PAUL KINLAN: I got you.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.090
Understood.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.710
So does this apply for
audio as well?

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.590
I know that--

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.940
and we're not really touching
on audio today.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.170
But are there constraints
for audio as well?

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.810
SAM DUTTON: Yes, there are.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.500
Yeah, I haven't seen those
implemented yet.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.060
But yeah, there should be some
constraints about the kind of

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.420
audio you can get in there, just
as there is for video.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.620
PAUL KINLAN: OK, well, cool.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.160
Because I remember when this was
first done, this API, and

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.660
the original constraints were
a string of audio-comma

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.670
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah,
that's right.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.765
PAUL KINLAN: And it's like audio
true, audio, false or

00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:46.580
video false or whatever it is.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.800
SAM DUTTON: So audio lives
in here, like, you can--

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.840
I've just got a video here.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:55.210
But if I put in audio there as
well, we can get the audio

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:56.880
from the microphone as well.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.250
PAUL KINLAN: Can you-- are there
optional constraints--

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.020
think of optional constraints?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.100
SAM DUTTON: Yes, that's right.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.050
So there's various degrees.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:06.950
I'm not even sure whether I can
remember on the standard

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.390
now what they are, but
there are optional

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.130
constraints and mandatory.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:13.600
So depending on what's available
on the device.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.920
Whether you would
like to specify

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.950
frame rate or whatever.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.320
Or whether you are saying
don't let us

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.213
work if it's not available.

00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:27.740
And one thing, just while I
remember to think about with

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.560
these constraints is that you
get a rather unintuitive error

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.620
message if you get them wrong.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.110
It's just kind of "permission
denied." So, yeah, if you're

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:39.830
messing around with constraints,
you get something

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.130
like that, just bear
that in mind.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.265
Because that can be
quite perplexing.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.090
PAUL KINLAN: So the--

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.800
I've forgotten what the
next question was now.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.460
SAM DUTTON: All right
then now.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:50.960
PAUL KINLAN: I know.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.520
Should we just make up
a question poll?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.170
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, go on.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:53.790
PAUL KINLAN: Paula, producer,
do you have

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.060
a question as well?

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.440
No?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.210
SAM DUTTON: No, you
saw it, yeah.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.030
PAUL KINLAN: Actually,
I know what it was.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.900
It wasn't even a question.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.610
It was these demos that you
have, we have a link

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.430
to them, don't we?

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.810
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, we do.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.680
PAUL KINLAN: We're going to pop
that up on the screen in a

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.680
couple of seconds.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.670
Yeah, so if anyone wants to
try these out. you can

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.760
definitely try them out
with Android Chrome.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.310
SAM DUTTON: That's
right, yeah.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.740
PAUL KINLAN: Beta
at the moment.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.660
You could try them
out on probably

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.150
Firefox Android as well.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.050
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, let's--

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.480
PAUL KINLAN: I'm not sure
about Opera just yet.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.010
But they'll also work on
the desktop as well.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.180
So we've got pretty good support
for getUserMedia

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.920
across a variety of
the browsers.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.130
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, actually,
while we're there, I'll just

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.380
show you on the device.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.790
The flag needs to be
set for WebRTC.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.680
And if you go to Chrome/flag--

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.250
like about hyphen flags--

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.580
and you can do Find on page is
really the easiest way to find

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.430
the WebRTC.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.390
PAUL KINLAN: But getUserMedia
hidden behind

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:45.800
that flag we well--

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.330
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:46.580
PAUL KINLAN: Not a
separate flag.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.900
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, and
then you enable--

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.680
you can see it.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.520
It's enabled there, yes.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.620
So that needs to be done in
order to use these demos.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.410
By the way, while we're there,
don't forget the really handy

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.970
Chrome URLs page if you
forget any of these.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.610
It's a really useful spot to--

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.120
PAUL KINLAN: So what
are Chrome URLs do?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.350
SAM DUTTON: So
chrome://chrome-urls gives you

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.070
a full list of all the
Chrome URLs like--

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.966
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, there's
one called WebRTC.

00:13:13.966 --> 00:13:15.440
SAM DUTTON: --sys
internals and--

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.440
actually I noticed the WebRTC
one isn't there at the moment.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.930
PAUL KINLAN: What does
WebRTC internals do.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.140
SAM DUTTON: I'll show
that later actually.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.630
That shows you what's going
on with the current WebRTC

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.540
sessions, which is
really nice.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.140
PAUL KINLAN: So that's
getUserMedia.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.060
It's still pretty new.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.140
And we got quite a lot
to talk about today.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.200
So I think we should probably
jump onto the next topic.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.860
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, let's
move on a bit.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.180
PAUL KINLAN: It's the track
element, right?

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:41.280
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.910
PAUL KINLAN: So do you want to
explain to everything what the

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.550
track element is?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.300
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.790
If we look at the track-- maybe
if I just demo this, I

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.390
think it might be the
simplest way.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.630
So the track element was
designed as a way of getting

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.310
captions and subtitles
and stuff like timed

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.740
metadata into video.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:05.190
So if we play this video, as you
can see I'm getting-- it's

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.760
a little bit hard to see on the
camera-- but you can see

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.830
that I've actually used the cue
change event to get the

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.250
value of each cue at
the bottom there.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.910
If we actually go to the desktop
device-- hang on, I'll

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.980
just show you what
we're looking at.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.150
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.306
-The web is always changing,
and the way we

00:14:27.306 --> 00:14:29.070
access it is changing.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.350
The source of that
change, is you.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.510
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.780
SAM DUTTON: I'll turn
off the sound.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.090
I think that's all right,
just about.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.830
I can take it up a little
bit bigger actually.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:41.330
So what you can see there is
that in the video element,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.370
I've got this track
element here.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.140
And that points to what's called
a VTT file, which in

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.910
this case is like a
subtitles file.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.230
If we go to that, you could
see it's a very

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.830
straightforward format.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.360
We got these things
called cues.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.720
Each one of these is a cue.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.120
And it has timing and some
kind of hints to help the

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:04.230
thing may be displayed, and then
in this case some text.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.040
Now the cool thing is that
this has just being

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.500
implemented on Chrome
for Android.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.750
So this is really important.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.480
So it's a huge improvement
for accessibility.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.530
And it's also great if you want
to distribute content to

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.470
people who are speaking
different languages but want

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.240
to watch your videos.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:21.810
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.570
So at the moment, the way it
works now, is it overlays

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.500
something on the video.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:25.820
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.270
That's right.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.500
PAUL KINLAN: But it doesn't
actually work on Android

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:27.890
properties.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.510
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, now the other
thing I was going to say

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.800
is there's a bug.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.480
PAUL KINLAN: But you can get
programmatic control what

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.060
you've done there.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.650
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, exactly.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.900
In fact, if we inspect the--
this is kind of interesting

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.760
because if we look at the page
on the desktop machine in the

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.450
DevTools, and--

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.845
I think we can see the--

00:15:48.845 --> 00:15:51.010
let's see if I can--

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.875
PAUL KINLAN: Do we need to
put the elements or the--

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:54.530
SAM DUTTON: I was going
to try and look at

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:55.970
the elements there.

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.220
Thank you, Paul.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.820
He's helping me!

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.190
Yes.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.290
So I just wanted to show you
something while we're there.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.640
So if we look at the video here,
I've turned on just to

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.280
show you in the DevTools you
could see down in the bottom

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.560
there, I've turned
on Shadow DOM.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:16.330
And what that means is that
it's pretty cool.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.670
I can see the stuff for the
actual tracks there.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.205
So that's pretty neat.

00:16:23.205 --> 00:16:26.550
So if I look at the document
fragment there and I burrow

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.670
down here and play a bit.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.140
PAUL KINLAN: So what you do now
is you actually embed--

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.230
like dive in deep into the
actual video elements, and not

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.460
the html representation of it.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.070
SAM DUTTON: That's right.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.250
So if I look in there now, you
can actually see the content

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.900
of that cue there.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.210
PAUL KINLAN: Oh wow.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.060
SAM DUTTON: So that's
pretty neat.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.290
PAUL KINLAN: This is actually
pretty nice.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.430
SAM DUTTON: And then you can
fool around with that stuff.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.570
PAUL KINLAN: So is the track
element supported across

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.580
browsers yet or is
it just Chrome?

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.610
SAM DUTTON: Ah, it's just in
Chrome, but we're hoping for

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.120
better support across
other browsers.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.550
PAUL KINLAN: Are there any
shims available for the

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.240
developers?

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.950
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, there are.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:03.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.349
I think, did one.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:08.329
I'll put some some documentation
about that.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:12.569
Yeah, it's also possible to--
you can get the time of the

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.085
video and then kind of
fake it by putting a

00:17:15.085 --> 00:17:17.530
div across the element.

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.740
But it's not bad.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:20.589
It's not bad.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:24.599
By the way, you can also
access the cue

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.630
itself to style it.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:33.280
If I go to the CSS for this
file, let's add a little--

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:43.770
let's add a little style--

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.780
hang on, while I type.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.100
PAUL KINLAN: Looks
like [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.700
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.750
PAUL KINLAN: Excellent
color red.

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.020
OK, cool.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.850
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, you
should be able to--

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:54.920
hang on, it's not going to show
it on the-- because the--

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.930
if we did it on this one--

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.040
PAUL KINLAN: Can you put one and
say can you bump the fun

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.070
size up on it?

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.690
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, anyway, it
won't show it on the device

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.110
because it's not there.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:07.700
But that's the pseudo-selector
that is colon-colon-cue.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.680
And there will be some other

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.920
pseudo-selectors coming as well.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.700
So you can style cues just as
any other piece of text, which

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.690
is really nice.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.266
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:18:17.266 --> 00:18:17.960
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.150
PAUL KINLAN: So I know that
you did another demo.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.130
Have you go that available
to show?

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.980
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.020
I just wanted to-- while
we're talking about--

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:25.350
PAUL KINLAN: This one?

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.080
I like this demo.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.570
SAM DUTTON: --track.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:27.100
Yeah.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:27.480
Yeah.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.440
So there's couple of things
I've done here.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.570
This is one I really liked.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.090
A guy just going on to
the desktop machine.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.020
This does work on the mobile
device, I have to say.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.570
PAUL KINLAN: It's
not [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:42.884
SAM DUTTON: The video is like
350 gigs, whatever.

00:18:42.884 --> 00:18:44.297
Anyway, it's huge.

00:18:47.692 --> 00:18:54.602
And if we bumped this up,
what this guy did was

00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:55.950
he took video cycle--

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.815
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:57.815 --> 00:19:00.115
SAM DUTTON: This guy took some
video cycling around the

00:19:00.115 --> 00:19:02.450
Google campus of Mountain
View, California.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.270
And he got GPS data
to interact.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:10.140
And what we're seeing is that,
as he goes around, the little

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.088
man moves around the map.

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:13.460
And we're seeing a Street
View synchronized.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.280
Now this is all done via the
cues, so what you can see if

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.300
you look down--

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.650
I'll just drop it down a bit
so that I can see it.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.145
Yeah.

00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:26.620
PAUL KINLAN: I think we're
getting some audio from here.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.105
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:30.085
SAM DUTTON: Oh OK, so
people [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.280
That could be better.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.730
Yes, that's working.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.690
Sorry about the extraneous--

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.090
PAUL KINLAN: Our producer
in the background is--

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.700
SAM DUTTON: Groaning.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.380
PAUL KINLAN: --very pleased.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.130
SAM DUTTON: So this
is really cool.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:49.170
We had like this track
of xml data, turn

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.700
that into Track Cues.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.810
And then we can synchronize the
playback of the video with

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.210
the man moving around
the back.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:00.630
So if we move the man, you
can see the video moves.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.810
And as the video moves,
the man moves.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.650
I really like this
because it was--

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.100
the track element wasn't
designed for this stuff.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.730
I did a similar thing
here-- if we

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.990
just get back to normal--

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.830
I did a little video search
for all the Google Chrome

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.590
videos from developer stuff.

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.640
So, again, what I've done is
I've got all the Google Chrome

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.070
transcripts from DDLs and all
this Google Chrome events.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.570
And there's dozens of them,
190 or something.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.020
And it's searching through all
those and returning these

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:35.680
results for a query.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.550
And then if I click on one of
them, you can see that it goes

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.760
directly to that cue.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.390
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:42.270
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.770
SAM DUTTON: So, a really great
tool for getting into like

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.120
deep navigation and
search in media.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.120
And like I say, this
is now available

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.220
on Chrome for Android.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.090
It's really powerful stuff.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.650
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.300
That's a very nice demo.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.630
I'm trying to work out much
time we got left.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.060
We haven't probably got
a huge amount of time.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.260
So we did have a section
of video and best

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.370
practices with video.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.520
Shall we skip over that and save
that for another episode.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:09.420
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
no, absolutely.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:09.760
Yeah.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.300
Yeah, we can do that.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.650
PAUL KINLAN: Because basically
we want to do a weekly series

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:15.040
for performance, Mobile
Media, and a whole

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.160
lot of other things.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.730
And there's a lot to talk about
around how to actually--

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.270
the best practices for the video
element and actually how

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.300
to deliver video.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.190
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.750
PAUL KINLAN: I think we can save
that for another episode.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.680
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, sure.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.380
PAUL KINLAN: And we'll get on to
the really, really, really

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.340
sexy stuff, if it all works.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:29.800
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.070
PAUL KINLAN: Yes?

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.910
Shall we do that.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.440
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.830
PAUL KINLAN: So--

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.030
SAM DUTTON: Without
further ado.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.080
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.650
PAUL KINLAN: I'll tell you--
it's a better WebRTC demo.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.220
Yeah, so the actual links to all
the demos that we've got

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.120
are going to be on that
documentation that we've got.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.640
So you could actually go
and try these out.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.090
They do work only on Chrome, if
you've enabled the flag for

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.120
the moment.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.590
So I encourage everyone
to go out and test it.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.480
It's not a production-ready
feature just

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.400
yet for mobile phones.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.500
Hopefully soon.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.050
Don't know when though.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:03.900
I think it's the easiest
thing to say.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.100
SAM DUTTON: Yep.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.870
So, yeah, just demoing
on the device now.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:13.380
We've got Data Channel running
just on one page there, which

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.460
is a nice little demo showing
Data Channel's working.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.770
PAUL KINLAN: So what would
you use Data Channel for?

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.520
SAM DUTTON: Ah, so Data Channel
is great for really,

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.410
really low latency transfer
data between peers.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:26.730
The point is you need the
messaging and all that stuff,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.400
as per any connectivity.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.500
You need to be able to connect
between the two devices.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.450
Once that's set up, you're going
as directly as possible

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.670
between them which is neat.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.930
So faster than WebSockets
is the point.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.020
PAUL KINLAN: So that's actually
really interesting,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.190
because two of the projects
I've worked on-- the Super

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.980
Sync Chrome, Super Sync Sports,
and [? Jamware ?]

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.260
Chrome, they've all of this user
interaction piece, where

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.590
basically the user will find
another user in a different

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.345
country and have a race or
they'll make a band and join

00:22:54.345 --> 00:22:55.240
it together.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.680
And you have to have
low latency

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.800
messaging between the peers.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.146
And there can be up to five
peers in each game,

00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:01.770
I think, at a time.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.440
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
that's great.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.360
PAUL KINLAN: Now, they couldn't
use WebRTC because it

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.640
wasn't available at the time.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.260
So they use WebSockets, where
they basically have a central

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.700
server which one client pings
the server and bounces it off

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.790
to the other participants.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.960
Obviously, it's an extra hop of
latency, and you don't know

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.440
where the main servers are and
all this other stuff as well.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.290
So I'm presuming that Data
Channel itself as an API will

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.880
be something that's really
quite powerful.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.820
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.510
And we haven't got
it here today.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.110
But there's been
interoperability demonstrated

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.170
with Firefox, which
is fantastic.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.020
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, for
Data Channel?

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.220
SAM DUTTON: So in other words,
we're talking about full

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:43.330
WebRTC interop between Firefox
Mobile Desktop and Chrome

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.780
Mobile Desktop.

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.860
PAUL KINLAN: It's
pretty powerful.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.720
SAM DUTTON: Really exciting.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.000
There's a bunch of these new
libraries and apps coming

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.330
through, which is just
what we hoped for.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.740
We got stuff like Peer.js,
easyRTC and so on.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.960
And the easyRTC estimate is
something like 3 billion

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.320
WebRTC devices in the next--
about 2016, so huge, huge

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.290
potential there.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:07.840
PAUL KINLAN: That's
going to be cool.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.470
I think it's one of those
fundamental pieces of tech

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.510
that's available to the web that
literally changes the way

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.140
that we communicate
with people.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.670
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, I like the
way one of the WebRTC

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.640
engineers described to me.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.840
He said with RTC Data Channel
you're up against the speed of

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.040
light problem now.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.430
They're really hitting
the wall.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.350
PAUL KINLAN: It seems like
a telecoms problem now.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.530
Does that make sense?

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:30.180
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.100
Exactly.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.240
PAUL KINLAN: I always find the
API like a telecoms API, but

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.640
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.700
like you're getting these APIs
built on top of it now.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.040
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, no, no, we
got these great libraries

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.840
coming through.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.780
If people want to look, check
out the links, and you'll see

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.950
that we've got these libraries
like easyRTC, like full stack

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.000
for the back-end, the front-end,
messaging,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.040
everything in there.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.450
So you don't have to-- yeah,
the API can be--

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.900
it's a lot of work to get your
head around the whole deal

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.940
with messaging, peer
connections, turn service,

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.960
[INAUDIBLE] service and so on.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.250
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.762
So should we do the-- can we
show the demo that we were

00:25:05.762 --> 00:25:05.895
going to show?

00:25:05.895 --> 00:25:06.690
SAM DUTTON: Ohhh,
come on then.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.510
PAUL KINLAN: I know we haven't
got an amazing amount time,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.311
and there's probably not
much point in showing a

00:25:10.311 --> 00:25:11.010
lot of code for this.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.670
But it's a pretty good
one, this one.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.170
SAM DUTTON: OK.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.560
So I wanted to use this app.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.940
I don't even know
the name of it.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.230
I think it's conversatio
or conversat.io.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:24.750
Let's see if I can
it get to work.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:31.670
So I'm going to this site,
converset.io/ok.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.540
This it's all you have
to do to join

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.840
this video chat client.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.110
You're allowed to--

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.995
PAUL KINLAN: I will just say
though to everyone we're not

00:25:37.995 --> 00:25:39.550
actually streaming live.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:39.900
SAM DUTTON: Wow!

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.400
It's done it.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.390
PAUL KINLAN: How cool.

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.990
SAM DUTTON: That's great!

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.580
PAUL KINLAN: This
is really cool.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.695
So I can see your hand moving
in front of the camera.

00:25:45.695 --> 00:25:46.800
SAM DUTTON: I'll try
and get in there.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.661
Hello Paul.

00:25:48.661 --> 00:25:49.560
PAUL KINLAN: I saw
your glasses.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:49.980
How cool.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:50.350
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.100
OK.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.810
PAUL KINLAN: So you can't join
us now because we're actually

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:56.170
cheating a little bit,
and not filming

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.400
exactly live this week.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.650
But if we were live, you
could get people

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.120
joining in quite easily.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.170
Because you look at that URL,
use this extra service.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.090
It's pretty nice.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.140
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
that's right.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.000
PAUL KINLAN: Hello.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.730
SAM DUTTON: Lovely, yeah.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.280
I'm going to kill it off now.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.310
PAUL KINLAN: That was actually
pretty quick.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.800
SAM DUTTON: I know.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.710
PAUL KINLAN: It's pretty cool.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:15.090
SAM DUTTON: It's fantastic.

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:16.465
PAUL KINLAN: Well, did our
producer want to join into

00:26:16.465 --> 00:26:17.715
this conversation?

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:19.970
SAM DUTTON: Slash ok.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.860
PAUL KINLAN: We need to give
him some love at least.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.110
SAM DUTTON: Is he there?

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:25.540
Is he coming through?

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.760
PAUL KINLAN: Aww, he's
got a sad face.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.010
SAM DUTTON: Sad face.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.735
PAUL KINLAN: Forward slash OK?

00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:33.660
No?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.590
He's motioning to us like
he's got something.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:38.440
SAM DUTTON: He's getting
something.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.740
Just while that's happening,
the other thing that we're

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.640
getting with these set
ups like easyRTC is

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.030
access to SIP gateways.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:52.160
What that means is we can get
from the WebRTC, Web World to

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.872
the what's called the--
here he is!

00:26:54.872 --> 00:26:56.560
PAUL KINLAN: Hello.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.204
You can say hello as well.

00:26:58.204 --> 00:27:00.192
PRODUCER: Hello.

00:27:00.192 --> 00:27:01.700
SAM DUTTON: Tragically,
I can't see him here.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.310
You can see him--

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.790
PAUL KINLAN: I can see
him on my desktop.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.940
SAM DUTTON: Can we put that
one under the camera?

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.900
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, we can put
that into the camera, I think.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.320
SAM DUTTON: Come on.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.710
PAUL KINLAN: Just to prove
that it's actually--

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.200
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
it is working.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.490
PAUL KINLAN: Paul, give him
a couple seconds of fame.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.410
I know you can't see very
well but there we are.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:13.820
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.760
The man behind the desk.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.640
PAUL KINLAN: He's actually
gone off from him Nexus--

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.122
Galaxy Nexus S, is it? or
Galaxy Nexus phone?

00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:22.836
I can't remember which
one it is, but--

00:27:22.836 --> 00:27:23.750
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.250
PAUL KINLAN: Wow, I can
hear my voice about

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.750
half a second later.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.610
SAM DUTTON: That
is a bit weird.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.415
I might have to kill
this, I think.

00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:30.510
PAUL KINLAN: I cut off my own.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.540
That's actually pretty
impressive.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:31.820
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.790
It's great.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.180
PAUL KINLAN: That's the type of
thing that can be enabled

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:34.810
by this, right?

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:34.980
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.910
PAUL KINLAN: And once
it's on phones

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.830
and tablets and desktops?

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.400
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.131
PAUL KINLAN: We've got a pretty
ubiquitous kind of

00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:42.540
communication.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.200
SAM DUTTON: This is exactly
what we hoped for, like

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.160
easyRTC has the full stack.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.730
It's ready to go.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.860
it's easy to use and just to
build that into your web apps.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.250
Also Peer.js, I recommend
for Data Channel.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.390
I won't show you the code
now, but it's really

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:57.710
straight-forward.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.340
PAUL KINLAN: We can
go into that.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.830
If people are interested, we can
do another episode around

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:05.240
Peer.js, building mobile apps
which are collaborative,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.980
essentially.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.520
SAM DUTTON: I mean the nice
thing about these places like

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.990
Peer.js is that they're offering
the full back-in

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.460
service to it.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.390
So they're offering turn
service, turn service, and the

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.270
messaging hosting.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.180
All you put in your code is a
couple of lines, give or take,

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.495
and who you want to communicate
with, and that's

00:28:21.495 --> 00:28:21.920
it

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.060
PAUL KINLAN: I really like the
stuff that's happening now,

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.200
because I remember a couple
years ago we did this app

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.855
where you could dial a screen.

00:28:27.855 --> 00:28:29.810
Like you'd ring up a phone
number and then

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:30.800
start talking to screen.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.260
And it was a hack upon a hack.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.650
It was like XMPP
in the back-end

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.510
talking to the screen.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.060
We got like hosted voice XML
solution which would fire off

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.090
the request when you said
North and South.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.720
It was pretty cool for the time,
but it was such a pain.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.390
It was quite slow.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.610
And if you can just dial
straight into a web page, via

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:50.025
a SIP gateway--

00:28:50.025 --> 00:28:50.290
SAM DUTTON: Ohh, I know.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.250
It's good.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.820
PAUL KINLAN: I'm actually quite
kind of excited by this.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.970
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah, that
whole thing, what's called

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.120
PSTN, which is like the normal
telephone network, completely

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.060
now interoperable with WebRTC
apps running on computers.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.600
I mean, cool, fantastic.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.020
PAUL KINLAN: So yes.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.630
Thank you very much.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.740
I think that ends our time.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.680
I think we're run over
our allotted time.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.180
We've actually got a
lot to talk about.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.530
We did this with Jake's show
the other day, where we ran

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.500
quite a lot over.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.120
We've got a lot of content
to tell you guys.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.470
It's not all going to
be Chrome-based.

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.210
It's going to be best practices
for building mobile

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.370
media based applications.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.410
So suppose without much
further of ado--

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:28.950
is that even a phrase?

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:29.330
SAM DUTTON: Further of ado?

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.110
PAUL KINLAN: Futher of ado?

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.920
Without much further
of something.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.170
SAM DUTTON: Sounds good.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:34.580
PAUL KINLAN: I think
we'll end it there.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.060
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.740
SAM DUTTON: I'm Sam Dutton.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.040
And yeah, we'll be bringing
you lots more stuff about

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.510
using the video element on
mobile devices and all that.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.830
PAUL KINLAN: And thank
you to Paul Lewis,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.490
our producer today.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.940
SAM DUTTON: Yes, good man.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.550
PAUL KINLAN: So. thank
you very much, and

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.345
we'll see you soon.

00:29:47.345 --> 00:29:48.430
SAM DUTTON: See you next time.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.680
Bye.
