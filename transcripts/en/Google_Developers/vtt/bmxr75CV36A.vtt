Hi, I'm Raf.
I'm a programmer working on the Google Chrome

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.210
extension system.
I'm here to talk about the design of the APIs

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.519
that you'll use in creating your extension.
One goal in the design of the extensions system

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.260
is that programming extensions should be just
like programming web pages.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.410
So as you'd expect, you'll be programming
in JavaScript which runs inside web pages.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.320
Many things your extension will want to do,
you can accomplish with existing web APIs.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
Want it to talk to a server?
Use XmlHttpRequest.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.670
Want it to persist some data?
Use cookies, LocalStorage, or HTML5 Databases.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.079
Want it to display a nicely designed options
page?

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.859
Use HTML and Cascading Style Sheets.
However, Google Chrome also exposes APIs that

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.149
only extension code can access. We've tried
to make these APIs feel as much like web platform

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.569
APIs as possible.
Let's start with an example:

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.659
This is code from a simple extension which
displays a browser action icon and when the

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.170
user clicks on it, it opens up a web page
which is packaged within the extension.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.760
Already we see a few key aspects of the extension
APIs.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.790
First, you can identify all the extension
calls because they exist in the "chrome" namespace.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.800
"chrome" is a global object to which all extension
APIs are bound.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.360
The Google Chrome extensions APIs are only
visible to extension code and are broken down

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.010
into modules.
Here we are using the "browserAction", "tabs",

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.350
and "extension" modules.
chrome.browserAction.onClicked is an event

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.250
which can register listeners who act on something
interesting that happens -- in this case,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.911
the user clicking the browserAction icon.
Most modules expose events and they all have

00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:44.250
the same form - which allows for the addition
and removal of listeners.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.810
Now, let's look at the call to chrome.extension.getUrl().
This is an example of a synchronous function

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.000
call -- meaning that it does it's thing immediately
and returns a value to the calling code.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.409
In this case, it's constructing a URL which
the browser can use to navigate to a resource

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.250
which is within your extension.
Some API calls are synchronous, but many are

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.180
asynchronous.
Let's take a look at another example:

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.110
Here, we are asking Google Chrome to modify
one of the user’s bookmarks by modifying

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.310
its title.
This call is asynchronous -- meaning that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.019
the code that makes the call will continue
executing and the function you provide as

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.519
a callback will be run sometime later -- and
which point your code will know that the bookmark

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.889
has been updated.
The reason why this call is asynchronous has

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:32.769
to do with Google Chrome's multi-process architecture.
Web pages and JavaScript run in processes

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.620
which are not only separate from each other,
but also from the main browser process which

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.739
alone has the ability to do things like read
 &amp; write to the local file system.

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.609
This is an important security and stability
feature for Google Chrome.

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.499
If calls like this were synchronous, your
extension would have to stop everything and

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.969
wait for the browser process to respond to
the request, all the while the user may be

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.510
trying to interact with the UI of your extension
which has become unresponsive.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.329
Using asynchronous APIs is more challenging,
but it's in the service of the best user experience

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.349
possible, and it won't take long to get the
hang of it.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.319
Just remember that it won't be uncommon to
write code like this

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.410
rather than this
There's one more interesting thing about this

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.469
example:
There's a bug in it that the extensions system

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.870
is going to help us find.
If you look at the documentation for this

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.379
call you can see that the id that chrome.bookmarks.update()
takes as it's first argument is a string,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.739
not an integer. When this call executes, the
extension system will throw an exception pointing

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.180
out the error.
The extensions API uses an implementation

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.959
of JSON schema which declares the name, type,
number and position of its function arguments.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.239
If you call it with the wrong types or wrong
number of arguments, it'll complain.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.400
Additionally, the extension documentation
is generated from exactly the same JSON schema

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.150
that Google Chrome uses to create it's internal
API.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.559
So, for instance, if you are developing using
the beta channel of Google Chrome, you can

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:09.239
be assured that the docs at http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/beta
are accurate.

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.629
In creating the initial release of the extensions
we focused on creating a robust, secure and

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.330
easy to use system that included a small set
of APIs that we felt would allow many useful

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.420
extensions to be made.
It initially includes interacting with browser

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.010
windows, tabs &amp; bookmarks, but we expect to
be adding more soon.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.140
Have fun working with the Google Chrome extensions
and please let us know what we can do to make

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.350
your extensions better by giving us feedback
at our discussion group.
