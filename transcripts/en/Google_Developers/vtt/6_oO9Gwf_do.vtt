[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.235
IDO GREEN: OK.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:15.720
Yeah?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
Can you hear me?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.360
This is not working.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.490
Good afternoon.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.970
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.240
We're really excited
to be here.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.610
It's always a pleasure to be
in a crowd where people are

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.050
passionate about the things that
you are passionate about.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.370
I'm Ido Green, and I'm
Developer Advocate.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.029
DANNY HERMES: I'm
Danny Hermes, a

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:34.390
Developer Programs Engineer.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.930
And I worked on the cloud.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.300
IDO GREEN: Right.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.790
And I'm the client guy
that will speak

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.680
about Chrome and HTML5.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.000
Today we're going to talk about
three quite amazing

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.010
technologies that keep changing
in a rapid pace.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.030
We'll speak about mobile, about
the web, mobile web, and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.300
about the cloud.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.850
And we thought to tell a story
that will take you through the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.960
process that we went, we're
building a mobile web app, and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.260
utilizing Google Cloud Endpoints
as our backend.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.319
So let's first just start with
a nice little demo that just

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.680
will show you a macro
view of what we did.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.330
So you could see this app.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.340
And first and foremost, I'll
just sign in because we do

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.740
want to handle our users and
have the amazing photo that I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.760
will save under my user and
Danny's his, et cetera.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.050
We are here on the normal
network, so please, if

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.550
you are with us--

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.830
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.785
Stop using internet.

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.310
IDO GREEN: Yeah, it would
help us a lot.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.350
So I'm accepting.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.010
I have this--

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.450
when it will finish loading.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.276
DANNY HERMES: It's fine.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:35.220
Just click Accept.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.660
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.450
I did.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.610
DANNY HERMES: Demo gods smile.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.880
IDO GREEN: Yeah,
it's demo gods.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.760
So basically, what we're going
here, it's that regular

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.690
process of what you do
when you sign in

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.220
with Google+ button.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.510
And after we accepting it.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.450
It's need to confirm and send
us the token back, we'll be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.750
able to see the app itself.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.330
And basically what we'll do, it
will fetch all the photos

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.770
that we have stored
in our cloud.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.670
Now, the app itself is built
on top of a few layers.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.460
And what we thought would be
wise is just to show you some

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.240
of the best practices that we
encapsulate and baked into the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.270
app itself.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.010
So the app itself will work
when finally we'll end

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.660
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.710
It will work offline
completely.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
So like any native app that you
are accustomed to, this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.660
app need just the beginning to
do this, call to the server,

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.490
get all the assets, get the
skeleton, and let you work

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.760
with the app even when you don't
have connection, or when

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.530
you have flaky connections.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.420
So one of the most important
features that we are able to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.500
achieve here is that
the performance

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.620
will be much better.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.220
We'll have 60 frames
per second.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.160
The app will be really
responsive.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.540
Everything will work fast.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.110
And the user, of course,
satisfaction will be higher.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.150
So apparently our network
here is not allowing

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.620
us to do too much.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.780
So basically, I'll try--
maybe we'll--

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.595
DANNY HERMES: Let's do
it from the desktop.

00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:04.056
Let's just pretend like we're
on mobile, sadly.

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:04.510
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.040
So this is our app.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.070
And you have your status button
that just will confirm

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.550
to us when we are offline and
online, so you'll be able to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.770
see it with us.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.140
And I already signed in, so I
could do it pretty quick again

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.680
just to see that all the
process is working.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.410
So I'm accepting.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.580
The sign in button
has vanished.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.160
And now I'm in the app.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.480
I have here my photos.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.560
And of course I can attach
and create new photo.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.700
So one of the beautiful things
here is that when I'm taking a

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.520
new photo, here it will just
open the file chooser and will

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.000
fetch the photo, as you saw.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.590
But on the mobile device, it
will actually go to the camera

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.690
itself and allow me to
capture and speak

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.000
with the camera directly.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.310
And we see that we have lots of
device APIs through there

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.770
that are baked into the web
platform and allow you to do

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.610
quite amazing stuff when being
closer to the metal.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.920
So here I have this photo.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.666
I'll give it a title, a
description, and I'll save it.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.800
One of the things that you saw,
it immediately saved it.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.660
And then we got another
confirmation that it send it

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.610
into the cloud.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.810
So basically, we are able here--
and here it was quite

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.520
fast, but if this was working,
you could see that

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.540
we have some lags.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.960
But the beauty of it is that
we are confirming to the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.850
client that the action
was done.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.339
Our user doesn't really need to
be worry about it, and it

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.930
works much faster.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.540
Now, the photo is here.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.960
I'll pull out the
network cable.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.970
And as you saw, it's
becoming offline.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.080
And I could do the same
operation again.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.380
So I'm going, I'm
adding a photo.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:46.100
Let's add a new one, give
it a name, and save it.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.950
Now we're getting confirmation
just that it saved locally.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.550
And since we don't have any
connection with the cloud,

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.380
we'll save it.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.780
We'll put it in a queue, and
later on when we do have

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.910
connection, and let's just
hook it up and see what

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.270
happened, it will know how to
sync it with the cloud and

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.950
actually enable us to see it
from different devices.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.270
So if it was working, we could
have seen it here and here on

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.180
different screens.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.460
And actually, you can see that
we're doing the best with the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.650
real estate that the screen
itself is letting us.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.720
So we passed the demo.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.970
Maybe we'll move on.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.810
Yeah.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.770
So cloud and client.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.370
So let's just have a little
role game here.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.350
I'm the client guy, as
you mentioned, so my

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.800
answer would be no.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.040
We don't need any server.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.440
We just need it once to get all
the assets, and then we

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.650
are happy campers.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.240
But before we do that, let's
just define to ourselves what

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.780
we see in a modern
web application.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.690
And it could be web, it
could be mobile, it

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.070
could be both of them.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.020
One of the things that we saw,
that all of them got one goal,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.200
and they're trying to get the
user to achieve their goal

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.910
with the highest efficiency
as possible.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.290
So they are very focused,
very contained.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.710
We see more and more code that
is flowing to the client side,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.130
and that's why we see it
flourishing in all the MV*

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.880
frameworks.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.310
Basically, we're talking about
clear separation between our

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.930
data and our views.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.310
We just want to be able to
maintain our apps, especially

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.760
when they're growing
quite fast.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.470
Offline first, so like Eric
Schmidt coined the term mobile

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.330
first, we'll now try to term
and work with offline first

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.940
methodology.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.270
So the app will work everywhere
in any case.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.350
And it's true that we're in a
web browser and we are online

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.760
most of the time, but even in
cases where we are on a

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.620
submarine or airplane or flaky
connection, we'll still be

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.870
able to do the most--

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.470
with our app, like you saw, the
most crucial functionality

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.740
to take a photo is back there.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.100
Device aware, you know that we
have now browsers as an open

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.080
technology on handheld devices,
tablets, laptops,

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.430
desktops, and TVs.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.630
So screen size of 2 inch up to,
I don't know, 100 inch,

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.580
and you should do the best with
the real estate that the

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.380
device itself lets you.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.620
Pref matters, it's a hashtag
that we're using through all

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.350
Chrome channels.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.660
And we just want to emphasize
the importance of making the

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.260
app work best.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.540
We all know that users love the
app to be responsive and

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.650
snappy, and everything should
work as fast as possible.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.710
So cloud and server.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.680
So if I'm playing the role-- and
please take my things with

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.060
a grain of salt here--

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.520
I could say hey, we have quite
a lot of amazing HTML5 APIs

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.060
that allow us to save the
skeleton of the app in the

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.790
AppCache to use local storage
or File API or IndexedDB or

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.810
any methodology that will let us
save state and data on the

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.660
client side.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.920
So basically, we are
quite happy just

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.550
to be on the client.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.300
We want to minimize
the interactions.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.580
Why?

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.450
Because network is quite slow,
specifically on some networks,

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.590
like we have here, a
perfect example.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.470
And we want this one connection
and that's it, so

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.030
really to do the most
from any and each

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.110
connection that we're making.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.330
The way to do it is just to
pretend that there is no

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.310
connection, and then to
build a sync layer.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.830
Because as you saw, to save
things locally, to save things

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.960
offline, quite easy.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.750
The logic or the magic is in the
sync layer that does the

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.280
right things in the
right moment.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.540
And the code here is just this
really simple API to know

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.160
where we are offline or
when we are online.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.340
DANNY HERMES: So when asked the
question to me, are the

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.490
cloud and the client friends,
well, of course they are.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.020
Maybe the tablet and
the network in

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.420
this room aren't friends.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.340
But the cloud and the client
are definitely friends.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.930
So I'm a resounding
yes on this one.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.230
So when you're building a modern
application, you're

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.330
obviously thinking about your
client first, whether it's the

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.640
mobile web or a native
application.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.640
But they have to rely
on the cloud.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.970
Users are used to holding a
phone, which they treat as a

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.880
data center.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.210
They send off queries to very
large organizations that are

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.419
doing very intense things across
the network, and they

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.370
actually expect this from
your applications.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.930
So being able to offload
computation is

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.190
actually a big deal.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.300
When you have lots of users,
you want a single source of

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.050
truth for data.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.230
You want to be able to store
it somewhere other than the

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.540
client, right?

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.690
And of course, as we saw here,
we have the tablet, which

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.770
won't work, and the desktop,
which is connected to ethernet

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:04.710
and just fine.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.590
So you have some users signing
in from more than one place.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.510
So you actually need the cloud,
a server, to have this

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.000
one source of truth.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.440
So he's saying we have to
minimize interactions.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.050
We have to be offline.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.890
Well, that's actually
a good thing.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.450
It's not abandoning the cloud.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.080
It's informing the way
that we actually

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.650
think about the cloud.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.830
So does anyone remember DRY,
Don't Repeat Yourself?

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.150
We hear this all the time.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.790
When we're writing code,
obviously don't write the same

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:32.670
thing twice, right?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.350
Functions, classes, whatever.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.610
But when we're talking about
the network, it's just as

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.460
important not to repeat
yourself.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.610
Because in this situation, where
you don't have lots of

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.530
network, you can actually rely
on things that you already

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.520
know, rely on the conversations
that you've

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.810
already had, and use these nice
HTML5 technologies to

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.970
actually keep this
data around.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.310
So we have to actually get the
most out of each and every

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.230
interaction and lick the bowl
clean like a good boy or girl.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.690
So now I want to talk a bit
about the tools we use to

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.430
build this application.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.960
I'd love to demo it
at some point.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.490
So we actually use a good chunk
of the Google Cloud

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.730
Platform, which is
what I work on.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.640
And I just want to talk about
some tools that we use to help

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.440
our friends.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.670
So if it wasn't already
clear, the cloud

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.040
the client are friends.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.500
So we do need a server.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.560
But who wants to run a server?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.080
It's hard, right?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.030
Let's go shopping.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.010
No.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.760
So running a server is hard, and
we want to make it easy.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.330
So some of the things that are
solved problems that are hard

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:38.640
but not worth solving are things
like traffic spikes,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.370
communicating with your client
and your server, actually

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.900
doing authentication, trying
to figure out how to make

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.100
payloads efficient.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.570
Like I said, these are all
solved problems, and these are

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.480
things you shouldn't be thinking
about when building

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.470
an application.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.820
So we want to be the easy button
in as many places as we

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.750
can, and we want to push
this down extra hard.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.060
So the biggest technology
that we run on

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.550
is Google App Engine.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.490
Google App Engine, for those who
don't know, is a platform

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.070
as a service, which allows you
to write code in your language

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:07.900
of choice--

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.760
here Java, Go, Python,
and as [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.160
earlier today, PHP as well.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.890
But you actually get to use
Google's infrastructure to

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.630
scale up and scale down
based on your traffic.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.140
And in addition, you also get to
use App Engine's NoSQL data

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.010
store to store and interact with
data the same way Google

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.800
services do.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.400
On top of Google App Engine,
we're using Google Cloud

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.900
Endpoints, which essentially
allows you to write an API

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.430
that looks like a Google API.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.530
More about this later.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.500
What does that mean,
a Google API?

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.970
So all modern Google
APIs have something

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.590
called a discovery document.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.430
And it's a giant bit of JSON.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.900
You don't have to actually
see what's on this slide.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.420
But what this discovery document
does, it fully

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.670
specifies everything
the API can do.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.100
So it's a language to actually
describe what payloads should

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.460
look like, what methods are
available, what kind of auth

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.000
is needed, you name it.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.880
It describes how the
API behaves.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.000
OK, Danny.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.830
So what?

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.650
I don't care.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.730
It's JSON.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:08.370
Cool.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.640
Well, so what?

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.550
By having a single document to
describe all APIs, we have

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.870
client libraries in lots and
lots of different languages

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.290
that actually understand
discovery no matter

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.340
which API it is.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.490
And so if we bring a new API
online, these libraries out of

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.230
the box work with that API.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.940
OK, sweet.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.430
So with Google Cloud Endpoints,
you can write your

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:36.590
own API that looks like a Google
API, and this giant

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.980
tool chain is already
at your disposal.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.500
So now you can think about
features instead of thinking

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.540
about how in the world
am I going to send my

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.170
data back and forth.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.760
And the last piece of the puzzle
that we use, it's a

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.800
library that I wrote, so it's
definitely my favorite piece.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.610
It's called
endpoints-proto-datastore.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.580
And this is a way for us, on the
Python runtime of Google

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.370
App Engine, to have a way for
our data and our interface to

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.020
be the same.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.730
So I have this simple class up
here, bank account, which says

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.730
OK, we've got an owner, which
is a string, and a balance,

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.780
which is a flow property.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.660
So in my bank account, I have
leet dollars, right?

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.930
But my data through the client
looks exactly like the

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.060
structure that I'm defining
on the server.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.450
And this again, data is the most
important thing in our

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.160
application.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.700
I keep saying API, API, API.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.690
Well, that I in API stands
for interface.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.160
And when we're writing
applications, we care about

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.300
getting data to the server
and just moving

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.570
away from that step.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.780
All we really want to do is
send what we know and just

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.800
move on from there.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.160
And so by using this
library, we're

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.650
actually able to do that.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:47.690
So enough about the
tools we did use.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.030
Let's talk about how
we use them.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.890
IDO GREEN: So we take
it from the client.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:57.130
And as you saw before, and
actually now it's all here,

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.260
because some time passed, so
we have it locally here as

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.130
well, but here the most
important aspect is when we

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.750
open dev tools, we could see
literally that we have all the

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.130
metadata under local storage.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.710
So the metadata on each and
every photo is there.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:12.020
And then we use the application
File API to save

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.380
the photos themselves.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.670
When speaking about the
application itself, so we

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.980
touched upon it, but we want
the skeleton of the app

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.360
already in our disposal.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.200
So one interaction, and we're
getting the HTML, JavaScript,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.370
CSS of our app.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.924
We could download some assets,
like some images and mp3 files

00:14:29.924 --> 00:14:31.210
if you want.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.020
And once we do that, the
app is full functional.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.120
And from that moment, basically
we're using the sync

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.890
layer to speak with the server
when we want this one source

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.200
of truth to broadcast all the
information to all the

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.300
different devices that we
consume and use this

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.160
application.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.620
Photos, we love photos, and
that's why we shift our app

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.475
around them.

00:14:50.475 --> 00:14:54.720
For photos, we have quite a lot
of abilities to save them.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.540
In our case, we use files.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.300
So like any other platform,
you could really use files

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.510
under the browser.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:05.260
And in our case, HTML5 File
API is really nice to work

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.810
with filer.js, that Eric
Bidelman wrote, and its open

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.800
source in GitHub.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.665
And basically, it lets you open
files like you're working

00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:12.480
with files in Linux.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.430
One of the things that we did
here that's another tip is

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.820
that we choose the right
tool to the job.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.430
So when we want to save
metadata, local storage is

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.780
perfect key value.

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.410
API, when we want to store the
images, we want to store

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.220
binary data.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.080
So it would be much more
efficient to render

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.740
the DOM with them.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.080
And we don't need these basics
for in and out each time.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.360
That's why we choose the File
API with the local storage to

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.840
do the best in both worlds.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.730
When we're going and speaking
about the world out there,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.490
it's usually not white
and black.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.400
It's usually the golden
path between them.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.510
And it's a complex world.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.390
We have a wide range
of devices with

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.000
browsers, with versions.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.380
And we want to support as
much many of course.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.920
In our case, one of the things
that we choose is this

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.900
obstruction layer.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.850
In our case, it's launcher.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.000
But there are plenty of other
libraries that are out there

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.830
that basically mask the
lower level APIs that

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:05.670
you're going to use.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.990
And it will do the best things
with the capabilities that

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.990
your users' browsers
are letting you do.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.540
So if there is quite an old
browser, and it just supports,

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.580
let's say, local storage,
it will do

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.590
that, or website storage.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.260
If it has NoSQL, the
new IndexedDB

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.450
there, it will use it.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:23.880
If you need WebSQL on another
platform, it will let you do

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.780
that as well.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.040
And it's really nice, because in
your data layer, you could

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.830
just commit the save method.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.270
And under the seam, it will do
the right things with it.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.630
DANNY HERMES: So we actually
can do this demo because it

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.860
doesn't require the network.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:38.440
IDO GREEN: Right.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.380
So let's switch.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.000
DANNY HERMES: So this is
the mobile device.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.190
IDO GREEN: And you can see now
that we've got all the photos

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.700
from before, and even
the one that I took

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.620
on the machine itself.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.870
DANNY HERMES: Let me--

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.430
there we go.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.970
And I have here the Chrome
Inspector open for this

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:02.800
application.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.950
And we can actually see
all these assets.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:09.740
So if we blow them away,
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, and

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:15.810
go back to the application,
force a reload, we still have

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.290
the application, but none
of the data is there.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:20.550
And we really don't
have a connection

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.609
to make this happen.

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.640
So it's really completely
happening locally.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.359
So it's a wonderful
thing that we

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:30.260
actually get to demo something.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.090
IDO GREEN: Lucky us.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.100
DANNY HERMES: So that was
how it works offline.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.370
And I promise, though that
button was green, that really

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.870
was offline.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.730
But let's talk about online, how
we're actually talking to

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:47.000
our server when we are talking
to our server, as infrequently

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.380
as that may be.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:54.150
So first, that red button, which
would have worked great,

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.930
is very simple to add if you
want to add authorization to

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.700
your application.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:02.340
It's really a tiny bit of HTML,
just a button with a

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:08.780
sign in call back to actually
respond from the response of

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.450
whether or not sign in was
successful or not.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.850
So this is another thing which
we don't have to do.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.740
Easy button.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.420
So how about discovery?

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.020
How is discovery helping us with
actually calling our API?

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.160
So in this first code snippet
up above, we see gapi dot

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.290
client dot load, and
then there's an API

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.820
name and an API version.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.920
And this is how we're actually
loading the client library for

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.430
a specific API, in this case,
the URL Shortener API.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.380
And once we've done that, the
gapi dot client object now has

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.680
a URL shortener object, which it
owns, which knows how to do

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.090
everything in calling
that API, which is

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.620
specified in discovery.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.750
And through the library, we
just pass in our payload.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.080
And from there, we get an object
which has an execute

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.150
method, and that execute method
will take a call back,

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.810
and that callback handles
the response.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.180
Very simple, and it's based
on the discovery

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.740
document for that API.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.740
So with Google Cloud Endpoints,
this is already at

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.580
our disposal.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.970
So in the same fashion, we
specify our API name and

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.330
version to gapi dot client dot
load, but we also need to

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:19.670
specify an API route because
we can't host our APIs on

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.920
googleapis.com if we're
not Google, right?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.200
And then to actually call the
API, it's the exact same

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.520
thing, gapi dot client,
API name, the

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.880
resource, then the method.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.680
And you got it.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.720
It's the exact same thing.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.320
So I got this.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.900
So what happened to minimizing
interactions?

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.670
So there was actually a bad
thing in there, which goes

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.810
against these things we
were saying before.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.770
Gapi dot client dot load
actually uses a network call

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.010
every time we want to
talk to a new API.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:58.620
So if we are in these conditions
where we don't have

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.240
a great network connection,
wasting one request could make

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.790
a difference between actually
retrieving a photo and making

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.490
a user's experience
better or not.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.130
So to get the most out of it, we
have to tweak this a little

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:14.070
bit and get our hands dirty,
but not too dirty.

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.430
So if you were to pop open the
Chrome dev tools and check out

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.570
the network for a typical
request, you would see a giant

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.480
waterfall with a bunch of
RPCs down the left.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.070
And one of those RPCs really
isn't too complex.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.190
It's a standard path based on
where your application lives.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.970
And then the actual payload
takes a method name, so here

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.640
picturesque photo list when we
want to list photos, and then

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.320
the actual payload as params.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.100
So constructing one of these,
not so difficult.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.900
But we wanted to make things
easier, right?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.890
So never fear.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.290
GAPI actually provides us a way
to do this without wasting

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.810
that network request on
GAPI client load.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.420
So we can actually create the
RPC request by hand using

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.470
gapi.client and call it in the
exact same fashion by passing

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:04.740
a call back to execute.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.790
So it's OK.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.410
We can still use it.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.150
And this is how we're
calling offline.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.430
So now that we know how to call
offline, let's actually

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.050
see how we're doing this, not
in the abstract, but in the

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.605
applied sense in our
application.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.980
IDO GREEN: So we all know, and
we spoke about the separation

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.110
between our data and the views,
and here when we are

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.240
taking a photo, one of the most
important aspect is that

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.870
today, modern browsers, you
put in this one line, and

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.690
basically you're getting the
ability to go to the camera

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.800
itself, and in some cases, to
the file system that you have

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.740
on the device, and to
choose the camera.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.320
So you don't need any other apps
or any other libraries in

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:46.950
order to support this close
nature to the methods of the

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.090
device itself.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.850
When we come in to do it in our
own application, what we

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.180
have here in store is
our own data layer.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.700
And we have the callbacks just
to make sure that we'll be

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.450
able to respond to the things
that we make in the

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.780
configuration of it.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.320
But then the beauty is that
we have the save click.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.410
And basically, we just need
to focus on that.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.950
Our add photo method is asking
us what we'll do beneath it in

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:10.750
the sync layer.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.240
So for us now as developers that
are using this library,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.370
we just want to save
the photo.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.630
We don't care about if
it's locally, if it's

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.760
in the cloud, whatever.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.370
We just know that it
would be saved.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:22.440
And then the codec will return
and let us know what

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.170
happened with it.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:26.120
So we'll communicate it
to the view itself.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.080
DANNY HERMES: So on the server,
when that add photo

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.980
request comes through, in the
same way we defined a bank

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.170
account using
endpoints-proto-datastore, we

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.750
define a photo with the same
data that we expect to send in

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.550
our interface.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.970
And with that, there's
a nice bit of sugar.

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:45.530
There's a decorator provided,
photo dot method, which allows

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.440
us to decorate a method, which
will expect to actually

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.540
receive a native photo
object based on the

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.010
data from the request.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.900
So here, we could do some things
to validate the request

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.100
after it comes in, but
essentially, all we really

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.020
want to do is store it.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.130
So we call photo dot put to save
that in the App Engine

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.380
data store.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.650
IDO GREEN: And in the client,
when we basically use this

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.430
separation between our data and
our views, what we did is

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.480
just listening to the online
navigator, and you could see

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.150
quite nicely here what's
happening.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.740
So let's see this piece of code
and walk you through it.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.490
Basically, we have the task
object that know how to handle

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.060
our calls to the API itself, and
we have some payloads and

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.490
some metadata on our photos.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.440
And when we go in and we want
to active a new task,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.010
basically we see if our
user is logged in,

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.710
and here we'll know.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.700
In case it doesn't login because
we had some problems

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.550
like in our demo, we go to this
special queue and just

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.540
put it, and we'll wait until it
would be authenticated and

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.380
log into our app.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.050
In the case that it is logged
in, we just need to check with

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.190
navigator online if we are
online or offline, and that in

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.070
case we are online, we just want
to call the task itself

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.670
and do the best in terms of
going local storage or moving

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.590
it to the cloud.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.040
And if it's not online for some
reason, or we got some

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.730
flaky connections, we just add
it to this queue of offline

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.710
tasks that we'll run over and
over to make sure when we have

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.080
connection, to just take
those tasks and

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.430
send them to the server.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.890
The beauty here is that we
always take the photo and

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.170
immediately save it locally,
but then when we have

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.725
connection, we'll sync it
to the server itself.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:25.170
DANNY HERMES: All right.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.570
So sorry about that.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.410
We're actually going to
try to demo something.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.510
They've got some hardware which
will let us get ethernet

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.920
into that tablet.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.350
So after we create a photo,
there's really only one other

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.810
thing we want to do for this
application, which is getting

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.730
photos potentially from other
devices that we have saved for

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.450
our account.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.080
So we're actually going to--

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.330
this is the point where the
server doing the expensive

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.410
things comes into place.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.100
But in doing those expensive
things, we have to keep

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.580
something in mind.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.500
Minimize interactions, if
it wasn't clear already.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.480
So what are some things
that we're doing?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:03.110
We're loading photos in the
order that the server learned

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.200
about them.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.080
And so by doing this, we
actually have a time stamp,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.160
which is sort of the latest
date that our client knows

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.930
that it talked to the server.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.830
And of course, in the same way
we implemented the sync layer

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:20.760
with create, when it's time to
actually talk to the API, if

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.320
we're not online, we're not
signed in, we defer it into

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.460
some kind of task.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.110
Back to the slides, please.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:29.360
Yeah.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.730
So on the client--

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.250
IDO GREEN: On the client,
what we do here is

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:36.760
basically quite simple.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.180
We're getting the local photos
first and getting

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.400
a remote call back.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.840
And now that we got all the
local photos first, we're

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.720
getting some metadata with
them, and one of the most

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.700
important aspect is
the last update.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.250
So we'll call the server with
this attribute and making sure

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.690
that we're just getting the
data of the photos that we

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.690
don't have locally.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.130
And that will, of course,
improve the performance, and

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.410
basically will reduce the time
and the time around it we are

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.300
spending just to get
all the data back.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.320
As you can see, in the client,
it's quite simple.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.160
The not problematic but
challenging aspect is on the

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:07.690
server side.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.920
So let's see how we're
doing there.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:09.260
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.420
So on the server, we're trying
to make our queries more

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.220
intelligent and make our server
work harder so that our

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.790
clients don't have to.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.390
So what we're actually going
to be doing is creating an

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.420
index for sort of more
complex interactions.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.760
So by default, the App Engine
NoSQL Datastore will create an

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.920
index for every property
that you have, unless

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.170
you tell it not to.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.890
So if you want to know every
photo that I own with title of

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.420
fu, it can do it for
you out of the box.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.950
But if you wanted something more
complex, like a composite

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:43.030
of some properties, like here we
see owner and updated, you

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:47.380
would have to specify that
in index.yaml file.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.240
It's just a specification when
you deploy your application.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.990
So this actually makes it
a little more expensive.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.230
Every time we have to write our
entity to the data store

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.580
when we're saving the data
that we received from our

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.960
clients, we also have to create
a log and an index to

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.930
actually reference later when
we're doing these queries.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.130
But the advantage is when our
client makes the request, it's

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.780
way faster.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.320
So to actually provide this
through our interface, the

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.000
library
endpoints-proto-datastore

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.010
actually provides us with
some extra sugar.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:24.000
Other than properties to be
persisted, we also have a

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.080
property called endpoints alias
property, as you see

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.160
here, which allows us to have
fields which are only a part

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.860
of the interface and never
get stored anywhere.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.700
And so for us to actually let
the client ask us, hey, I know

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.930
about everything up until
20 minutes ago.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.910
Can you give me everything
since 20 minutes ago?

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.520
We have to give them a way to
send 20 minutes ago, right?

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.910
So we have an endpoints
alias property.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.020
And the real work here is
happening in a setter.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.140
So in that setter,
there's really

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.020
three things that happen.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.960
So the first thing, we take the
value from the request.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.480
We try to turn it from a string
to a native Python

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.090
daytime object.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.740
If we can't do it, we raise
what's called an endpoints dot

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.180
bad request exception.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.380
And for those familiar with HTTP
status codes, that tells

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.050
the client, hey, here's a 400.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.470
You sent me bad data.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.490
Send me good data or
don't talk to me.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:20.520
And of course, if we did get
good data, then we take the

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.560
query associated with the
request, and we are able to

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:28.300
add a filter, which here says
photo dot updated greater than

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.540
or equal to last updated.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.160
So what this does, it takes our
data and says we only want

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.390
the things which have been
updated since, for example, 20

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.140
minutes ago, whatever
time stamp came

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.010
in through the request.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:45.120
And finally, when we're actually
serving this request,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.480
in the same way we got a photo
dot method decorator, we have

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.870
a photo dot query decorator,
which allows us to interact

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.380
directly with a data store
query, instead of directly

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.640
with the data, the photo
from the request.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.240
And so we want to order that
query by when it was updated.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.300
And by doing this, if a user has
to actually page through a

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.960
results set, they will
get them in the order

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.130
from oldest to newest.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.110
And so, for example, if you
drop your connection while

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.140
you're paging through a results
set, you'll actually

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.310
be able to say, well, it used
to be that I knew about

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.270
everything up until
20 minutes ago.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.080
Now I know about everything
until 10 minutes ago, and so I

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.690
don't have to waste that query
for the time in between.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.750
So that was everything that we
would have showed in the demo,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.820
some other things that we would
have like to have done,

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.990
and which we will be adding to
the open source code for this

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.950
application.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.500
One would be sharing.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.790
So we actually did implement
this before, and we were able

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.730
to create an access control
list, or an apple, for every

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.670
photo, and allow users with
Google+ share intents to

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.200
actually have a native Google+
share button and share their

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.040
photos with other users.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.040
And it would again be based
on auth and fairly easy.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.910
In addition, we were downscoping
the photos,

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.080
shrinking them so they would fit
in the Google App Engine

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.830
data store.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:14.290
There are many pieces of the
Google Cloud Platform that

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.340
address storage.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.240
And so Google Cloud Storage,
or the Google App Engine

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.560
Blobstore, are probably a better
place for large and

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.390
high quality photos, rather than
the data store, which in

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.230
the same way that local storage
was a good place to

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.640
actually store metadata, while
the local file system was a

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.700
good place to store photos, we
have the data store as a good

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:43.110
place for metadata and a nice
bucket type system like cloud

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.980
storage, which is a good
place for photos.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:48.780
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:51.170
Take a deep breath.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.440
So we tried to tell you a story
and communicate some

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.690
important aspect that
we found compelling.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.470
One is that Google App Engine
and specifically Google Cloud

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.830
Endpoint is powerful service
that you might want to check

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.660
out in your next API service
product that you're building.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.230
Or we think about performance
and try to minimize the

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.750
connections and optimize each
and every connection that

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.920
you're doing to the server.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.890
Use obstructions layer and do
clear separation between your

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.850
data and the views.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.860
It will be much more
maintainable code.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.950
And as you all know, you're
reading code much more than

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.980
you're writing it, so you do
want the shortest possible

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.510
clear code in your app.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.950
Leverage modern browser
features.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:31.140
So we have actually on
the mobile browsers

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.290
quite a lot of features.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:35.630
And a site like caniuse.com
could reveal to you all the

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.910
new APIs that mobile browser
are supporting, and we have

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.720
great adoption in that field.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.520
So just use them.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.300
We have some really nice talks
today, tomorrow, and on Friday

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.660
that are addressing it, and
we highly encourage you

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.690
to check them out.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.410
There are a few options here.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.110
Danny chose his favorite.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.150
I chose mine.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.040
But feel free to
check them out.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.830
Some compelling stories about
how to do interesting things

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:02.380
in the cloud and on
the mobile web.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.540
Thank you very much
for your time.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.750
We do have seven minutes, and
would be more than happy to

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:10.739
try and answer your questions.

00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:13.493
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:13.493 --> 00:32:15.100
DANNY HERMES: In theory,
we could do the demo.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.490
IDO GREEN: If you have
any questions, just

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:20.740
please come to the mic.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:24.950
IDO GREEN: Hi.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:25.950
DANNY HERMES: Howdy.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.570
AUDIENCE: I've been using Cloud
Endpoints for some time,

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.740
and it's really, really cool.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.660
One of the things that is
probably out of the scope of

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:36.330
this conference,
access control.

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.475
I mean, it's kind of a huge
beast to handle sometimes, so

00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:43.210
I would love to see
elegant ways of

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.530
handling access control.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.400
DANNY HERMES: Sure, sure.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.840
I don't know that there's
a question there.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.960
But I will address sort of
the general concept.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.415
So with access controls,
we're essentially--

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.270
every user, especially when
you're doing Google+ sign in,

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:03.950
you get access to their Google+
ID via the scopes that

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:04.710
they allow.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.370
And so there's sort of a
global ID for accounts.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:12.500
And so what we're using, we're
allowing the data store to

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.360
actually have just a list of
account IDs associated with

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.310
every photo.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.370
And then, in addition to that,
to make queries for somebody

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.870
else's stuff that I was
allowed to see.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.896
We would also, on our user
objects, where we were storing

00:33:26.896 --> 00:33:30.650
our created user accounts, we
would keep a list of all the

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.390
other users that had shared
stuff with them.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:38.850
And so by doing so, as sort of
a first order implementation,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:44.270
we were able to actually to
utilize the data store and

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.890
queries from App Engine to
make it appear fast.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.480
But as far as something native,
there's not anything

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.730
that I know of.

00:33:57.786 --> 00:33:59.262
This mic's not on.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.340
AUDIENCE: Operate on the Google+
sign in plus endpoints

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.010
integration.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:15.179
Because for plus log in, you
need to request a difference

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:17.730
code than for endpoints,
right?

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:21.620
The user emails code versus
that plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.060
DANNY HERMES: So the question
was he wanted us to elaborate

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.480
on how you can use endpoints
and G+ sign

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.230
in at the same time.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:40.000
So what actually happens with
endpoints for typical OAuth is

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.130
you need the email scope and
sort of nothing else.

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:47.500
And G+ sign in requires the
user info profile scope.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.060
But you can actually
combine the two.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:54.340
So you have a token which has
both scopes on it, and either

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.180
ID tokens or bearer tokens can
be used with endpoints.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.750
And so if you actually send a
bearer token, it will still

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.900
check out that it has
the email scope.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:08.120
It's only in the ID token case
where that will fail since you

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.140
don't just have the
email scope.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.720
IDO GREEN: Yes, please.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.930
AUDIENCE: On the client side,
in this example, it looked

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:19.870
like all the data was
kind of dynamic.

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.550
I was wondering if you have any
guidance around what would

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.520
traditionally be the static
part of the pages that are

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.330
filled in with the dynamic data
with the idea that I want

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.900
to cache this and have it
available somewhat offline.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.396
IDO GREEN: Yeah, so actually
we couldn't show it, but in

00:35:36.396 --> 00:35:39.650
our demo, we had the structure
of the app itself, which

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:40.450
wasn't dynamic at all.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.750
So we have all the
assets with us.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.770
All the nice button and the
footer and the header are

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:48.970
actually being fetched
in the first call.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.150
And from that on, once we have
the skeleton of the app, it

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.260
could be a background image,
it could be some

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.830
music file if you like.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.770
Once we have all that, then
we're fetching everything

00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:58.720
dynamically.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.090
And it's actually a phenomenon
that we see in lots of

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:05.200
different apps, native end
mobile webs, where you have

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.950
the skeleton, and then the
data itself is being

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:08.010
retrieving.

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:10.120
All the apps containing some
long list of things.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.150
It could be a mail.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.540
It could be a social app.

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.540
It could be a photo app.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.040
It's usually the skeleton just
like we did, and then all the

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.780
photos there.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.420
I didn't mention it, but the
app itself is live at that

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.180
URL, and you're more than happy
to check it when you

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.130
have connection and see
that it works for you.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.580
Yes, please.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:30.870
AUDIENCE: Cool, I maybe have
two questions for you guys.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.800
Is endpoints still considered
experimental?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.230
DANNY HERMES: It's considered
preview.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.700
The language around that
and cloud platform

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.340
has recently changed.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.953
We have a product manager here
who could probably talk your

00:36:43.953 --> 00:36:46.130
ear off about it, but I
know a fair amount.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.570
So preview essentially is our
way of saying it's not

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:53.460
completely general availability
yet, which is our

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.190
generic term for like no labels
at all other than just

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.650
use it, right?

00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:59.490
But we're committed to it, we're
committed to improving

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.890
it, and we're actively working
on it very quickly.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.970
AUDIENCE: So that's my
second question.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.360
I'm the developer at
the Ferris web

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.900
framework for App Engine.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.500
And I'm planning on integrating
Cloud and

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.870
Endpoints with that
so that Ferris--

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.090
DANNY HERMES: Sorry, what
framework did you say?

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.220
AUDIENCE: Ferris.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.120
Ferris by--

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.610
DANNY HERMES: Ferris,
like Ferris wheel?

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:16.860
AUDIENCE: Like Ferris Bueller.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.320
DANNY HERMES: OK,
that works too.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
to be lazy.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.530
It's kind of similar to Flask
and Django in a way,

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.440
specifically for App Engine.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.650
So we're planning on integrating
Cloud Endpoints

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:30.750
into Ferris so you can share the
same code between the two.

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.560
So the big question there is,
how much more is the API going

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.070
to change from this point.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.470
DANNY HERMES: Yeah, I can't
answer a question like that.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.230
AUDIENCE: You can't answer
a question like that.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:41.000
OK, cool.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.720
Yeah, so I was just wondering
how much we could expect--

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.620
new features is great, but I
mean like just kind of the

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.390
core, is the core kind of
solid, do you guys feel?

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.000
DANNY HERMES: So Cloud Endpoints
is actually more

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.050
than just an App Engine feature
because it uses a

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.300
shared infrastructure that all
of Google's APIs use as well.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.220
And so there's a fair amount
of discovery itself is a

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.790
specification, and there's also
a back end configuration,

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.460
which allows us to register with
that shared API service

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.060
and say this is what I look
like, this is the kind of

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.940
things that I want you to send
me, this is the kind of things

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:13.930
that I'll give back
to you, and other

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.190
related things like auth.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:17.960
So this is an active
conversation

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.940
which we have a lot.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.220
So I I'm happy to talk more
about it after, but.

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:23.600
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.660
It's great so far.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.360
ProtoRPC and everything
involved in that

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.415
looks great so far.

00:38:27.415 --> 00:38:27.910
Thank you, guys.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.160
DANNY HERMES: OK, cool.

00:38:35.335 --> 00:38:37.800
IDO GREEN: OK, thank
you very much.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.650
Bye bye.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.166
[APPLAUSE]
