00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.080
Hi.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm Phil Quitslund.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.370
And I'm an engineer on Dart
Editor, our lightweight and

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.080
powerful editor for Dart.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.470
In this video I'll give you a
tour of Dart Editor and its

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.880
many features to help developers
be more productive

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.620
for writing larger,
full-featured web apps.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.390
Dart Editor helps you write web
apps with Dart, the new

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.710
scalable web programming
language.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.950
The editor and language are part
of the open-source Dart

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.880
project, which also includes
libraries, a new virtual

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.460
machine, a package manager,
and more.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.520
Dart compiles to JavaScript to
run across the modern web.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.710
Let's see how to use
Dart Editor now.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.840
When you first start the Dart
Editor, you're greeted by the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.160
Welcome screen.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.590
From here, you can create a
new application, read more

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.470
about Dart, or run one
of many samples.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.290
For example, let's see what
this Solar app does.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.810
It simulates the planets
orbiting around the sun.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.960
Neat.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.640
Dart Editor isn't a
stock of clips.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.760
It's a completely standalone
editor optimized for Dart.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.420
You'll quickly see that Dart
Editor has clean menus in a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.090
significantly simplified UI.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.290
Even though things look more
simple, we still have powerful

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.780
features, such as auto-update
and configurable key bindings.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.530
If you already use Eclipse,
IntelliJ, or

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.970
WebStorm, you're in luck.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.630
These IDs also have Dart
plug-ins available.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.240
Dart Editor can help you learn
Dart with code navigation,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.930
code completion, and more.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.260
Let's see these features
in action.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.520
Here we are looking at
some new Dart code.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.620
I'm curious about this method
here, and I wonder how it's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.660
implemented.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.070
I can simply right-click on it
and choose Open Declaration.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.550
Dart Editor jumps me directly
to the methods definition.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.070
Dart Editor indexes all the
names in your project, making

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.670
it easier to find code.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.400
Once you find the code, you can
also easily find out where

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.670
else it's used.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.390
For example, I'm not sure
who uses this code.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.790
I can right-click on
the method name

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.570
and choose Find Callers.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.095
The Editor finds all the code
that uses the method so you

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:48.150
know where and how it's used.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.880
You can use this functionality
to help clean up your code.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.290
For example, it looks like
no-one else is using this

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.080
particular method.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.650
So I can delete it.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.010
Dart Editor also makes it easy
to find a name if you know

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.880
what it is.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.560
You can search across the
project for classes, methods,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.070
variable names, and more.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.450
For example, the other day my
buddy told me about some

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.250
reconnect logic she wrote.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.289
I searched for reconnect.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.750
And, sure enough, Dart Editor
finds a method called

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.210
scheduleReconnect.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.670
Along with navigating the code,
Dart Editor also makes

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.650
it easy to explore new APIs.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.830
Because Dart is structured and
has optional static types, the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.290
Editor can provide useful
code completion.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.400
Here I am working with an object
that I'm not familiar

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.480
with, and I'm not sure what
methods I can call.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.160
Dart Editor knows what type the
object is and can provide

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.310
me with a list of options
specific to this variable.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.640
Even if you don't use type
annotations, the Editor can

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.930
often infer types, and code
completion still works.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.860
In this example I used var for
my simple variable that holds

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.790
an integer.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.860
Notice how the Editor still
gives me useful code

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.130
completion proposals.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.970
Dart Editor can help you fix a
simple problem with a quick

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.310
keyboard shortcut.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.210
For example, the Editor can
apply various quick fixes for

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.780
missing methods or
missing classes.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.060
Here I've written some code that
uses a method that is not

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.070
yet defined.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.070
I clearly got ahead of myself,
but we can fix it.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.790
Simply use Control-1 to bring
up the Quick Fix menu, and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.910
you'll see a Create Method
option complete with

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.330
parameters and types.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.290
Once the method is created,
the error goes away.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.830
Other quick fixes include
Create Class, Import

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.930
Library, and more.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.630
Writing code is easy, but
maintaining it as requirements

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.430
change can be challenging.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.110
Dart Editor has built-in
refactoring support to help

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.820
you update the code as
the design evolves.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.140
The name I originally
picked for this

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.880
method can be more clear.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.930
I want to rename it, but I
also want to rename all

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.160
references across the project.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.970
Right-click on the method
and choose Rename

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.860
from the Context menu.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.440
After I choose a new
name, it's changed

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.680
all over the project.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.470
Repeating the same
code isn't ideal.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.060
So if you notice the same code
used more than once, you can

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.410
apply the Extract Method
refactoring.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.170
Here's code I've repeated
twice in the same file.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.370
It's a great candidate
for extract method.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.750
Highlight the code, right-click,
choose Extract

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.370
Method, and choose a name
for the new method.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.080
Notice how the original code is
replaced by a call to the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.910
new method.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.800
Quick fixes and refactorings are
helpful features to keep

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.770
you more productive.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.240
But what if you run into
a bug in your code?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.440
Dart Editor has a rich Debugger
to help you find and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.220
fix bugs quickly.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.220
The Debugger connects to
Dartium, our build of

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640
Chromium, with an embedded
Dart VM.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.770
You can set breakpoints,
step your code, inspect

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.630
variables, and more.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.250
Here's a sample Dart app,
which clearly has a bug.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.600
We can use the Debugger
to find the error.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.390
I start by checking if
this is a problem

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.290
with drawing the planet.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.520
I set a breakpoint inside
the drawSelf method of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.550
PlanetaryBody.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.380
The program stops when the
breakpoint is hit.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.630
Since the positions are wrong,
I'm curious about the point

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.570
values of x and y.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.060
Using the Debugger, I can
inspect variable values and

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.800
set watched expressions.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.170
I'm looking for anything
out of the ordinary.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.310
Here, I'm comparing x and
y with the previous

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.130
frames x and y.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.380
They're reversed.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.800
Sure enough, the bug
is in the code.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.580
It's a simple fix, and
I rerun the program.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.590
It works.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.710
You can avoid adding Debug.Print
statements to all

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.380
of your code by using the
Editor's built-in Debugger and

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.470
tight integration
with Dart VM.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.030
Dart Editor is open-source, and
we like to hear from our

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.440
developers.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.260

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.960
We just scratched the surface
of Dart Editor.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.570
We look forward to hearing
your feedback.
