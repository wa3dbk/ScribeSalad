TOM BROXTON: Hello.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.190
Good morning.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.930
Good afternoon, rather.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.870
This is Josh Sassoon.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.450
JOSH SASSOON: This
is Tom Broxton.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.070
TOM BROXTON: And we're
designers on the user

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.550
experience team at YouTube, and
we wanted to talk to you

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.600
today a bit about how we
design products in a

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.060
multi-screen world.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.410
We wanted to give you a bit of a
kind of a factory tour and a

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.870
peek behind the curtain of some
of the ways that we do

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.860
things at YouTube and some of
the reasons behind some of the

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.030
changes that you'll be seeing on
YouTube in the future, and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.640
then what some of those
might look like.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.430
We'd give you a little
sneak peek of that.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.830
So with that, I'll hand you over
to Josh, and he can begin

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.460
by telling you a little
bit about YouTube.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.310
JOSH SASSOON: So just to take a
big picture view of YouTube,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.970
YouTube is actually a
really, really tough

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.870
problem to design for.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.610
And when you think about
YouTube, it's probably just,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.310
up to a lot of people, a place
where you go for cat videos.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.680
But when you think about
YouTube as a corpus of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.640
content, it's a huge
unstructured, massive corpus

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.560
with a huge breadth
of content--

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.560
everything from cat videos
to revolutions--

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.010
and it really doesn't have
a consistent structure.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.800
YouTube is kind of this "Choose
Your Own Adventure"

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.140
experience.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.930
And it's important to or step
back from YouTube and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.580
understand what YouTube
is and what it isn't.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.190
And YouTube really isn't like
any other service out there.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.820
Nothing like it exists.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.330
YouTube is essentially
the container for the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.680
entire world of video.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.140
Everything is on YouTube.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.980
Everything on YouTube is
uploaded, and it can be

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.490
virtually anything.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.930
And on top of that, our
audience is everyone--

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.830
everyone across the world
and every demographic.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.410
Everyone watches YouTube.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.220
And what's great about YouTube
is it's unique in its ability

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.420
to provide for this incredible
universal experience.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.610
And it can also be an
incredibly personal

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.955
experience.

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:57.910
It's both of those things, so
we have to really find a

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.950
balance between that.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
We have to find a way to show
everyone in the world "Gangnam

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.730
Style." And on the more personal
level, I personally

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.290
am learning how to play the
violin off of a series of

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.479
YouTube videos from a creator
in a completely different

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.400
state, and it's very
personal to me.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.930
And that's a very different
experience than the universal.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.760
So the beauty of YouTube is
that there is this shared

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.250
experience that's universal, and
it's very collaborative.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.580
I think most everyone's heard
of the "Harlem Shake" meme

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.420
that came up recently, where
not only did it start on

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.970
YouTube, but it was actually
because of YouTube that

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.420
everyone was able to collaborate
and create these

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.180
videos and parody and mimic
each others' videos and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.370
actually create something that
wasn't there because of

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.660
YouTube as a platform.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.670
And then on the more personal
level, there's this really

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.870
intimate, social aspect to
YouTube, where people have

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.700
YouTube parties.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.120
They crowd around a phone or a
laptop, and everyone's dying

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.210
to share a video with
one another.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.660
So we have this incredible
challenge of balancing, again,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.560
the universal and the personal
and anything that can be a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.070
completely global phenomenon to
something that's very much

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.490
social and intimate that's just
your group of friends.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.970
And the end experience of
YouTube is incredibly hard to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.140
describe because of that.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.260
So most people will say that
YouTube is overwhelming, that

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.160
they can't really capture it
or describe in any way.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.960
It doesn't have enough structure
or anything that's

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.250
consistent enough about the
corpus of content to really

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.140
capture in any way.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.230
And there's this common feeling
amongst our viewers

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.020
that it's hard to decide what
to watch next or how to

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.660
discover something new or
how to find something

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.890
that they'll love.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.640
And on top of that, it's even
harder for them to refind it

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.430
or to collect it in a way where
they know how to keep

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.010
track of it.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.360
And so the general sentiment
is, I know that YouTube has

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.590
everything on it.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.450
I just don't know how
to make sense of it.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.260
And that's what makes it such a
tough problem to design for.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.020
TOM BROXTON: And so as YouTube
keeps growing and our

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.510
relationship with online video
grows and changes, and what

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.680
online video is grows and
changes, we're really moving

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.190
from being this web-based site
to being a service running

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.330
across a multiplicity
of devices.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.690
So we begin to think about
YouTube as a platform upon

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.330
which we can share content out
the world, to people wherever

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.860
they are and whatever
they're looking at.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:22.780
So at the moment, we feel that
we've got a series of apps,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.640
each specialized on their own
platform, that tries to take

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120
the best aspect of that platform
and allow you to get

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.150
to the content in the way that
that platform makes sense.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.930
But the problem with this is
that it gives the impression

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.710
to our viewers that something
you found or bookmarked or

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.770
saved in one place isn't
available in another place.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.000
And it doesn't give a great
sense of one service and one

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.220
set of videos that you're
looking on across the world.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.290
So as we work on our next
generation of product design,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.790
we're really thinking about how
can we harmonize that so

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.900
we can move away from this sort
of web first, and these

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.260
other devices second, to a
service that's at the center

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.820
of everything with thousands
of devices and thousands of

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.030
products that are pointing into
this, so you can connect

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.840
to the content you want at the
right time in whatever way

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.310
suits you best.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.820
And as designers, we really want
to provide this in a way

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.120
that's delightful and enjoyable
to everyone, to make

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.160
that connection experience
exciting.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.470
Because from cat videos to
revolutions, people tell us

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.610
about these amazing and
inspiring experiences that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.840
they have on YouTube.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.700
And we really see our job as
connecting those people

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.840
together and making it really
easy for those kind of

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.330
connections and experiences
to happen.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.260
So at Google, at YouTube, we
really believe that the way to

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.830
do this, the way to achieve
great design that is relevant

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.170
to people is to really
understand the people,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.020
understand the user and their
needs and what they're trying

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.050
to get out of things.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.320
So the problem with that is, as
Josh has already said, the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.410
breadth of our audience is
such that many of the

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.580
traditional methods that I
learned for understanding the

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.980
audience that are coming to your
site or to your service

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.180
are quite ineffective.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.980
So one of the great tools we
have to address this at

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.100
YouTube, or one of the great
assets we have to address this

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.310
at YouTube, is a strong research
team who can really

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.850
come up with some innovative
ways of addressing the user

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.360
needs, understanding user needs,
and finding ways to

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.060
address them.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.400
So they come up with some really
innovative methods,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.850
especially for attacking this
problem of how things change

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.960
as we move to a more
device-centric world.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.120
They've come up with some really
innovative ways to

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.880
tackle this.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.080
And I wanted to share some of
those with you, because I

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.620
think they're really
interesting, and then some of

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.730
the high-level insights that
we're taking away from those

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.350
and what we're learning about
why people use our service the

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.030
way they do.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.290
So just to explain
how this works.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.200
They've been running a series
of large-scale diary studies

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.820
when they send out these
booklets to volunteers, and

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.340
people record and share daily
activities about how video

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.400
consumption fits into
their life.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.840
There's a variety of exercises
in the books--

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.440
day-by-day diaries and these
time wheels that I'll explain

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.270
a little bit more in a moment.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.020
And the overall effect was
that they gave us some

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.130
insights into what people are
doing during the day.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:40.890
So this is the time wheel
diagram I was just describing,

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:45.150
and the idea of this is that
people can record and give us

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:50.260
insight into how their day
works, what devices they're

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.460
using to consume media and
video during the day.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.920
So here, the little markers
show where they are, what

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.360
they're doing.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.640
So you can see transport, on I'm
at home, or I'm at work,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.085
and who they're with as well, so
we get an understanding of

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:08.660
kind of social activity.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.230
And then the inside purple ring
is phone activity, and

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.860
you can see the short
phone interactions.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.630
And then we've got
a tablet wheel.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.930
The laptop is the yellow, and
TV is the long sessions that

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.100
you see on the outside.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.960
And then, we can take many,
many, many of these diagrams,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.419
and we can use many clever and
also not so clever methods of

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.460
processing them and looking at
patterns and try to get these

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.860
patterns and understand the
behaviors and motivations as

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.210
to why people pick up a
particular device and use it

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.470
in a particular way and
what they're trying

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.070
to get out of it.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.050
And then, we can check those
against the actual traffic

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.520
patterns that we see
coming to our site.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.620
And we can see how these things
match up, and there's a

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.820
lot of information you can
draw from that kind of

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.870
comparison.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.460
So to begin to get to some of
the insights that we're

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.040
drawing out of these--

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.820
that's just one method.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.530
There are quite a lot of other
pieces that we're using.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.640
So we try to draw all these
together into some insights

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.990
that I could share
with you today.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.890
And the most basic starting
ones are just some device

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.525
principles that as designers we
like to get down to a sort

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:24.660
of framework or a set of ideas
that we can all agree on so

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.040
that when we talk about phone
or tablet with each other as

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.420
we develop products, we'll have
a sort of basic, shared

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.770
understanding of how
these things work.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.340
So I want to share that with
you quickly to begin with,

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.500
because it underpins a lot
of what's following.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.310
So I'll just go through them
quickly, device by device.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.010
The phone is sort of typified by
this pattern you see in the

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.370
purple there of really morning
til evening, like I wake up

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.180
til I go to bed.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.570
It's always with me, and it's
these fast, frequent

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.450
interactions.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.250
You know how it is.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.620
You're always checking
your phone.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.445
You're almost like a chicken
pecking at the corn.

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:09.550
But what we do notice is that
a lot of this interaction is

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.320
reactionary.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:17.560
So people are really getting
status notifications or

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.710
updates, or people are telling
them about something.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.820
So phone-based interactions are
what we're thinking of as

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.300
reactionary.

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.520
And the other thing we really
notice about the phone--

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.540
and people talk about it
in interviews-- is

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.410
how personal it is.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:32.670
People are very unwilling
to let their phone go.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.130
So you've got a strong chance
that the person on the end of

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:38.550
that device is the person
you think it is.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.950
The only exception really to
this personality or the

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.930
personal nature of the phone
is in child pacification,

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.920
where we constantly see.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.630
And these are people who'll just
hand over any device to

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.810
get some peace.

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.030
So that's the one person
who might be on the

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.070
other end of the phone.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.320
And another surprise for us was
just that although people

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.930
often use the term phone and
mobile interchangeably, we're

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.040
trying to stop doing that,
because there's less mobile

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.770
usage on the phone then
you'd expect.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.820
I was expecting a lot of it to
be kind of on the bus or

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.300
traveling, and a lot of mobile
usage is actually at home.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.230
More than half of the usage
we're seeing is

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.480
from within the home.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:24.710
So the tablet, to kind of
contrast that, it seems to

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.310
have a slightly surrogate role
in people's lives, and the

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.310
usage is slightly unclear.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.520
People often talk about using
it instead of some other

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.990
device, so instead of my phone
or instead of my laptop or

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.750
something like that.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.090
The marked difference from the
phone is that usage seems to

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.480
be planned much more.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.850
People talk about downloading a
movie to watch later to take

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.800
on the bus, on the train, or I
want to read a book in bed.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.020
So it tends to be more
ritualistic and less habitual.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.640
And so that's leading us to
the conclusion that using

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.700
scaled up phone UIs on
the tablet is not

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.710
always the best idea.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.720
The reason people could
be using it

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.840
could be slightly different.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.580
And the surprising thing is
people don't seem be using

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.270
them-- at least for video--
people don't seem to be using

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.720
them as much as they
think they do.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.850
If you ask them in an interview,
they'll say, oh, I

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.710
always use my tablet.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.260
I love my tablet.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.070
And then when you look at the
patterns through the day, the

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:22.550
tablet usage is much lower than
they suggest themselves.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.760
The PC, just quickly,
is to perceived much

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.810
more as a work device.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.440
Usage is much more
in the daytime.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.480
This is especially true with
the arrival of the tablet.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.160
People, as I said, instead of,
people are switching much more

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.570
of their usage towards
the tablet.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.780
And the other interesting
point we noticed--

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.640
even though we think so much
about living in a kind of

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.180
post-desktop world,
post-keyboard world, there are

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.780
still so many organizational
tasks that people can't

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.080
achieve through these
other interfaces.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.480
People still talk about turning
back to their laptop

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.010
as a control panel and as
a device to, in the end,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.640
organize things and
complex tasks.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.270
And finally, the TV is still
sort of the epicenter of video

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.820
consumption.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.870
Everything else seems to
revolve around the TV.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.650
Sessions are longer,
less interactive.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:11.910
You see these big orange bars.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.390
And they're pretty constant.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.200
Through all of the research
that we're doing, we see

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.290
people have it on in
the background.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.280
It's often associated
with multitasking.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.350
You'll see the phone or the
tablet, all these things being

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.260
used at the same time.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.800
And our important takeaway for
the TV is really that it's a

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.570
shared device or it's
a social device.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.190
People are very aware that there
are many people looking

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.820
at the screen at
the same time.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.930
So be careful about what you
put up on the TV and are

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.890
sharing, since through
social data, people

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.500
don't appreciate that.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.760
There's a couple of interesting
trends or sort of

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.210
continuums that we notice that
run across all the devices in

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.570
the order that I showed them.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.930
So as you go from a small screen
size to a large screen

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.030
size, session length
and the length of

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.190
videos viewed increases.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.860
It's kind of intuitively
sensible, right?

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.610
You're more likely to watch
a movie on the TV.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.130
But also, interactions
go down.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.090
So people want to interact
less with a screen that's

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.710
bigger and further away.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.900
And whereas phone is a habitual
device-- the way

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.810
we're describing is phone is
habitual device, and the TV is

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.540
a ritualistic device.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.700
People have times of day when
they want to go to their TV,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.920
but as I said, they kind of pick
up and use the phone all

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.980
through the day.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.290
And again, it seems to kind of
spread according to the screen

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.310
size across all of
the devices.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.650
And the personal
issue as well.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.792
Phone is a very personal device,
and TV is seen as a

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:44.590
very social device, and tablet
somewhere in the middle.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.820
I'm sort of happy to share my
tablet in the way that I'm not

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.070
happy to share my phone.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.500
So the second insight that
really came out of this

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.860
research was thinking about the
time of day and how people

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.050
use their devices
through the day.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.010
And the main key takeaway
underlying all of this was

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.360
really just people are
incredibly busy.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.220
They've got these
furious lives.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.185
They're picking up kids.

00:15:09.185 --> 00:15:12.410
They're working, doing all this
stuff, and it's really

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:15.060
important to fit into
their schedule.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.120
So when we listen to our users,
we hear, especially

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.670
with the phone, that I need
to be in control.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.060
I want to decide when I
come in and go out.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:27.470
I don't want to be distracted
too much.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.710
So we need to get out of their
way at the right moment.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.260
And ideally, they really want
us to get us to where they

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.890
want to be without them
having to ask.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.930
Obviously, the less
interaction they

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.360
can get, the better.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.390
So when we think about what
they're doing went through the

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:50.470
day, a pattern that emerges as
successful is sort of punchy,

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.360
short news content
in the morning.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.230
People are quite ritualistic
about checking in and finding

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.350
out what's going on at the
beginning of the day.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.320
And then easygoing, pushed at
you entertaining content in

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.690
the evening, when perhaps you
want to switch off a bit more

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.525
and you don't want to be
constantly making choices.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.340
So that tracks by
device as well.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.850
So the phone, you tend to see
these sort of short, frequent

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.000
status-snacking behavior.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.150
And UIs that work well with
that tend to be these more

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:29.600
feed-like UIs, where I can
check in, find out

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.760
what's going on.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.450
I want a sense of what's
going on in the world.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:40.640
Whereas on TV, something more
static and relaxing, less

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.720
about scrolling, more about
what's the content that I want

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.570
to be watching next
and you tell me.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:53.660
So a third aspect that helps us
when we're trying to think

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.900
about designing these different
UIs is thinking

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.300
about the level of control and
trust that people need to have

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.330
over an interface.

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.569
So there are two sort
of modalities of

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:08.390
behavior that we see--

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.410
the "I know what I want" versus
the "Entertain me." We

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.450
notice that they
call for really

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.500
two separate UI paradigms.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.400
One end of this continuum we're
thinking of as like

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.109
trust based and one
control based.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.800
And if we think about a user's
intent along this continuum,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.910
it helps us to design a feature,
a and what to watch

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.090
next after you've watched one
video on TV is an interesting

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.620
example of this.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.120
On TV, we have the added
challenge that we've got these

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.180
very limited control input
devices, the D-pad controls.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.010
And combine that with this
idea that we're trying to

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.160
optimize for these long,
relaxing evening sessions, and

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.730
we really find that the last
thing you want is to kind of

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.940
bombard people with these
horrific walls

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.285
of choices of videos.

00:17:56.285 --> 00:17:59.360
So it works quite well on the
PC or on the desktop, where

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.350
you give people lots of choices,
and they can see what

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.110
it is they're after.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.370
On the TV, you show somebody a
wall of videos like this, and

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:05.620
they'll just turn it off.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.850
As somebody pointed out, it's
sort of like asking a kid,

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:11.940
what vegetables do you
want for dinner?

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.780
And they'll just be like,
nothing, or chips.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.360
They'll jump back to what
they're familiar with.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.650
Whereas you might be better
off asking them something

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.250
like, do you want broccoli
or carrots?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.460
And then you kind of
more likely to

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.920
get a useful reaction.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.070
And it's kind of the same with
video consumption as well.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.110
We find if you give them a big
bombardment of choice, they

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.310
tend to react badly.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:37.250
You give them a small number
of choices, then people are

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.020
much more positive about
taking one of them.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.365
So what we try to say with these
kind of interfaces is

00:18:43.365 --> 00:18:45.930
here's what we think you
want to watch next.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.020
You might also like--

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.460
So we still give some
opportunity for serendipity

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.350
and a little bit of control,
like letting people go, but

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.390
we're really concentrating
on trust.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.850
And we're experimenting with
different ideas and different

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:05.730
UIs, title cards that might
allow more sort of insight

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.090
into the set of videos that
you're watching such that we

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.480
gain sort of extra trust at
the beginning of the talk,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.660
that you can really have more
faith that the videos that are

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.290
coming up are the kind of videos
that you're going to

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.700
want to be watching, rather than
giving the people this

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.080
feeling that I'm just
lost in the sea of

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.360
thousands of videos.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.570
That way, I can lean back
and enjoy the content.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:33.540
The opposite end of the scale
to this might be when people

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.730
really want control.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.550
And as I said before, an
interface that's really great

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.410
for this is the phone.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.900
And so, we're really looking
at ways that we can combine

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.770
these experiences.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.350
So you might already see, we've
already got a UI that

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.570
allows you to connect the phone
YouTube experience to

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:59.790
your TV or to any other
large screen and let

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.100
you pair the two.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.550
So you can send a video
from one to the other.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.840
And these are incredibly
successful at achieving this

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.400
kind of high control.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.405
How do I get to the video I
want, and then how do I share

00:20:10.405 --> 00:20:11.650
it with people?

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.280
And the reaction's incredible.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.100
If they can find it,
people describe the

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.770
experience as magical.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:21.110
Especially if you've ever tried
to input a text search

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.620
through using a D-pad control,
you'll just know that these

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.888
kind of interfaces are
light years apart.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:36.230
And the final piece that's
helping us coming out of this

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.010
and various other research is
the emotional connection.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.670
So I mentioned earlier how some
of the more traditional

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.150
frameworks for thinking about
who your users are and what

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.370
they want out of your products
are not working or don't work

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.900
so well when you're user
base grows beyond

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.510
the hundreds of millions.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.540
So we're really having to find
new ways of trying to

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.620
empathize with people.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.680
And again, the research team
have come up with some pretty

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.080
innovative thinking
around this.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.610
And so rather than thinking
about the personas and the

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.360
type of people coming to
YouTube, they're pushing us to

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.780
think about people's
motivations

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.080
behind why they're coming.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.820
And they're putting together
a framework that presents

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.880
content in such a way that it
can fit to people's moods.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.410
And we see this as making it
more likely for them to engage

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.060
with the content in
a positive way.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.810
So an example I'm sort of giving
here of a framework we

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.440
might be trying to feel out is
under "feeling," we think

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.390
about people seeking a mood,
following a story.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.170
I'll give some examples
of that.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.950
And then "learning," I guess,
is more obvious.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.960
We've got a lot of educational
content, but we also see a lot

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:46.000
of how-to videos and
reviews on YouTube.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.900
And that's very important,
popular content.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.480
"Knowing." We were talking about
people sort of being in

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.950
the know and finding out
what's new and popular.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.910
A lot of people come and they
want to see the latest videos.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.130
So how do we accommodate
those?

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.490
What's the right UI for somebody
coming in in that

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:03.950
kind of frame of mind?

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:08.500
And then "connecting" is
comments and discussions, but

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.820
also sharing with friends,
how we take

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.880
those experiences back.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.460
And that hopefully connects
people back to the top of the

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.670
circle, where you can connect
with your friends and share a

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.810
feeling with them, and then
they can learn and share.

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.940
And that kind of framework, it
helps us build our use cases

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.230
and think about what success is
for a product and what we

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.350
should expect people
to get out of it.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.190
An example of where
you might apply it

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.240
could be through language.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:42.160
So "make me laugh" could well
be a phrase that is more

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.750
likely to trigger a positive
reaction to the kind of

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.990
content people want to connect
with than, say, "pets and

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.290
animals," which is the more
logical place you might want

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.560
to go to look for cat videos.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.780
But people don't really come in
looking for cat videos and

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.270
then think, oh, I'll click on
"pets and animals." But if you

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.370
say "make me laugh," they can
kind of relate to that.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.840
So with that, I'll hand it back
to Josh, who's going to

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.035
explain a little bit about how
you can apply these kind of

00:23:07.035 --> 00:23:08.890
lessons to design.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.000
JOSH SASSOON: So as Tom
mentioned, we do a ton of

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.420
qualitative research to
address a lot of our

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.020
challenges.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.080
And what we need to do in
combination with that is use

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.220
data and quantitative analysis
to really kind of finish the

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.350
entire design process and make
sure that we're thinking about

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.280
this in a well-rounded manner.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.470
So we think a lot about how can
database design actually

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.460
help us with our design
decisions when we're trying to

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:35.570
organize and present
videos to viewers.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.620
And we use a lot of analysis to
try and figure out how can

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.200
we go from something that feels
messy to something that

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.440
feels very intentional and

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.990
something that feels organized.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.510
And within something that feels
organized, how much

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:47.580
hierarchy do we show?

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.730
How much density or how
much diversity of

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.560
content do we show?

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.430
And a lot of our analysis on
the quantitative side can

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.240
really help us with that.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.980
We have tons and tons of ideas
as we do design explorations.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.420
But as Tom said, at the scale of
our user base, it's really

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.000
hard to just go with your
gut and say, this

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.810
is going to be great.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.180
Because that doesn't really work
for the entire world or

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.540
for hundreds of millions
of people.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.560
So we really need to use
data to validate

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.190
a lot of our ideas.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.980
And this is just an exploration
where we use

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.430
quantitative analysis to think
about, how big is a thumbnail?

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.710
How often do we group and
cluster thumbnails together?

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.970
How can we actually balance
density and diversity?

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.730
How can we show through one
UI across platforms a nice

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.180
balance of universal and
personal content together and

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.270
make it feel easy to
understand and not

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.310
overwhelming, depending on
what device you're using?

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.570
This is an exploration where
we're really thinking just

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.000
about tons and tons
of diversity.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.860
Just show a lot of stuff, and
hopefully people will make a

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:51.520
good decision.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:57.530
But then, we'll do another
exploration that's similar but

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.810
much more minimal and
much less dense.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.340
And we can run these two
things together as an

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:06.840
experiment, and through
quantitative analysis, we can

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.770
really make better decisions
about what really does work

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.290
better and what leads our
viewers to longer, more

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:15.260
successful sessions
on our product.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.050
And this is an exploration,
actually, where we're

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.190
thinking, how can quantitative
analysis help us determine

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.390
what layout to use?

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.240
Should there be any hierarchy?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.950
And in the case of this, this
is a very dense exploration

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.720
that feels very newsy and
has a masonry layout.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.990
And how much hierarchy should
we expose at all?

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.350
How much does this actually
impact our viewers' perception

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.870
of YouTube as a destination that
they need to come back to

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.700
often as a news source or as a
newsfeed versus something that

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.730
feels very editorial and curated
and is much less

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.980
dense, and perhaps only shows
one to two pieces of content

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.520
above the fold?

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.080
And we have to think about all
of these explorations in the

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.390
spectrum, and on top of all
that, think about them across

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.230
platforms and think, how does
this actually translate and

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.110
become recognizable when you
take that same design and you

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.690
throw it onto a tablet or you
throw it onto a phone?

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.900
And what does that
actually mean?

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.980
A lot of the stuff that Tom
spoke about earlier--

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.690
the need for more control or
perhaps more personal snacking

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:19.470
on a phone--

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.600
is very different on a phone
than on desktop, where you

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.560
want a ton of options and
perhaps a lot more diversity

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.600
and even a sense of more
hierarchy to help you quickly

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.270
identify a type of content
you want to watch.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.640
This is another interesting
place that we use quantitative

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.890
analysis, which is actually
analyzing our channel creators

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.150
and their content and figuring
out what type of content they

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.620
actually have and how we can
group it together and make it

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.410
more meaningful and how we can
present what they want to

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.470
watch next from a channel--
whether it's episodic content

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.790
that's meant to be viewed
sequentially or whether it's

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:58.110
music content or whether it's
from a large library of videos

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.890
that don't actually need to be
viewed in a certain order.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.410
We've got tons and tons of
creators that are making

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.230
amazing new types of content
that don't fall into the

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.330
traditional, sequential sort
of show or movie sort of

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:10.930
content types.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.690
So we have to really work hard
to analyze and understand what

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.210
our creators are doing and then
find the best ways to

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:19.680
actually present that and
cluster it to show viewers and

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.910
subscribers on our
browse pages.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.270
So that kind of takes us to some
of the explorations that

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.660
we're taking from all of these
insights and actually moving

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.240
closer to a little bit of a
sneak peek into how we're

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.000
trying to solve the problems
we've just been discussing.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.660
And some of it is just
really obvious--

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.520
identifying primary user needs
and actually streamlining them

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.650
visually across platforms and
doing things that actually

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.780
connect our core actions in
a unified visual language.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.060
Something as simple as taking
our subscribe button and

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.840
making sure that it scales and
is recognizable across

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.840
platforms actually does a huge
amount to help our viewers

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.800
recognize and understand that
when they subscribe to

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.540
something, that actually
means something.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.540
And when they pick up their
phone after they subscribe on

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.680
desktop, that that same channel
and that content will

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.790
be there, or that they'll
be able to refind it

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.170
later on their TV.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.280
And that, again, we're a
service, and not just a site

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.490
that has a bunch of disparate
apps connected with it.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.850
Some of the other work that
we're doing is just doing some

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.540
basic unification, both visually
and in our UI, of our

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:23.760
navigation.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.430
Getting our viewers to
understand every time you open

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.780
up YouTube on any platform
that that navigation will

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.420
actually get you back
consistently to the place that

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.260
you recognize, whether it's
the What to Watch feed or

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.560
whether it's a specific
channel.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.860
And that kind of takes us into
this bigger picture that we're

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.840
thinking of for YouTube and a
lot of the design principles

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.090
we've already mentioned.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.860
But thinking about YouTube as
this single service that

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.080
transcends or goes across any
platform, that's easy.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.430
It has this basic underlying
structure that you can

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.320
understand, that helps balance
the universal and the personal

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.460
and makes the experience at any
time of day, any type of

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.490
user, any type of content
understandable.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.210
And then balance that with
what YouTube is kind of

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.880
culturally known for, which is
a serendipitous, fun kind of

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.610
silly place, a place for
adventure and delight.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.410
A place for potentially
education and news, but also a

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:26.280
place that is just as much a
library for everything that

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.720
you love in the world
in video, as well

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.970
as a place for fun.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.460
TOM BROXTON: So to bring all of
that together, I guess what

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.710
we're trying to do is strive for
recognizability but not be

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.690
dogmatic about the consistency
for the sake of consistency.

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:48.120
We still want each platform
to take advantage of its

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.670
strengths s so that we can
get to a future that's

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.500
recognizably a consistent family
of products living off

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.700
this one service in the center
that's optimized for the

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.420
strengths and opportunities of
each, and really give people

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.330
the right content for the right
device at the right time

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:09.730
of day, lets them get in and get
out when they need to, and

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.500
remembers where they are
when they come back.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.470
JOSH SASSOON: That's it.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.720
Thank you.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:23.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.080
TOM BROXTON: So we even left
a little bit of time for

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.020
questions if anybody has any.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.630
And if not, there is a
page for feedback.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.800
So if you want to give feedback,
you can scan the QR

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.360
code, or I think you can get
to it through the site.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.850
And it's all gratefully
received.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:43.810
Thank you.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.420
JOSH SASSOON: Thank
you for coming.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.280
AUDIENCE: Just one question
about the options you

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.590
presented earlier, the variants
of the teasers you

00:30:54.590 --> 00:31:02.000
put on the YouTube main page.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.670
What's your criteria to say
if it's successful?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.570
Is it just click-through rate?

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.670
Is it how long the user stays
after he clicks one video?

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:17.420
What's the main goal on this
first on the start?

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.270
TOM BROXTON: Do you
want me to start?

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.250
JOSH SASSOON: Sure.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.990
TOM BROXTON: It varies from
exploration for exploration.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.410
I mean, both of those
two things are very

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:26.570
interesting to us.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.910
The immediate click-through
rate, the effect that changing

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.160
something on the site has, is
definitely interesting.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.740
But also, of course, the longer
term, like does it lead

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.580
to longer number of clicks?

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.940
What are the kind of videos
that it leads to viewing?

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.940
How does that affect the
relationship of the viewer

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.690
with the creator of the
video behind it?

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:52.020
So I'd say that it's difficult
to think of one common thing.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.750
But the common principle would
be to make sure that we

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:58.250
understand those in advance of
running the experiment, right?

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.890
It's far too easy to run an
experiment and then look at a

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.890
bunch of numbers and to try
and pick out the winner

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.080
afterwards.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.200
JOSH SASSOON: I mean right now,
it's really hard to come

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.970
up with a good success metric,
because we're looking for

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:13.680
longer-term behavioral change.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.330
We want people to come to the
Home page and make a better

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.520
decision instead of just
watching something and

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.090
abandoning it right away or
watching something that may

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.490
lead to some other series
of random watches.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.300
We'd rather people get really
invested and understand what

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.710
they're watching and, depending
on the context,

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.920
watch it longer if they're in a
place like on a device where

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.600
there is the potential
to watch it longer.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.710
Or at least have a high-quality
session where

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.365
they make it through the video
and they make a good decision.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.900
AUDIENCE: A question about the
dual-screen experience.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.130
We haven't seen that.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.290
How did you guys think about
basically designing a

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.690
dual-screen experience where
you use a tablet to control

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.080
what you see on a TV?

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.810
TOM BROXTON: I lost the end
of your question there.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.080
As we've designed a dual-screen
experience--

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:05.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:10.150
How do you go after
designing it?

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.190
TOM BROXTON: Yeah, OK.

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:19.210
I think a lot of our initial
impulse is driven out of the

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.000
frustration we see
with search.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.410
So if you look at our TV
experiences, you'll see the

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.880
dual-screen experience promoted
a lot from there,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.030
because that's where we see
the biggest advantage for

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.700
people when they're having

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.790
frustration typing in controls.

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:39.930
So that's one of the places
where we started.

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:45.530
And then, the other part of
where it came from was really

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.240
thinking about, as I say, all
of the products working

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.126
together off a common service.

00:33:52.126 --> 00:33:55.720
So rather than trying to build
specific remote control apps,

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.650
as we'd seen other people do, we
were trying to think about

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:02.080
well, I really should be able
to search for my content

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.430
anywhere and play it anywhere.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.690
So that was one of the
underlying principles of the

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:08.889
UI we were trying to develop.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.260
And not develop new apps, but
think about, OK, we've already

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.179
got a mobile phone app.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:14.670
And we've already
got a TV app.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.469
What's the best way of
connecting these two together,

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:21.320
and how do I really want to
use these two things?

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.100
There's a sort of famous use
case for YouTube, right, that

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.239
we all know about where
everybody's got a video that

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:30.449
they want to show everybody.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.330
And so everybody's waiting to
queue up and play their

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.949
favorite video, so that was sort
of one of the underlying

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.780
motivations was how do we
make that really easy.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.239
So if we can all find that video
on our phone and play it

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.929
on the TV, that's a great win.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.800
I'd say the difficulty is
balancing all of the different

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.969
use cases together that don't
always interact, the way that

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:57.360
use case works next to, oh, I've
just got a playlist that

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.800
I want to put up on the TV and
leave running during a party.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.910
The two can be kind of in
conflict with each other.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:18.410
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to ask,
when you're designing for

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.340
cross device, are you having
any of those devices drive

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.290
what the rest of the devices
are looking like?

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:24.830
Are you starting from the
phone and bringing it to

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.570
tablet elsewhere?

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:30.200
And then, do you feel like
you're compromising on some of

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.460
these devices because you're
trying to maintain

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:33.180
consistency?

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.980
Like, is this truly the best
tablet experience, or is it

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.890
the best that you can
do with consistency?

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.340
JOSH SASSOON: I mean, I came
from designing for desktop for

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.130
almost two years.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.850
And so it's really easy to
fall into this pattern of

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.190
every feature exists on desktop,
so we're just going

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.030
to try and wedge it into mobile
or figure out how does

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.930
that work on TV.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.580
And the reality is we just
make really concerted

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.770
decisions to constrain and say,
we just don't need to do

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.500
half of these things for
certain devices.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.800
So we've really started to
reapproach some of our new

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.210
projects, from thinking
about, how does

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.360
this start with mobile?

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.710
How does it start
on the tablet?

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.920
How does it start on the TV?

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.410
And we're really starting to
think about desktop as an

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.230
equal instead of the first
thing we think about.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.600
And so it's actually a pretty
interesting time for us right

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.470
now, because we're doing
all these explorations.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.680
And granted, many of them
do start with desktop.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.550
We're actually making sure that
we put mobile or tablet

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.370
on an equal playing field in
those explorations and say,

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:33.750
what do you actually really need
when you're staring at

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.250
your phone?

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.570
And 99% of the time, all the
things that we do on desktop

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:41.840
don't translate exactly or even

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.930
necessarily need to be there.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.260
So again, as Tom said, we
think about familiarity.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.780
We're not trying to just make
it absolutely consistent.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.040
We just want to make sure that
when you're looking at your

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.090
phone and your desktop,
you feel like

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:53.900
you're using YouTube.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.550
But the thing that you really
need from the phone is very

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.310
different from what you need
on the desktop experience.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.770
TOM BROXTON: I'd say just to add
to that that's definitely

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.000
part of the motivation that
was driving a lot of the

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.710
qualitative research that
we talked about.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.870
Because I think it's
so easy to have an

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.200
assumption of knowledge.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.040
We have so many learned patterns
from so many years of

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.650
building a very large website
that we wanted to really

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.410
immerse ourselves in the ways
of thinking of people using

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:22.500
other devices.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.850
So that was part of the driver
behind that project.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.840
AUDIENCE: So if you were going
to add a new capability into

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.240
the YouTube service, where
would you start?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.400
Would you look across and say,
OK, I'm trying to design

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.790
simultaneously across
all of them?

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.720
Or do you have one where you
would start and then try to

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.280
loop it back around?

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.420
JOSH SASSOON: Some of the new
features, we're thinking right

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.570
away about how does it work
across platforms.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.310
I mean, it's kind of
overwhelming, because we're

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.760
trying to do it all.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.580
And we'll see how that works.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.880
But I think a lot of the
explorations now start with

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.040
mobile, mobile and desktop.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.320
And then, TV is kind of the
next thing we think about.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.260
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
touch on some of the user

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:10.660
research that you guys has been
doing around kind of how

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:15.920
people watch TV on a large,
10-foot experience.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.120
Do you see the need to have
TV kind of be this like

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:28.520
painkiller/zoning out use case
dwindling with kind of

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.600
co-viewing applications and all
the research that shows

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.880
that people are just spending
increasingly large amount of

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:38.300
time actually doing stuff while
they're watching TV,

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.890
whether it's just being
on Facebook on

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:40.700
their phone or Twitter?

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.330
It just feels like less of a
relaxing use case, and I'm

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.030
just curious how that might
change your perception of what

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.380
it's about in that 10-foot
experience and how that

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.300
changes the UI.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:52.680
TOM BROXTON: I agree.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.040
And yeah, we're definitely
seeing this same pattern.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:00.800
At the same time, the latest
research we're doing just

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.860
seems to suggest the TV's
on more and in a

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.180
more passive role.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:10.300
The more it's used, at the same
time, the more we see the

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.710
two things going on together,
the less interactive and the

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.830
more background role the
TV seems to gain.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:18.870
Yeah.

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:24.610
But then, I think that the
rise of these dual-screen

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.380
applications may change
that a lot.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.680
I think they've got
a long way to go.

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.370
I was at CES earlier this year,
and just everybody's

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:35.360
throwing out these sort
of dual-screen apps.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.630
And I think there's going to be
a kind of madness of them

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.910
for a while.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:42.810
And so how that affects what's
appearing on the main screen

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.410
while we all play with our
iPods is interesting.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:52.040
But I can't predict the pattern
yet of how that's

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.372
going to evolve.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.430
And I think we're running out of
time, so that might have to

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:00.590
be the last question.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.270
Thank you all very
much for coming.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.912
