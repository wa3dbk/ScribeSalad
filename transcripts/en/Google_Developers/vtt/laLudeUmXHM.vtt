Hi, I'm Aaron, a programmer working on the
extension system for Google Chrome.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.469
One of the most powerful features of our system
is the ability to interact with web pages.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.630
This is done with a feature called 'content
scripts'.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.330
Using a content script, an extension developer
can do things like: find unlinked URLs in

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.860
web pages and convert them into links, download
all images on a page, or add in-page integration

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.800
with a third-party application.
Content scripts do all of this by interacting

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.020
with a web page's Document Object Model, or
its "DOM" for short.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.890
The DOM is a tree-like data structure that
represents the HTML for a web page.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300
This is the same API that is used by web developers
today to make modern web applications like

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.620
Google Maps.
With extensions, the DOM for a web page is

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.760
shared between the page's JavaScript and each
of the content scripts that is also interacting

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.970
with that page.
Any of the scripts can modify the DOM, for

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.620
example by removing a node, and all the scripts
will immediately see the change.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.970
We want to share the structure of the DOM
between web pages and content scripts, but

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.689
it is important for robustness that the scripts
themselves are isolated from each other.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.749
For example, it should be possible for the
web page to use jQuery v1.2 and the content

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.899
script to use jQuery v1.3 without the two
versions of the library accidentally interfering

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.409
with each other.
Also, since extensions have access to privileged

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.679
APIs and sensitive user data, we need to make
sure that the web page JavaScript cannot use

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.539
the shared DOM as a way to get access to those
APIs and that data.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.439
In Google Chrome, we keep content scripts
isolated from each other and from the pages

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.490
they are running on with a system called 'isolated
worlds'.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.600
Each script that is accessing the DOM runs
in its own isolated world. Each isolated world

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.649
gets its own clean JavaScript environment,
which ensures that libraries don't conflict

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.050
with each other.
Many isolated worlds can share access to a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.439
single DOM tree, but when they do, they each
get their own complement of JavaScript objects

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.509
to represent the nodes in the tree.
Since no JavaScript objects are shared between

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.419
isolated worlds, it is not possible for web
page JavaScript to use the shared DOM to "break

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:09.929
out" of the normal web page sandbox and somehow
get access to the content script or its APIs.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.000
With content scripts, extension developers
can take full advantage of the familiar DOM

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
API to manipulate web pages.
And because of isolated worlds, they can do

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.970
this without having to worry about web pages
or other extensions accidentally interfering.

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.569
