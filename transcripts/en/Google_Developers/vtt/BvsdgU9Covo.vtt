IDO GREEN: Welcome to another
episode of GDL Israel.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.455
Today we have Nissim
Betito with us.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.570
Thank you for coming and
joining, of course.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.930
NISSIM BETITO: Thank you.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.300
IDO GREEN: And without further
ado, we promise you that we

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
jump into what ChromeOS is
basically allowing developers

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.632
and hackers, in the
current state.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:35.020
Quite different, the world
that we have today

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.630
from pixel to others.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.000
And how you could basically
develop and write code when

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.130
you're using Chromebook.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.910
So there are two or three
slides that we prepared.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.040
Let's share them.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:56.540
And first and foremost, it's
quite clear that today with

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710
all the movement to the cloud
we see more and more IDEs

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.220
basically allowing you
great functionality.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.920
And lets you be productive when
you're working with your

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.060
Chromebook.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.140
Cloud9, ShiftEdit, Neutron
Drive, all of them are working

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620
with Google Drive.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.030
Some of them are a nice
integration with Dropbox.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.820
And Cloud9, for instance, is
letting you work with GitHub.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.060
Repositories.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.710
So it's very easy and very
straightforward to work with,

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.980
when you have your Chromebook.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.420
Let me try and basically share
with you my Cloud9

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.670
environment.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.930
And as you can see, I already
installed it.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.500
So you can see that I have the
option to launch the app from

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.880
Chrome Web Store.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.700
And basically when I'm launching
the app, I have here

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.900
a nice dashboard that
I could open.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.310
And because we don't have too
much time, I'll just open

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.870
immediately a project
that I already did.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.210
Now the beauty here is that
the project is hosted on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.800
GitHub, so if you want to have
nice collaboration with your

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.450
teammates you could
definitely do so.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.670
And here in the file, you have a
full blown IDE that lets you

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.539
use your keyboard with nice
shortcuts, for people that are

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.830
used to different IDEs.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.350
And with some nice things that
are suggesting how to improve

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.730
and make our code
more readable.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.520
Of course you could run it later
on, and there are some

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.740
very, very cool capabilities
that Cloud9 specifically

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.300
letting you know.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.230
Using HTML5 client side offline
APIs from file, to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.460
local storage, to IndexedDB.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.180
And it's quite nice to see how
they're leveraging it.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.210
Other options, and quite a lot
of options that you can see

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.270
here, are some that are hosted
on Google Cloud.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.200
Some are not.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.020
And we highly encourage you just
to check and see what is

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.890
the best tool to accomplish
your job.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.820
So one option is just to take
and use a current IDE that you

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.350
have out there.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.110
But for the ones that want to
hack a little bit more and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.320
feel what ChromeOS looks like,
we do have the options to run

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.080
ChromeOS in VirtualBox.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.990
And actually in VMware
as well.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.710
So we'll put this slide
up there after

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.560
we finish the show.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.810
But you have your link to a
blog post that I wrote,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.870
actually now it's almost
two years--

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.970
a year and a half.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.930
And basically it lets you test
drive ChromeOS in VirtualBox.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.760
Quite nice, and you could
get the feeling of

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.040
how it looks like.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.380
And what things you
could do with it.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.010
Other good option for people
that like to hack with

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.540
hardware is to install ChromeOS
on the SD card.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.140
And then run it side by side
with your Chromebooks.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.460
For instance you could install
Ubuntu or any other version of

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.420
Linux on the SD card, and have
the ability to work on

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.520
ChromeOS with the online IDEs.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.690
Or just launch and have another
operation system that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.110
is installed on the
Chromebook.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.360
And if it's-- in our case,
we'll show you Ubuntu--

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.500
you have everything there from
Java to LAMP, Apache, MySQL,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.630
all the things that you want.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.510
And [? at the end of
the day it's ?]

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.810
Ubuntu.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.990
So you could go and get
pretty wild with it.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.760
For the brave ones, you could
just install side by side the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.394
operations system and have a
full blown dual boot machine.

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:25.140
Or just install [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.020
So the last thing is that of
course before you are going

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.530
and want to hack your
Chromebook, you must enter

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.460
development mode.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.190
The good thing about it
is that you will be

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.140
able to exit it.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.160
So you won't ruin your
Chromebook in

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.920
case things are scary.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.320
How to enter development mode.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.150
So are the three steps.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.380
But we'll put the first links
that just elaborate and show

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.530
you exact step by step what
you need to do in

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.893
order to enter it.

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:57.900
After you enter the development
mode, there are a

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.305
few steps that basically pull
from GitHub and operations

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:07.440
that customize citron that
lets you run Ubuntu on

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.270
Chromebook.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.410
And how you do it and how it
looks like, we'll just let

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.980
Nissim explain to us how
we did this magic.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.480
So let's stop the
screen sharing.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.570
And do you want to
move the camera?

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.845
OK, first explain, and then.

00:05:25.845 --> 00:05:26.120
OK.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.710
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.760
So hey guys.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.550
In the end the main goal is to
just, at least as I prefer to

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.180
do, a side by side
installation.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.290
That way you know that
you don't damage your

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.990
hardware in any way.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.480
And then it's an easy way to
create if you like to develop

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.450
or to use it for all kinds of
purpose to create an SD card.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.020
It's really cheap.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.090
You're just creating
all kinds of Ubuntu

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.890
flavor on your SD card.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.950
What we have here today
is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.130
machine.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.820
The Samsung I5 Chromebook.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.750
I already turned it on to
the development mode.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.210
And I changed that.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.578
And if they will hold the
camera for a second.

00:06:12.578 --> 00:06:13.035
IDO GREEN: Yeah.

00:06:13.035 --> 00:06:13.950
I'll take the camera out.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.110
And we'll just flip, and
see the nice views.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.170
NISSIM BETITO: So I inserted the
SD card into the laptop.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.300
In the end what we are going
to do after developer mode.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.510
If I turn the machine you can
see the screen that is showing

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.550
us that we are in
developer mode.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.170
If we leave it like that it will
just start booting and go

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.420
to a kind of ChromeOS
questioning mode.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.120
It will give you the option to
install your OS or to change

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.910
the version that you
are running.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.700
But by pressing Control U on
the machine, it's basically

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.825
giving the OS the command to
change to a different SD card

00:06:58.825 --> 00:06:59.625
boot [? mode. ?]

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:03.010
IDO GREEN: We'll try to capture
that now the loading

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.890
script is on.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.670
NISSIM BETITO: So exactly from
this step and on what we have

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.500
here is a regular Linux boot
mode that in a sec you will

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.160
see the Ubuntu 12.4
booting up.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.090
And in that distribution that we
installed, we installed the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.655
full Ubuntu OS straight
from the repository

00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:30.610
that we have online.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.910
You have LibreOffice.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:36.000
You have the regular stuff
that comes with Ubuntu.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.130
It's recognizing your Wi-Fi,
your OS, graphic card.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.860
Everything.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.800
All the basic things that you
need for a Linux device.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.530
As you can see we have Unity
running and presenting.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.550
And we have also Chrome
on the machine.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.480
IDO GREEN: So now we're running

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.110
Chrome inside ChromeOS.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.780
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.493
IDO GREEN: Nice.

00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:57.730
Nice.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.740
NISSIM BETITO: Few things that
I would recommend you to do

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.390
is, probably play little
bit with Linux.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.830
If you want to try
it just move some

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.740
packages you don't need.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.283
Or maybe just, in the end, take
a flavor that you know

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:14.815
that you can develop on, and
play, as you would use to do

00:08:14.815 --> 00:08:15.920
on a regular laptop.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.820
And again, this is Chromebook.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.100
So it's very simple to go back,
as Ido said, to get out

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.730
from developer mode and
just to get back to

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.980
your original ChromeOS.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.085
And it's so beautiful
that it's fast.

00:08:30.085 --> 00:08:31.010
It's at the press of a button.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.539
And you don't need to do get any
special CD installation or

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.960
any other hardware to just
do these changes.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.400
So as Ido said, it's
three simple steps.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.010
Change to developer mode.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.950
Insert your SD card and
recognize it in your laptop.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.620
I tried at least a few SD
cards and USB dumps.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.110
And ChromeOS and Chromebooks
basically

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.050
recognized all of them.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.160
And just captured the image from
online and just throw it

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.700
on your SD card.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.400
IDO GREEN: Now the good tip here
is to use SD card that

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.670
has at least 8 gig, right.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.980
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.540
IDO GREEN: So it will have
a bit more memory.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.910
And the other thing that you
need to remember is that it's

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.070
all without any warranty.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.470
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.350
IDO GREEN: So you're downloading
scripts from the

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.890
web, put your best judgement
into place and make sure that

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.440
it's not a production laptop.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.010
NISSIM BETITO: Exactly, yeah.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.275
IDO GREEN: Another cool thing
that we'll show you in the

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.820
near future is what you did
with this little guy.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.530
NISSIM BETITO: Yes, we have the
Raspberry Pi here with us.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.720
And then another thing that we
tried also was running just

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.370
ChromeOS on Raspberry Pi.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.960
It's basically ARM based
board that you have an

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.580
HDMI video in it.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.010
And also doing network ports.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.690
You have two USB ports only
and one network port.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.160
You can do anything with it.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:00.630
You can, as we did with the
Chromebook, just pushed an SD

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.030
card with Ubuntu flavor, we
can do the same thing with

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:10.680
Raspberry Pi but just with
ChromeOS on the Raspberry.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.820
It's beautiful.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.210
Again you have the SD slot.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.780
So you can create as few
distribution and as much

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:21.580
distribution that you want
for any kind of software

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.620
development or installation that
you need in your office,

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.620
at home, or whatever
you need to.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.236
And as Ido said, probably if you
want we can talk about it

00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:32.740
a little bit more
in the future.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.540
And even show you
how it's done.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.160
IDO GREEN: Yeah definitely.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.290
And I think that the main
feedback that you gave was

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.640
that it was much slower than the
Chromebook itself, right.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:39.930
NISSIM BETITO: Yes.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.330
IDO GREEN: In terms of
the capabilities.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.090
NISSIM BETITO: [INAUDIBLE]
yes.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.230
IDO GREEN: But yeah, it's very,
very cool and of course,

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.084
much cheaper.

00:10:45.084 --> 00:10:45.940
NISSIM BETITO: Yeah.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.660
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.140
So I think I will wrap
it up for this time.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.580
We are extremely busy and have
lot of surprises for you for

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.330
next week at Google I/O. So for
the ones that aren't going

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.140
to be live there, just feel
free to watch the live

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.226
Hangouts, and the broadcast
that we'll of course have,

00:11:04.226 --> 00:11:06.040
like we do every year.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.150
And until two weeks' time,
because next week we aren't

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.560
going to have our weekly show,
be strong and safe.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.370
Thank you.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.970
NISSIM BETITO: Bye guys.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.220
IDO GREEN: Bye-bye.
