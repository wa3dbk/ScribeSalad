JENNY MURPHY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.230
Welcome to this week's episode,
or session, I guess,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.830
of the Google+ Platform
Office Hours.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.960
This week we're going to be
talking about snippets.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.540
a lot about snippets.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.770
How you can use them, what you
can use them to do, and other

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.710
cool tools and stuff.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.750
Joining me is Gus.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.950
GUS: I'm Gus, and this is my
first time on Office Hours.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.530
And I'm pretty new to
the Google+ team

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.010
as a developer advocate.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.782
And I'll just be trying to
help Jenny out today.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.960
JENNY MURPHY: And I'm Jenny,
Jenny Murphy, developer,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.800
programs engineer, on the
Google+ platform.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.590
So I spend a lot of time out
there on the Plus page and the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.250
forums helping you guys build
awesome stuff, and snippets

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.070
are a part of that.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.830
So we're going to be talking
about those today.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.530
And just one quick note about
our Office Hours, we do love

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.000
getting feature requests
from you guys.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
So feel free to send those
in and ask us.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.080
But in general, we don't
make comments about

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.770
forward-looking things.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.120
So although we'll definitely
take your feedback and note

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.940
it, there's just not a lot we
can tell you, especially about

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.450
release dates and that
kind of stuff.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
But don't let that stop you from
asking us fun questions.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.290
Great.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.025
So I guess we should dig
into the snippets.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.250
GUS: So as someone who's
actually relatively new to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.490
snippets Just getting started,
I kind of would wonder, what

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.361
exactly is a snippet?

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:28.850
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.860
So a snippet is--

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
well actually, why would I tell
you, when I can show you?

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.550
So let me bring up a quick,
cool, demo of what a snippet

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.040
is, and what it allows
you to do.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.160
So here we have a snippet
in action.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.090
So a snippet is a way for you
as a publisher to control.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.840
So here we have a snippet of
one of my example sites,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.720
Baking Disasters, as
it appears in a

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.520
Google web search result.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.449
And you can see that there's an
image specified, a title,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.720
and a description.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.900
But snippets show up in
a lot of other places.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.860
Let's take a look at
the page itself.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.610
We can see that the snippet is
also used in the share box

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.310
when I share the post
on Google+.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.730
Just pull it up here,
and we can see it.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.240
Let's share that.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.930
So if I jump on over to Google+
and reload the page--

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.190
the wrong key.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.140
Reload with the reload button.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.680
We can see that the
same snippet

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380
has shown up on Google+.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.730
So snippets are a tool for you
as a content publisher to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.940
control what shows up
all over the place.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.400
And snippets aren't just
used at Google.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.050
If you mark up your content
in the right way, the same

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.670
snippet will show up in all
sorts of different places,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.662
including the three top
major search engines.

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:10.695
GUS: So now that we know kind
of what a snippet is

00:03:10.695 --> 00:03:11.945
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.262
a developer care?

00:03:21.262 --> 00:03:22.220
JENNY MURPHY: Why would
a developer

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.050
care about a snippet?

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.240
Well if you don't specify a
snippet on your website,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.550
the controls that you
have in here.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.250
We know that you're always going
to tell us what's really

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.850
important about your content,
and snippets are how we give

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.220
you that control, and how
you can specify that

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.990
for the whole world.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.240
GUS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.740
some information about
specifically what that crawler

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.520
is looking that.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.150
JENNY MURPHY: Exactly.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.700
GUS: OK, so then how
do we use them?

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.886
How do we get this snippet
functionality to work inside

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:27.342
of our sites?

00:04:27.342 --> 00:04:29.890
JENNY MURPHY: Cool, let's
take a look at that.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.440
We have a lot of cool tools.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.580
Let me switch windows, so I can
show you something neat.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.840
Here we go.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.920
OK, how do you get snippets
into your site?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.250
There are a lot of different
ways to control your snippet.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.830
There's a lot of different
ways to specify

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.670
the structured markup.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.950
We have a favorite, we have one
that we like a lot called

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.330
schema.org.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.690
Schema.org markup is an open
standard way of marking up the

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.760
content that you're publishing,
and it has some

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.500
benefit over other techniques.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.970
Schema.org markup is added to
the content of your site,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.510
instead of adding new content.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.670
So you're just marking up
content that's already there,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.540
which saves you a lot of effort
because you don't have

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.250
to add anything new.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.030
It's also an extremely
expressive way of specifying

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.760
on the structure of your page.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.390
It's not just about a few fields
up top, although there

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.220
are a few important ones.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.600
It's a way of specifying the
content of your page for a

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.670
whole bunch of different
kinds of schemas.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.620
Everything from recipes, like
the one I showed you earlier

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.020
for the macaron on Baking
Disasters to locations.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.540
And even get as specific as my
favorite schema, there's

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.590
actually a schema.org schema
for structured markup of

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.980
volcanoes, which is
pretty awesome.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.130
But anyway, let me show you some
tools that you can use to

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.665
get some snippets onto
your content.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.010
So flip it over here.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.340
You can see we have a little
snippet code generator that

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.440
will show you some skeleton code
for adding snippets to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.770
your content.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.530
It's on
developers.google.com/plus.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.690
Once you go there, you can click
around and find it on

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.483
under Plug-ins, Snippet, or I'll
be adding a link to it in

00:06:21.483 --> 00:06:24.400
the show notes.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.950
So once you get to this page,
the first thing you're going

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.620
to do is you're going to tell
us what kind of content your

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.580
page has on it.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.400
And we've chosen a few really
common schemas, but you can

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.550
specify your own in the other
field if you want.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.890
But let's stick to a
simple one for now.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.740
Local business.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.250
So let's say I'm marking up my
local business for Baking

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.120
Disasters which is, I guess,
going into business.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.930
It's not just for example
code anymore.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.080
And let's get an image URL, I
don't actually have one handy,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.340
so I'll use my favorite example
site for links that I

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.330
know won't collide with
anyone, example.com.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.410
And this would just be the image
that you want to appear

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.450
in the search result, and as
well as wherever else the

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.700
snippet will show up.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.070
So in addition to the title
image, you can also specify a

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.590
description.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.550
In this exercise I'm just
typing it in, but you'll

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.120
probably have content that
correlates to the description

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.600
on the page itself, usually
an intro paragraph, or

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.560
something like that.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.260
When baking goes all wrong.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:42.030
GUS: So something I noticed,
Jenny, in the image URL you

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:46.120
used a site that's external
to bakingdisasters.com.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.480
Is that perfectly acceptable
along the way, or is it sort

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.580
of a best practice to stick
to the stuff that's

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:53.520
within you're own site?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.110
JENNY MURPHY: So there are
always going to be cases where

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.360
your image [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:04.707 --> 00:08:06.300
structure and especially
to a lot of you

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.770
publishers out there.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:13.150
So we allow it, but make sure
this is your image.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.585
Make sure that it's something
you control.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.000
Posting it from a domain you
control's important.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.965
So I'm demoing a bad
practice here.

00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:23.300
GUS: The last thing you'd want
to happen is for your images

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.900
to get switched in your schema
behind your back.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.942
JENNY MURPHY: That would sure
be a shame, wouldn't it.

00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:30.990
GUS: OK, really good to know,
just something I was thinking.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.186
JENNY MURPHY: Good question.

00:08:32.186 --> 00:08:34.322
GUS: Cool.

00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:35.929
JENNY MURPHY: So let's see
what we have here.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.250
So what's happening here is as
I'm filling out these fields,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.350
there's some example schema.org
mark up showing up

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.039
in the little pane on
the right side.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.830
And this is a very simple
example of how to do a

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.370
schema.org markup to
get you started.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.740
In this case, we're adding an
items scope to the HTML

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.180
element of the page, and this
is where we tell whatever's

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.300
parsing that structured markup
what kind of content we're

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.910
marking up.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.850
And then we've filled out a few
fields here below which

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.180
correlate to those text boxes
that I typed stuff into just a

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.280
moment ago.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.100
There's the name, there's the
image, and there's the

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.350
description.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.840
And this is the basic amount of
markup that you need to get

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.100
control over just changing
the image, the title, the

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.910
description and Google+,
Google web search, and

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.628
everywhere else is processing
this markup.

00:09:28.628 --> 00:09:30.940
Yep.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.320
But you can go a lot
deeper than that.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.580
So let's dive into schema.org
a little further.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.410
I showed you a few schema
types here, but there's

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.520
actually a whole bunch
more available.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.150
If you just go to aptly-named
schema.org, you can find a

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.230
whole hierarchy of different
schemas.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.220
Whenever you use a specific
schema you can also use any of

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.120
the different subtypes that
are under it in the tree.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.400
So, let me zoom into
this a little bit.

00:09:59.787 --> 00:10:02.070
I do not know what I did.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.920
Let me escape out of here.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.950
I've gotten into an
accessibility mode that I'm

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:05.790
not familiar with.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.680
GUS: Click on the magnifying
glass.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.630
JENNY MURPHY: On the
magnifying glass?

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.385
GUS: It's in the left
of your screen.

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:11.850
There you go.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.110
JENNY MURPHY: Ah, it's been a
while since I've used this.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.590
GUS: Just hit right there.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.272
JENNY MURPHY: There we go.

00:10:16.272 --> 00:10:17.140
GUS: Close it.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.130
JENNY MURPHY: Close it?

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:18.560
GUS: Save.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.470
JENNY MURPHY: Oh,
thank you Gus.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.720
Saved again.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.940
So here is the schema.org
list of schemas.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.290
Whenever you use a specific
schema-- like we were just

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.540
using local business--

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.840
there's actually a whole
bunch of different

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.350
sub schemas of that.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.490
And you can use that wherever
that would be--

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.020
whatever is most specific
to your content.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.580
There's a whole bunch
of cool ones here.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.480
One of my favorites
is tire shop.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.180
So all you tire shops out there
who have pages, or all

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.680
of you content producers that
have pages that describe tire

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.630
shops, can actually very
specifically describe all the

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.820
metadata specific to your tire
shop, which is pretty cool.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.750
And when we arrive on one of
these schemas, we see there's

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.550
a whole bunch more fields.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.060
There's the fields at the top,
which are pretty much the same

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.220
as the fields that we've filled
out on the tool, but

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.200
there's a whole bunch of other
stuff down here below that

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.680
describes stuff specific
to our schema.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.550
When you're marking up your
content we recommend that in

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.040
addition to the basic fields
that the tool helped you get

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.310
started with that you mark
up everything that

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.150
you possibly can.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.910
You want to give us as much
detail as possible, because

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.240
we're starting to use
that detail in

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.410
more and more places.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.760
And there's going to be really
cool stuff that results.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.860
So even if you're marking up a
volcano, and volcano is not a

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.850
schema that we do a whole lot
with right now, someday, once

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.120
we have volcano aware software,
we might be doing

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.110
some really cool stuff with
that particular markup.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.360
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:58.954 --> 00:12:03.960
GUS: --volcanoes everywhere and
do whatever we need to do

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.175
in our plus apps.

00:12:05.175 --> 00:12:06.790
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, you can
do the best possible

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.940
sharing with them.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.080
There's actually one specific
case where we're starting to

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.100
use a lot of the more advanced
features [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:21.260
GUS: Yay, victory.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.110
JENNY MURPHY: --popularly.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.130
Where am I hiding it?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.440
It's in one of these minimized
Windows, I'll find it.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.450
Let me open another one.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.980
Cool.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.380
OK, it came up.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.390
So here's the Google+ history
beta web interface.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.720
So the Google+ history API, as
you may have heard, or may

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.110
have not heard, just recently
entered developer preview.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:00.820
So it's not out for general
availability yet, but it's a

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.580
great example of us doing
something cool with schema.org

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.830
markup that we weren't
doing before.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.230
It's also an example of where
we're, for the first time,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.760
starting to use a lot of the
other details of the schema

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.260
markup that you apply
to your pages to do

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.060
more expressive stuff.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.810
So when you create a moment
with a history API, that

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.520
doesn't really express it much,
there's a potential for

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.260
cool stuff to happen here
someday, which is always

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.510
pretty awesome.

00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:51.382
GUS: Exciting history stuff.

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:52.990
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.975
GUS: We all look forward to
advancements in history.

00:13:55.975 --> 00:13:57.660
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, it's
an exciting API.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.300
I'm really excited about it.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.690
So let's say you've added a
bunch of schema.org markup to

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.740
your pages, which you were going
to ask me about, but I

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.075
derailed us a little it.

00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:12.236
GUS: So how do we add schema.org
markup to our

00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:13.160
pages, Jenny?

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.850
JENNY MURPHY: Thank you, Gus.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:18.380
So I already talked a little bit
about how we add it with

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.910
those tools.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.720
Once we've added it, how
do we verify that

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.970
it's actually working?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.520
So let's take a trip back to
the Baking Disasters page.

00:14:32.448 --> 00:14:33.540
GUS: This says macaron.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:39.354
I thought it was macaroon, as
opposed to one or the other.

00:14:39.354 --> 00:14:41.580
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, I was
actually calling this macaroon

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.210
until I went to the party where
we baked it, and I was

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.530
fortunate enough that a
professional pastry chef

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.330
joined us, who was very helpful
until he got a little

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.230
distracted by beer,
and was unable to

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.640
help us with our macaroons.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.400
One of the reasons it became
a baking disaster.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.989
Macaron is apparently a more
specific kind [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:08.555 --> 00:15:09.130
GUS: --baking disaster
that would create.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:10.500
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah,
I kind of had some

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.925
potential for exploding.

00:15:12.925 --> 00:15:15.020
You can read more on
Baking Disasters.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.390
Anyway, I've added a
bunch of schema.org

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.690
markup to this site.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.780
As I showed you before, if we
want to validate that the

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.090
schema.org markup works, the
easiest and most obvious way

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.480
is you just go and you hit the
button, and you verify that

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.170
the snippet looks correct.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.980
But this only allows you to
verify some of the markup.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.490
We have some more advanced tools
that are pretty cool.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.260
We have the rich snippet
testing tool.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.710
This one's been around
for quite a while.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.830
But it still works, and
it's still great.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.270
So let me copy the URL.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.090
And we can go to this tool,
paste in our URL, or you can

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.960
paste in the HTML content, if,
for example, you have a page

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.820
that's behind a firewall
right now.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.780
And you can get a report, you
can get a preview of the

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.360
snippet as it will appear in
your Google web search result.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.720
And you get a really detailed
breakdown of all the kind of

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.780
content we've pulled
out of there.

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.870
So in cases where we may opt
to pick one kind of markup

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.860
over another, this tool allows
you to see all of it, kind of

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.800
like a neat [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.770
So it's a great place
to start, but it can

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.490
kind of be a hassle.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.630
So one of the developers on our
team created a new tool.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.650
He made a Chrome extension
that does a

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.380
lot of the same stuff.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.350
It's called--

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.070
what is it called?

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.890
Beta markup, or--

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:29.650
I can't quite see it.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:34.140
But I'll be mentioning it in
the show notes, micro beta.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:35.070
GUS: Micro beta.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.070
JENNY MURPHY: Yes, and what
it does is whenever you're

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.130
visiting a page you can hit a
button, and you can see an

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.250
output of all the schema.org
markup on that page.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.400
So it's a great way, when
surfing around on your site,

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.610
to validate the markup is all
happy and presenting the way

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.860
you want it to.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.980
Cool.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.360
GUS: I don't have that many
more questions, actually.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.050
You've answered a lot of the
initial reservations and

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.465
interest that I had
around schema.

00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:04.950
JENNY MURPHY: So you going to
go schema you're site now?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.200
GUS: I'm going to go
schema my site.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.330
JENNY MURPHY: Or have
you already?

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:08.510
GUS: Maybe I already did.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.470
JENNY MURPHY: Maybe
you already did.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.220
GUS: Poorly.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.564
I need to go back and
do it better.

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:13.610
JENNY MURPHY: What are you
going to do better?

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.640
GUS: I'm going to make sure that
I'm using all the right

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:19.805
types for my posts and other
things that are on my site.

00:17:19.805 --> 00:17:21.770
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:22.369
OK.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:26.270
Well that wraps up our kind
of faux interview here.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:27.890
Thanks Gus.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.560
Now we're going to go and we're
going to answer some of

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.200
the questions, if you've asked
any in the forums.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.780
So let's go take a look on the
Google+ developers' page and

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.455
see what you guys have been
chatting about while we've

00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:38.705
been babbling here.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.240
And I don't really see that many
questions about snippets

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.390
or the Google+ platform.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.870
Just one comment about
cameras and mics.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:54.640
We'll get that worked out.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.050
We're still working
on the studio.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.070
The quality seems a lot better,
but we're still

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.410
working out some kinks.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.420
So bear with us during these few
weeks of Office Hours as

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.810
we get that stuff all smoothed
out from a technical

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.930
perspective.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.060
But it looks like there's not
a lot of conversation about

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.860
snippets out there right now,
so I guess we might as well

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.770
wrap it up.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:14.200
Sound good?

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.515
GUS: Sounds good.

00:18:15.515 --> 00:18:17.450
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:25.390
So just checking for comments
in other places.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.560
Well, thanks for joining
us, everyone.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.100
So what we did in a quick
recap, we talked about

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.110
snippets, what they are, how you
can put them on your site,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:37.460
and what are the cool stuff that
results from you adding

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.370
that markup to your page.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.000
So tune in next week, and we'll
be talking about some

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.260
other developer topics.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.960
You'll be able to find our
sessions announced on the

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.290
Google+ developers' page a few
days before each session with

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.940
the detail topic.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.570
And you can also go to Google
Developers Live, and you can

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.590
see several of our sessions
that are upcoming and what

00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.080
kind of topics might be
of interest to you.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.500
So I guess that's all
we have for today.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.670
GUS: That's all we've got.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:03.640
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks everyone.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.890
Goodbye.
