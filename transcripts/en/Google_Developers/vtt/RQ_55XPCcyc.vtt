IDO GREEN: Hello, and welcome to
another episode of GDL-IL,

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.470
GDL-Israel.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.850
Today, we're going to speak
about NodeJS and Chrome, and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.550
how you could leverage the
powerful DevTools that we have

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.800
today and Chrome and Chromium
in order to debug NodeJS

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.180
applications.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.080
Now, it's true that you could
debug your NodeJS with

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.080
WebStorm, there are some other
options out there.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.750
But I really like to focus on
Chrome and the open-source

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.920
project Chromium, because not
only it's giving you the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.450
ability to it without any money,
which is nice, it's

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.200
actually a quite efficient way
to get insight of what your

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.540
application is doing and be more
productive when you are

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.220
building larger and larger
applications.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.769
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen with you.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.470
And we'll do it quite
quickly today.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.410
So we'll start, and actually,
I'll put all those links in

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.200
show footnotes.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.240
It's a blog post that I wrote
and published yesterday.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.370
And basically, we
see that today--

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.480
and I see it more and
more in Node--

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.720
you're starting with a small
script, and then quite

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020
quickly, you're getting to a
larger, larger app that you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.220
want to get insight and see how
productive you could fix

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.090
things and understand what is
going on behind the scenes.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.710
When we we're going to use it
today, we're go, basically, to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.220
get what Blink is giving us,
so the DevTools that are

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.690
sitting inside it.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.560
And you'll see that they are
quite similar to the DevTools

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.240
that we get in Chrome itself.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.440
So if I open them quite quickly,
as you saw here,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.580
we're getting quite a lot of
tabs over here at the top.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.030
In our case, when we're going
to debug NodeJS, we only get

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.900
to the source stub and
the console one.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.610
And I'll show you in a minute
what does it mean.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.720
And let me just make
it even larger.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.250
So the first step, in order to
install it, is of course,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.570
first and foremost,
we install Node.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.740
And after you install Node,
you'll just run this command

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.960
of installing the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.850
node-inspector, which is a model.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.910
Luckily for us, npm, the ability
to manage models

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.060
inside Node is already coming
when you're installing Node.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.930
So if we just come here and make
this one a bit bigger,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.350
what you could see here
is that I'm just

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.390
going to install it.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.560
And I could see here that it
quite quickly will let me know

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.880
that I already have it.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.860
I need just to do
it with a sudo.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:10.590
And since I already have it,
again, hopefully this time it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.006
will run without any problem.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.970
Of course.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.220
I wrote it with a mistake.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.480
Let's take it again,
hopefully this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.730
time without any mistakes.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.550
And hopefully when you're typing
it without mistakes

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.490
like what I did, it will run
fluently and much quickly.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.680
After installing this model,
and we have the ability, we

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.690
need, basically, just to attach
it to the script that

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.020
we are going to work on.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.000
So here it's just fetching
a bunch of stuff.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.810
And at the end of the day, we
just have this ability.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.630
Now if we'll go and, let's
say, run a specific Node

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.440
script, like in this case, it's
a Monte Carlo simulation

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.550
that I showed you four weeks
ago-- and again, I'll put a

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.100
link to it so if you want to
see how to run Monte Carlo

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.560
simulations inside NodeJS,
you'd be able to do so.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.790
Actually, in that episode, in
the last episode, we did it

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.550
inside Google Cloud, basically,
Compute Engine.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.660
And it's a quite powerful tool
to run NodeJS applications.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.740
Here, the only main difference,
as you can see, is

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.150
just putting this dash,
dash debug break.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.220
So our script will just stop
at the first line.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.980
And when I'm doing it, I'm
getting now the response of,

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.010
OK, the debugger now is
listening on port 58.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.080
Here, you could see here that
I already started the

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.050
node-inspector.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.920
So I'm getting the ability to
just go and [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.860
copy this dislocation.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.730
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.760
just another Chrome tab
we could pass it,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.550
just refresh the page.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.200
And now what's happening behind
the scene is that it's

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.390
connecting to our script.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.836
And when we just let it run,
right now it's detached.

00:05:26.836 --> 00:05:28.086
But if I try it again--

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090
Yeah, it's not working.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.850
Let's try it again.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.380
We're running it.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.050
And now let's try to call it.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.230
We'll just have the running
script in the background.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.100
But now that we do have it, if
we'll just run, you could see

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.330
immediately see that
it's going.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.880
It's connecting to it.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.980
And I have it with a breakpoint
at the beginning.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.920
What they could do is
go in and do much

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.020
more interesting stuff.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.080
It's just going to my code.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.300
And let's say that I'm putting a
breakpoint at the beginning.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.230
And now I'm just running
to do is breakpoints.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.370
Some powerful things could
be achieved here.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.710
So first, I just could inspect
what's going on with each and

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.720
every variable.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.710
And as you could see here,
it's undefined.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.530
But after I'm passing it, I
see exactly what is the

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.020
variable that I got here.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.370
That's quite trivial.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.320
I could do more sophisticated
stuff, as you all know, just

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.440
setting out a breakpoint, and
running to it quite quickly.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.210
And then, of course, I could
dive into the function itself,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.100
run scenario blending.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.030
But if I just want to see what's
going on after the

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.480
function has returned, I could
now go to the expression

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.350
itself, see that
it's containing

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.820
some interesting values.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.770
I could do local modification.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.330
I could get edit to the watch.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.060
And as you can see here, now
I have it permanently.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.220
So I could do some nice things
[INAUDIBLE] see exactly what's

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.630
going on here.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.505
I could also, of course,
click Escape and get

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:12.940
in the console here.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.660
And in the console, the great
benefits that you already have

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.680
in Node, like doing nice things
like autocompletes on

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.450
the variables that you have in
your scripts, and then diving

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.220
into a certain object to see
what's going on there, and

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.590
lots of other things,
of course.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.590
You have the call stack, so you
could see exactly what's

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.560
going on and how the application
path, in terms of

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.380
the function calls went.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.950
And the scope, of course, of the
variables, what's going on

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.800
in each and every one of them.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.960
And, of course, breakpoints.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.790
So if you want to see where
you set the breakpoints.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.880
In our case, it was at the
beginning of the script, and

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.720
then a bit later on.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.110
And lots of others
possibilities.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.690
Of course, when you are just
releasing the lock of the

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:04.890
breakpoints, and you could see
here in this window that the

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:06.900
script will continue to run.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.490
And let me try to adjust that.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.570
So of course, since we are
breaking a point inside

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.650
function, that's inside a loop,
we continue to do so.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.110
But now that I removed it, and
I could move this one, as

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.280
well, I could just run it.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.210
And as you can see here, quite
nicely, it's all running in

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:24.890
the background.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:31.480
We actually ran 10,000
trials, and got the

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.919
response quite quickly.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.360
Actually it took us this amount
of time because we

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.870
showed how to do things.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.960
But if we run it without
breaking, to just let me show

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.600
you the powerful node, in terms
of performance, how

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.350
quickly doing things.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.890
So we got 10,000 trials
in 357 milliseconds,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.350
which is quite nice.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.340
So that's basically
what we got.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.300
The node-inspector's giving
you the powerful DevTools

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.310
under your arm when you're going
and want to check and

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.780
verify and debug your scripts.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.860
Hopefully in the near future,
we'll have here other

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.250
thoughts, like the profiler, the
audit, and more and more.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:20.700
And all the links for how to do
it and what are the steps,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.400
as you can see here, will be

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.520
published in the show footnotes.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.190
So feel free to just go and
try it on yourselves.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.190
If you want to have questions or
comments, please feel free

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.440
to reach out to me on greenido
at Twitter or greenido in G+.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.870
So until next time, thank you
very much and be strong.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.190
Thank you.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.440
Bye bye.
