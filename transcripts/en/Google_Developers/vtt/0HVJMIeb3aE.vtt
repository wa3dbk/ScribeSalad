ARUN NAGARAJAN: Hello,
everybody.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.280
My name is Arun Nagarajan, and
I'm with the Google Apps

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.420
Script Team.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.470
JOHN MCGOWAN: My name is John
McGowan, and I'm a developer

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.700
on Google Drive.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Excellent.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.900
This session is Integrate
Google Drive

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.580
with Google Apps Script.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.480
And we're really excited for
all of you to be here.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.940
Google Drive is a storage and
collaboration platform with

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.660
millions of users with
billions of files.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.630
In this session, you will
learn how to write

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.690
applications that provide
value to those users.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.230
There are many ways to write
these applications, but today

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.040
we're going to focus on an
exciting platform called

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.920
Google Apps Script, which we
think is really an easy way to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.380
get started, but also a powerful
way to deliver value

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.870
to these users.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.960
And we're going to tell you this
story by focusing on two

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.690
integration scenarios.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
The first one is having your
application available to the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.600
user in the interface that
they're already used to--

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.916
drive.google.com.

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:50.510
Real easy to remember, probably
the home page for a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.410
lot of folks that are living
in Google Drive.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.240
This means being available in
the Create menu, and also in

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.320
the Open option for
a selected file.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.730
And then the second part, which
really goes well with

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.140
the newly released service, is
the ability to access those

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.740
billions of files from
Google Apps Script.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.850
So being able to access those
files-- write files, changing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.840
permissions--

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.890
as the user from Google
Apps Script.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.980
So those are the two things
we're going to show you.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.290
But we think it's really
important to show you this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.350
with a live demo.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.520
So we're going to start off by
showing off a demo, and then

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.040
come back and deconstruct what
we did in a nice flow.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.770
Yesterday at the keynote, you
heard our leaders tell you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.820
that we have 25 million users
in the education space.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.990
It's a really important
segment for us.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.900
It's something that these users
are finding a lot of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300
value in already.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.910
In the demo today, we're going
to-- we made up an application

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.550
called Quiz Manager.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.970
And the idea is to provide a
little utility to teachers to

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.100
allow them to take what usually
is a roster in a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.230
spreadsheet, and then being
able to turn that into

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.590
assigned assignments through a
Drive document, or a Google

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.450
Document, I should say.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.870
Now that's what we
want to show you.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.450
That's the demo we're
going to build you.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.630
Some of the requirements that
you should keep in mind as

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.760
we're showing you this is that
it should be the whole life

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.220
cycle of the quiz that
we want to manage.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.400
Being able to start from the
roster all the way to then

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.150
completing the quiz.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.290
We want it to be supportive
of multiple file creation.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.190
So one of the more painful
things sometimes is copying a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.120
file 15 times, renaming it
appropriately, and sharing it

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.150
with the right people.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210
So we want to take that human
error and pain out of the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.980
picture, and have it facilitate
the creation of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.490
multiple files.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.630
And we want it to be completely
integrated with the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.630
Drive interface.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.880
So the application itself has
very little UI by itself.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.470
You work with it in Drive.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.600
And we want to be built with
the easy-to-use platform

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.750
that's easy to tweak, upgrade
to what the new requirements

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.860
might be, and run
on the cloud.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.720
So I don't have to, as a teacher
a an administrative

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.160
person at the school,
manage a lot of

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.020
different systems, right?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.190
So let's go take a look.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.460
All the code is available on
our system, on GitHub.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.250
So don't have to worry about
getting access to the code.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.790
So I'm going to switch over
to the demo laptop.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.520
So here is Google Drive.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.680
Everybody's very familiar
with this.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.500
So like any good teacher,
there's a lot of different

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.050
applications that this teacher's
already installed.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.670
What we want to do with this is
install a new application

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.140
into this and then be able to
do some interesting things

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.390
with the files in
Drive itself.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.650
So now I'm going to assume the
role of that teacher, and I'll

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.630
play along as the teacher.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.630
So the teacher recently got an
email saying, there's an

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.780
awesome new application that
you can install into your

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.700
Google Drive.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.230
And it's really easy to install
and really easy to get

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.665
started, and it'll help me
with my quiz management.

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:45.490
So I'm going to click on the
link to get started.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.940
It's going to show me a simple
welcome screen to install the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.700
application.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.380
I go ahead and install it--

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.310
a very standard, trusted screen
that tells me that this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.080
is from Google, do you want to
install this application into

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.620
your Drive?

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.770
This one, this user's Drive
Create Assignment, and that

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.960
allows me to trust
that screen.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.120
I've installed it.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.780
Let me close that, go
back into Drive.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.510
Refresh my Drive window.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.600
And now we have a new option
available called Create

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.360
Assignment.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.320
So it makes sense, as well, from
a teacher's perspective

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.640
on what it does.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.480
So I'm going to say, let's
go ahead and create an

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.820
assignment.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.840
So what's happening now is
that this application is

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.400
working against the user's
Drive and creating the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.630
documents and the folder
structure necessary for the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.490
document to exist.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.290
So I'm going to hit
Close here.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.040
Go back to my drive, and now I
have a new folder called New

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.370
Assignment.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.070
I'll go within it, and I see
that there is now a couple of

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.490
files here of interest.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.490
There is a roster, and
there's also a

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.790
template for quiz questions.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.450
OK?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.420
In order to facilitate the demo,
I've just kind of saved

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.450
a sample roster.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.090
I'm going to copy and
paste that in.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.860
And we've also come up with a
quiz we think is a really good

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.590
quiz to give to high
school students.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.070
It's a standard Google
quiz, I think.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.520
All right.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.550
So what I have now is a
quiz, a roster, and I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.270
think I'm good to go.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.450
So now what I'll do is I'll
come here, and I'll hit

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.970
Publish Quiz.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.870
And that's going to spin.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.670
And in the meantime, I'm going
to switch over here.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.080
On the right side of my screen,
I am now a student.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.930
So that's my second persona.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.630
And what's going to happen is
a new file just popped into

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.460
Jane's Drive.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.810
She didn't have to go and
refresh anything.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.480
This is the always online
collaborative aspect of Google

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.190
Drive coming into play.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.110
And as far as the teacher's
concerned, the application's

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.880
finished for him or her.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.040
And now there's a bunch more
files for the teacher to grade

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.970
and look at.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.430
So let's go back to
being a student.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.100
I am Jane.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.490
I've come back in.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.340
And OK, the first question
I know the answer to.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.490
The next question
I think is 9.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.740
This one--

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.050
that's kind of beyond me, so
I'm going to slack off, and

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.410
let's say that I'm just going
to go to a movie and

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.630
not solve this quiz.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.760
In the meantime, the deadline
has passed.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.410
The teacher decides now
to close the quiz.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.780
No longer can you add
more content to it.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.510
It's sort of like pencils
down, right?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.130
That's what that button does.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.560
And that's going to now spin,
and it's going to finish.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.690
And the quiz is now closed,
according to the quiz manager.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.420
Let's say Jane comes back, and
she's feeling all wise, and

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.250
she says, I don't know,
this is tricky.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.310
And she tries to answer
the question anyway.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.980
Google Drive--

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.310
Google Docs is going
to try to save it.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.670
It's going to do its best to
save what it thinks it can

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.790
save automatically, but then
it realizes that the

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.160
permissions have been taken
away from the quiz.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.200
So it's no longer a quiz where
the student can work on.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.680
All she can do now is reload
this page, which will bring

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.210
her into her last save point.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.350
So she at least got two
questions, and it's now in

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.150
View Only mode, right?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.950
So now at this point, she can
look at the comments and the

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.350
grades that the teacher's
providing, but she can no

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.340
longer enter any content
into the quiz.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.460
So that's what the whole
workflow is all about--

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.840
being able to start something,
and then as a student take the

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.240
quiz, and then come back in.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.660
So all that code is available.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.020
And what we're going to do now
is deconstruct what we just

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:30.820
showed you.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.350
So what did we show you here?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.490
So we were able to take a
classroom example of being

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.200
able to take a roster and
convert that into a set of

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.690
assigned documents
for the quiz.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.130
We were able to work within the
Google Drive UI, as well.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.370
So we were able to meet
that requirement.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.280
And it was one click to publish
that assignment.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.540
So we were able to take the
roster and the template that

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.920
was already there and then
assign that to the right

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.410
people with the right privileges
at the right time,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.270
and then flip that back
and take it away.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.800
And you'll also notice that I
actually used files in the

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.520
folder itself to act like
command runners.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.240
So when I clicked on it, it knew
the context of where it

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.550
was and what it meant,
and operated on the

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.890
files in that folder.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.970
So that's a little trick that
allows you to have little

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.260
executable-like links from
within a folder and do some

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.330
interesting things.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.880
And you'll also notice that it
was the default action for

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.430
when I clicked on it, so
the default MIME type

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:27.630
associated with it.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.010
Now there's a lot of
improvement ideas

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.760
here for the viewers.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.929
We wanted to make sure that you
knew what else could be

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:33.440
done with this.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.230
This is by no means a
finished product.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.909
It's really a set of
principles that we

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.000
wanted to show you.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.320
There's a lot of ways you
could monitor progress.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.020
You could ask--

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.530
you could write a little
application to see when the

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.610
deadline's coming up and
alert the students.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:48.730
Close the assignments

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.560
automatically on a timed trigger.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.800
These are things that are
possible in Apps Script.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.510
And also, having a nice
assignment dashboard.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.160
When is the student actually
working on it?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.910
Has she not even opened
the document?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.520
Things like that.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.320
So you're able to get history
and things like that from the

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.740
Drive service, which
is pretty useful.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.620
The Drive API, I should say.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.780
So now, that was the demo to
kind of show you what's

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.870
possible in the Google
Apps Script plus

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.020
Google Drive world.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.690
Now let's take you through how
we built it and what some of

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:21.550
the technical salient points are
for this particular demo.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:23.490
So we're going to show you
this in two parts.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.140
So first, I'm going to quickly
introduce Google Apps Script.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.250
And then, John's going to give
you more of the detailed

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.610
deep-dive on what we did
in Apps Script itself.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.160
Then I'll talk about what was
really important in the

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.420
Google Drive SDK.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.730
And then we'll bring it all
together at the end.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.530
So the important thing about
Google Apps Script, I think,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:45.150
that's really exciting to show
off is the fact that it is a

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.880
cloud-based JavaScript platform
that allows you to do

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.220
more with Google.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.100
It allows you to take apps that
you already love, like

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.110
Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sites, and
then automate, integrate, and

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.150
extend those applications.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.760
And you can do that beyond just
the Google APIs, as well.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.940
We have the ability to call
external services, as well.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.330
So I think that's really
important.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.540
And the best part of it is that
you're able to write the

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.960
code in a browser.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.510
So that's an actual screenshot
of the browser with a script

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.960
editor loaded up.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.386
The URL is script.google.com.

00:10:18.386 --> 00:10:20.170
You can try it on your Pixels.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.580
It's really easy to remember,
really easy to get to.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.170
And that actually in there is
a working example of an app

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.460
that could archive
a Gmail inbox.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.960
There's no limits--

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.320
it's not limited to the first
hundred, or something like

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.790
that, so that will probably
time out in a large inbox.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.810
But the idea is that it's really
easy to write this

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.260
JavaScript, and there are things
like auto-complete that

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.570
make you even more productive
and comfortable within this

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.250
environment.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.150
The important thing that made
this all possible is the fact

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.330
that Google Apps Script apps
can be deployed as web

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.440
applications.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.580
So that's the screenshot of
what the deployment screen

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.270
looks like.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.900
That was announced last I/O, so
it's really exciting for us

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.460
to use this for some interesting
capabilities.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.090
And what you essentially end up
doing is expose these web

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:04.490
endpoints for your
business logic.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.900
And the business logic is what
John's going to talk about--

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.860
how we were able to take the
calls, and perform operations

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.400
on the user's Drive.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.880
We were able to also run the
application to execute as the

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.380
user, rather than the developer
that wrote it.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.110
That's really important, because
we're trying to save

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.830
to the user's Drive, not
the developer's Drive.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.120
So that authorization part is
really taken care of for you.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.500
And you're able to-- if you have
Google Apps for Education

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.880
or Google Apps for Business,
you can restrict the

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.360
application to be only available
to people within

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.570
your organization.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.780
So that's actually a really nice
feature of Google Apps

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.620
Script to restrict that
access pretty easily.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.220
And from a developer standpoint,
all you need to do

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.290
is implement a method called
doGet, which is very familiar

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.120
for folks that have done Java
servlet programming, to

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.770
execute the logic that you need,
receive the context that

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.430
you need, and then return the
HTML, or any content you want

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.550
to return back.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.200
Really straightforward
to do this.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.690
So now let's step back
and look at the

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.090
Drive SDK bits of this.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.860
The Google Drive SDK allows you
to integrate deeply within

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:08.740
the Google Drive UI.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.640
So it allows you to show your
application within the Create

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.990
menu and the Open option.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.960
You do that by defining
the metadata in

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.330
the Developer Console.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.730
So that's a one-time option,
a process that's a bit of a

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.470
different console than you're
normally used to.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.760
It's
developers.google.com/console.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.750
Real easy to find once
you're there.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.696
And then I'll talk you through
what the settings you need to

00:12:30.696 --> 00:12:32.150
set up are.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.890
Then you write the web
application, which we showed

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.870
you, to receive the context
and perform the logic.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.270
And then at the very end of it,
how does the user get your

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:42.280
application?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.700
In our example, we installed
it by visiting a link, by

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.710
requesting the drive.install
OAuth scope.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.720
You can also have your
application available in the

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.290
Chrome Web Store, which
is really great for

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.910
discoverability, reviews,
having more videos and

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.140
screenshots of what your app
does and looks like.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.940
So that's actually really
powerful, as well.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.300
For our demo, it's a lot easier
to just email a link

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.880
and showcase that capability.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.950
But I urge you to submit to
the Chrome Web Store for

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.580
really commonly used
applications.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.620
So what is the lifecycle of
the app that we want to

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.300
demonstrate today?

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.040
It takes the click from the
Drive UI integration point and

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.490
the Create in the Open option,
invokes a web app with a

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.520
parameter called "state." Then
App Script kicks off its

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.590
execution of the business logic,
and then uses the Drive

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:34.480
App API in JavaScript to read
and write to the user's Drive.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:34.990
OK?

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.550
So I'm going to talk about the
top part, and John's going to

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.080
cover the bottom part, which is
the JavaScript API that we

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.970
talked about.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.190
So this kind of explains how
Google Drive SDK and the

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.240
Google Apps Script work
side-by-side.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.380
So let's go a little deeper into
the Drive SDK and talk

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.010
about all the different settings
that are important.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.510
The first thing you need to
do is enable the Drive SDK

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.520
Service in the Developer
Console.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.580
Real easy to find it.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.740
Just look for the Drive icon,
and it's Drive SDK.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.790
Flip it on, and then you'll
have a new panel

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:06.210
on the bottom left.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.790
That has a lot of settings.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.360
It's really powerful in how
well you can brand your

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.310
application for mobile support,
for all the different

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.900
resolutions that we support.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.950
But really, the important ones
that you have to remember to

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.720
deal with are the Open URL.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.680
So your app has to open at least
one type of document.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.400
That's a requirement.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.296
In our example, notice that the
URL is script.google.com,

00:14:31.296 --> 00:14:34.080
because we published
an App Script app.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.760
You can register default MIME
types that your application is

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.590
associated with.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.230
And that's the trick that we
used to have our apps open

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.560
when you click on that icon,
that little floral

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.660
icon that we had.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.940
And you can make up your
own MIME types.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.910
This is something that you're
able to define ad hoc and

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.200
respond to those.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.880
And you can also have the Create
With option available.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.680
So again, notice the URL is
script.google.com, followed by

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.110
your deployed URL.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.180
So that's really important.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.530
So those are three things that
you have to get right.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.870
The others are more about
branding and the images and

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.800
things like that.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.220
So what are the actions
that these URLs

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.670
receive that we showed?

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:14.400
They get URL-encoded
JSON strings.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.320
That's what a state parameter
looks like.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.250
It's actually pretty
self-explanatory to see that

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.320
it's the folder ID, what type
of action it is, and then a

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.690
user identifier.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.330
So in that case, it's saying the
app-- the user requested

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.400
the Create action while
in that folder.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.540
So you can actually get the
context of which folder the

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.490
users is in, so you could do
some nested things, as well,

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.780
if you wanted do.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.280
And then the Open option tells
you, OK, which files did the

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.620
user want to open?

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.450
And you notice that
that's an array.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.970
So if you allow the application
to, it'll let the

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:52.860
user select multiple options,
and then open that.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.430
So in our case, since we're
executing commands, it doesn't

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.700
make sense to have multiple
selected.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.820
So we only have one available.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.390
There's a third type of
parameter called Import, which

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.680
we won't talk about here.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.260
But that allows you to take
pre-defined types and convert

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.130
them, if you wanted, in
your application.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.430
Now let's talk about from
a user standpoint.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.210
This is what the user saw when
they visited the link.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.430
In fact, in this example, I have
a couple of additional

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.670
scopes requested.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.420
But in our example, it's just
add to Google Drive.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.090
Very easy and simple screen that
users are used to from

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.640
installing applications.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.600
And as long the user clicks on
Allow Access, your app is now

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.520
linked to the user's Drive.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.080
Now what's cool about installing
applications to

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.520
Drive is that it's not like your
desktop world or mobile

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.060
world where you're downloading
binaries onto your machine.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.230
You're essentially linking two
web applications together, one

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.960
being the user's Google Drive,
the other being your web

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.810
application.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.260
And Google in the middle
mediating that, and ensuring

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.590
that everything is
done securely and

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.910
appropriately, right?

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.310
So that's really nice in that
you're installing a

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.680
cloud-based application
is really linking

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.770
the domains and whatnot.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.160
And then one nice bonus is that
you can actually have

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.549
your application be
mobile-friendly.

00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:12.020
So if you check that option,
it'll in fact allow the user--

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.520
the teacher, in this case-- to
kick off the Create Assignment

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.280
option from their Android
phone or smartphone.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.760
So they're able to very
easily do this.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.710
It'll have the same parameters
passed in, and then it'll

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.349
actually only work with the
Open option for now.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.430
The Create option is
not supported.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.490
But that's a nice little thing
you should do to your

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.270
applications if you have a
simple enough web app.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.290
So what we just saw so far
is, how do you make your

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.150
application available within
the Google Drive UI?

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.890
What John's going to now do is
talk about how do we take that

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.440
invocation and then do the
business logic behind it to

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.046
create the files.

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:51.470
JOHN MCGOWAN: Thank you, Arun.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.400
So at this point, I want
to do a quick overview.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.700
Arun talked about Drive SDK, and
what it looks like for a

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.260
developer to integrate an
application with the Drive UI.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.930
And also, what it looks like
for a user to install an

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.070
application within
the Drive UI.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.600
I'm going to talk about a new
Drive service that we

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.320
announced this week that really
just integrates with

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.610
the user's files within Drive.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.870
We created a new service for
a variety of reasons.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.670
If you remember, we had a
Docs List API before.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.360
But with the new service, we
built it on top of the Drive

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.790
API that we launched
last year.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.870
And this allowed us to provide
a bunch of new features,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:36.770
including new search
functionality that we couldn't

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.940
provide in the old API.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.460
This allows us to do searches
on the file's metadata and

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.710
MIME types and stuff like that,
rather than just the

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.340
document's content or title.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:55.430
We also thought about how
certain processes was very

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.820
complicated, such as getting a

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.080
collection of files or folders.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.770
So we added iterators in order
to make retrieving collections

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:06.920
of files and folders much
easier to do and

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.710
much simpler to code.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.770
I'll give you guys a code demo
of this later in the

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.730
presentation.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.270
Since we are providing a new
service, we decided to add

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.980
some new features, as well.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.830
One of the top three features
that were requested in the

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:25.250
Docs List API was to change
the ownership

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.840
of a file or a folder.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:28.910
So we've added that into
this new service.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.310
And I'm really excited to see
what you guys are going to be

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.340
doing with this--

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.900
the whole service, in general.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.220
But I'll get into that more.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.840
Also, another feature that we
did, since we were focusing on

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:43.380
sharing already, is we also
added the ability to change

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.770
the default sharing settings
of a document.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.670
So now you can share a document
to an entire domain,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:54.240
or publicly for anyone to view
or edit or comment on.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.130
So what does this look like?

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:02.100
We made it a one-line change to
change the default sharing

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.150
visibility of a file.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.160
So this one line, it
will take the quiz

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.430
template from Arun's demo.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.670
We take the template of the
quiz, and we can share it to

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.750
anyone who has a link so they
can view it, and make a copy

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.810
of it if they wish.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:21.360
So you can do the same thing
through the Drive UI, and it

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.010
takes two parameters.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.540
One is the scope of people
that have access to the

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.590
document, and the other is the
permission that they have.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:34.270
And this is how it relates to
the Google Drive UI, as well.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.190
And again, I spoke about the
iterators in order to make it

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.620
easier to retrieve files
and folders.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.860
Before, you had to deal with
indexing and page tokens.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.500
Now, it only takes a couple
lines of code in order to

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.030
retrieve all the files and
folders of a document.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.660
Or in this case, we're
getting a quiz for a

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.330
student and moving it.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.540
So we just pull it out of all
of the folders that it's

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.860
currently in.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.280
And this is just a
five-line change.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.460
At this point, I'd like to show
you a quick demo of the

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.250
code in action.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.190
And since we're all students
of life, it's going to

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:13.050
continue being a demo of
student versus teacher.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.700
Now I have this code
here, and it's not

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.070
production-level code.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.970
It's just going to be
a quick code demo.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.530
What it's going to do is it's
going to create a folder for a

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.110
student, make a copy of our quiz
template, copy that into

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.260
the folder, and then share
it with our student.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.430
So at the beginning,
it's very simple.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.130
All that we do is we get the
quiz template, and this is the

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.930
same as our old API.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:43.680
And then we share it publicly
for anyone who has a link so

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.930
they can view it, make
a copy of it.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.735
Finally, we make a copy of
it, calling it quiz 2.0.

00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:53.700
You know, everything
online is 2.0.

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:54.950
I heard one giggle.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.800
So we create a folder for
our student, JerryBob.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.910
He was my favorite student.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.990
And at this point, we're going
to take all the parents of our

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.270
quiz so that we can move the
quiz into JerryBob's folder.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:13.390
These four lines will
remove the quiz from

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.860
whatever folder it's in.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.030
When you make a copy of a
document, it defaults in the

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.840
same folder as the original
document.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.340
So we're just trying to move
it out of those folders.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.390
And then this last line
will add the quiz

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.650
to JerryBob's folder.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.440
Finally, we share the folder
with JerryBob.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.340
And it will propagate down to
any documents within the

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.390
folder, so JerryBob will have
edit access for the folder,

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.520
and the files within it.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.690
And in order to prevent
cheating--

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.220
because JerryBob likes to talk
with Jimmy, sits right next to

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:46.810
him in class.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.120
Anyways, we make sure that he's
not able to share the

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.250
document, as well.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.500
This is a new function that
we've also added.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.640
So--

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.050
oops.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.590
Actually, I wanted
to run that.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.370
So I'm going to go ahead and
run this so you can see the

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.845
files that it creates.

00:23:05.845 --> 00:23:08.110
And obviously, it's running
in the bar up here.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.320
I didn't install this app.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.460
I'm just running it within
the script as a demo.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.710
Obviously, you can create
an application that does

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.730
all this for you.

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:19.520
So we have our assignment
templates over here, and you

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.740
can see the quiz template
is shared with

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.200
anyone who has the link.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.600
And they can view it,
just as we wanted.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.380
And then here's JerryBob's
folder, which is shared.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.100
And I'm going to go in and
show you that quiz 2.0 is

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.760
shared with JerryBob.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.420
So here he is.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.330
He can edit.

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:43.750
And also, only the owner can
change the permissions.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:45.000
Great.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:53.090
Moving on, I mentioned that we
have more complicated search

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.490
functionality.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.590
Before, you could only search on
title, or what the contents

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.340
of a document, or some
high-level searches.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.540
But now we've add-- since we're
built on top of the

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.920
Drive API, we get all
that feature.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.230
So you can now search on
the file's metadata.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.540
You can search for
the date the file

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.280
was created or modified.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.830
And also, get a collection of
all the files a specific user

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.670
has access to.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.850
Obviously, you can also combine
these together to get

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.290
very granular searches and get
just the files you want.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.050
There are few things to note
with the new service.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.680
One of the things is we no
longer expose email addresses.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.110
This is due to privacy
concerns.

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.320
You can still add editors and
viewers to documents using

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.290
their email address, and you
can also get what kind of

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.260
access a specific user has
to documents, as well.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.470
And once again, since this was
built on the Drive API, we are

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.810
able to offer a bunch of other
features that we didn't have

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.860
time to talk about in our
presentation today.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.350
But we also--

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.840
because it's also built on
Google Apps Script, we were

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.370
able to take care of all the
authorization flows for you,

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.900
as Arun demoed earlier.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.280
And it's all built into the
cloud, so you can code on it

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.740
wherever you want.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.330
With our new Pixel you can do
this out in the grass, get

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.010
yourself a tan.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.370
One thing to point out is
Arun's demo was actually

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.300
originally written with
the old Docs List API.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.090
And it's actually really easy to
migrate from the old API to

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.330
the new Drive service,
as well.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.575
I went and migrated it over out
in the sun, and as you can

00:25:26.575 --> 00:25:28.160
tell, I didn't get
a very good tan.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.470
So, it was a little too easy,
but we're really excited to

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:37.440
see what you guys are going to
do with the new Drive SDK and

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.600
Google Apps Script, and
this new service,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.720
and putting it together.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.870
So hopefully you guys can go out
and get a tan, as well, as

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.140
you build some pretty
cool apps.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.390
We look forward to hearing what
feedback you guys have on

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.900
this presentation.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.540
But at this point, we are open
to taking your questions.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.190
We have two microphones
in the center here.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.330
Once again, this is Arun.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.002
My name's John.

00:25:58.002 --> 00:26:06.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.240
On the transfer ownership of the
documents, is there a way

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.110
to transfer ownership to public
Gmail accounts and

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:20.740
import documents from a
public Gmail account?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.840
JOHN MCGOWAN: It will follow the
sharing permissions that

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.410
you can do through the UI.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.300
So if you can do it through the
Drive UI, you can also do

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.080
it through the new Drive
service, as well.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.400
ARUN NAGARAJAN: It's consistent
with what you're

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.560
able to do in the UI.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.080
So if your domain allows your
documents to be shared outside

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.240
of your domain--

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.780
to, like, Gmail accounts--

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.120
then you should be able to do
it with the API, as well.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.530
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.070
Thank you.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.790
AUDIENCE: My question is,
you associate files

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.750
through MIME types.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.430
What if another app also
registers for that MIME type?

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:55.990
Can you prevent them from
opening your file?

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: The user
ultimately wins.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.510
Where is the Chrome book?

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.820
Here.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.620
So the user is able to go into
the Manage Apps setting, and

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.400
then decide what
the default is.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.420
So I don't know which gets the
default option, but the user

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.220
ultimately can decide.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.460
AUDIENCE: But you
cannot prevent--

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.460
the user has control?

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: The
user has control.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.304
That's right.

00:27:18.304 --> 00:27:21.090
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.050
AUDIENCE: My question is, I was
in the session with Forms

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:25.260
and Apps Script as well.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.355
Is there any cross,

00:27:26.355 --> 00:27:28.570
interoperability between the two?

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.540
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.020
Well, not directly.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.960
But it all runs with
the same ecosystem

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.100
of Google Apps Script.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.880
So you could conceivably write
an app that you're able to

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.900
have a icon in the Create option
that, when you click on

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.030
it, creates five new
Google forms.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.600
So you're able to script weaving
all the different APIs

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.160
together, and build some
interesting workflows just

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.240
like you describe.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:51.710
AUDIENCE: Could you even
do it the other

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.700
way, where the form--

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.290
you can attach maybe an
assignment to the form and

00:27:56.290 --> 00:28:00.170
have that go into Drive?

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:01.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I'd have to
think about that a little bit.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:02.850
Maybe you could chat in
the Office Hours?

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:06.960
But you'd have to manage
that linking yourself.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.230
I'm [? Devesh ?]

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.930
[? Pramani ?] from
[? Cloud Coach. ?]

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.830
I have a couple of questions.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.980
First, when you're copying a
document using the APIs, is

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.590
there any way to copy the script
associated with the

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.740
document, like a spreadsheet?

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.590
When I copy a spreadsheet
through an API, the script

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.990
doesn't get copied.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.660
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Is that right?

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:24.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.112
It's only the document
you copy.

00:28:27.112 --> 00:28:28.370
The script doesn't get copied.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.970
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.350
I wasn't familiar-- is that only
for documents, or also

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.540
for spreadsheets?

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.450
AUDIENCE: Spreadsheet,
sites, everything.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.470
Whenever I do copy site
or copy documents--

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.690
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So copying from
the UI is copying the

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.680
scripts, but not the--

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.450
AUDIENCE: I'm using APIs
to copy spreadsheet or

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.900
document the site.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.800
Only the content gets
copied, except the

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.690
script doesn't get copied.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:45.965
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:28:45.965 --> 00:28:47.984
We'll have to investigate
that.

00:28:47.984 --> 00:28:49.010
AUDIENCE: Second thing is about

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.190
performance of Apps Script.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.630
Is there anything that you have
standard best practices

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.640
by which we can optimize
performance?

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.420
Because as data starts
increasing with associated

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.720
spreadsheet, it starts
degrading.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.830
And there is--

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.810
is there a best practice that
you have, or something?

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.360
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So, yeah,
there's actually a section on

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.200
our website about how
do you optimize

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.810
spreadsheet-based access.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.080
There's batch access
and batch write.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.180
At some point, you may even
exceed those thresholds.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.740
A spreadsheet's not
a database.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.880
And we have other products like
Fusion Table and BigQuery

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.640
that solve the millions
of rows problem.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.230
So there's a fine line
there somewhere.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.990
But for hundreds of rows, even
thousands of rows, I've seen

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.150
if you use the batch access
methods that we have, you're

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.680
able to get decent
performance.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.600
And there's also caching
available.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.950
So if you could prevent from
going back into the

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.900
spreadsheet every 10 minutes, or
whatever the threshold is,

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.080
that might also help
performance.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.420
The caching service.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:46.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:48.490
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:49.990
AUDIENCE: My question
is about finding the

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.300
scripts that I create.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.780
Like, I've created scripts for
documents before, and I have

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.250
to open the document and
then go to Script

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.690
Manager to find them.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.570
With these that aren't
necessary linked to a

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.000
particular document, will they
just show up in my Drive list?

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.310
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.380
Yeah, that's a really
good question.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.320
So scripts, depending on how
you create them, are

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.320
first-class items in Drive.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.490
So if you create them from the
Create menu here, or go to

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.790
script.google.com, they're
considered top-level scripts.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.060
And they will show up here,
and you can share them and

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.340
move them into a folder just
like any other file.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.170
But if they are within a
spreadsheet or within a

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.460
document, think of it
almost like an image

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.940
embedded in that document.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.280
So it kind of gets encapsulated
within the

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.260
document, and you share it
with the document itself.

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.520
It's not a separate item.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.465
It's called container-bound
scripts is the term we use.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.072
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:39.072 --> 00:30:42.750
My question is, can documents
created with the Drive SDK or

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.100
Apps Script scripts
that you make be

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.490
made available offline?

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:48.380
JOHN MCGOWAN: Yes.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.830
They can be made available
offline, but you can't edit

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.530
them offline--

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.710
unless it's like a
Google document

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:58.280
that has offline enabled.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.730
AUDIENCE: So it's just
a read-only view?

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.110
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Well, it should
manage what the sync

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.830
tool already does.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.220
So I'll have to think
about the one.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.940
That's a really interesting
question.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.770
Come by the Office Hours
right after this.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:10.360
AUDIENCE: We can
give that a try

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.390
ARUN NAGARAJAN: We'll
do a quick test.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.160
Thank you.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.780
AUDIENCE: You said that you'd
removed the email addresses

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.570
from the API.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.910
So is there any way to get a
list of documents that a user

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:23.880
has access to?

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.240
Or if you've got a document, get
the list of users who have

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.670
access to that document?

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.800
JOHN MCGOWAN: You can get a list
of documents that a user

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.690
has access to using the
search functionality.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.660
However, at this point, you
can't get a list of email

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.620
addresses that have access
to a document.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:41.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.210
So if I know a particular
document, I can't see who else

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.330
has access to that?

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:48.010
JOHN MCGOWAN: Correct

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.730
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You can ask--

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.750
if you also know an email
address, and you know the

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.890
document, you could say, does
this person have access?

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:55.880
But that's about it.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.290
You cannot just get a list of
all email addresses against

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:58.870
the document.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:59.320
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.080
Is that even in Google
Apps for Business, if

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.010
the document is--

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.050
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's
correct.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.470
Regarding the other question
about searching for your

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:13.930
script files--

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.960
when you have hundreds of
documents, is there any way to

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.870
look into just the script
files you have?

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.530
Because it's complicated, like
scrolling down between all the

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.500
documents to find just
the script ones.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:31.920
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yeah.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.780
That's a good idea--

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.720
write a script to find
all your scripts.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.350
I don't know what we have
that would solve that.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.730
JOHN MCGOWAN: You should be able
to do searches based on

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.833
script in the advance search
functionality.

00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:47.970
I'm not sure if--

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.220
There's no script there.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.690
JOHN MCGOWAN: There is
no script there.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:51.130
ARUN NAGARAJAN: All right.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.440
JOHN MCGOWAN: All right.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.790
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Point taken.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:54.400
But you could--

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.885
AUDIENCE: You can write scripts
in folders now.

00:32:56.885 --> 00:33:00.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
what I do.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.640
JOHN MCGOWAN: OK, cool.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.860
Thank you.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:03.270
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:08.480
Regarding the Drive search, did
wildcards make it into the

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.120
new version?

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.690
JOHN MCGOWAN: We did update
the Drive API with this.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.390
But since it's based on the
Drive API, we offer the same

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.040
search functionality
as the Drive API.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.060
AUDIENCE: But wildcards
are not in?

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.990
JOHN MCGOWAN: I'm not
entirely sure.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.020
I think the answer is no.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.040
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Not
at this point.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:25.590
JOHN MCGOWAN: Not
at this point.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, good afternoon.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.600
Is there access to the version
control functionality that's

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:38.140
inside documents and
spreadsheets by the SDK?

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.170
JOHN MCGOWAN: The new
Drive service?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.010
AUDIENCE: The versioning
inside documents.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.620
So one of the things I'm trying
to do is try to version

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.420
lock aspects of the document,
or a document in a certain

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.170
amount of time.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.850
I've not managed to
find any way of

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.760
looking into the versions.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.330
JOHN MCGOWAN: OK.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.160
At this point, we don't support
that in the Drive

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.400
service that we just launched
for Apps Script.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.730
I think you can get the
change log using

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.880
the Drive API, though.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.824
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:05.824 --> 00:34:07.240
AUDIENCE: That's only for
library files, though.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.600
But the Google Docs revision
history isn't exposed in any

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.950
API right now.

00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.750
But we know that we're bad
for doing that, and--

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.690
AUDIENCE: You're bad, you say?

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.880
He's bad.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.984
ARUN NAGARAJAN: That's the
guy you want to convince.

00:34:18.984 --> 00:34:21.564
AUDIENCE: Currently, we are
figuring out ways of making

00:34:21.564 --> 00:34:24.600
ourselves feel less
bad about that.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.830
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Not solving
the problem, just

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:26.850
feeling less bad.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.330
AUDIENCE: Just version control
is a big deal for legal audit

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.489
trail for a lot of enterprises,
yeah?

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.820
Thanks.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.139
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.040
AUDIENCE: I think
to that earlier

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.420
question, if you type--

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.150
or, going into Google Drive, and
Create With, I think you

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.530
can choose Apps Script to bring
up your app scripts.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:44.300
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Oh, yeah.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.163
AUDIENCE: Also, with the Doc
List, are we going to-- you're

00:34:47.163 --> 00:34:48.960
going to deprecate that
over a period of time?

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.739
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Yep.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:51.360
So Docs List is deprecated.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.449
There's no sort of date
announced at this point where

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:55.370
that will be turned off.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:59.000
But it's standard deprecation
policy, so we have an

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.520
alternative now in Drive App.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.890
So we encourage you
to shift over.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:03.540
And like John said, it
was actually a very

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.890
straightforward exercise.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:07.140
We've taken care to ensure
that the APIs are pretty

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.070
consistent.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.623
So it should be sort of an
afternoon type thing.

00:35:11.623 --> 00:35:13.890
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:14.800
AUDIENCE: Hello, again.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:21.040
Regarding revision history, is
there any roadmap to have

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.150
Drive be involved with Vault?

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:26.960
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Good question.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.160
I don't have any updates
on that.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.430
That's a good question.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.220
Do you know?

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.279
JOHN MCGOWAN: I do not know.

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:33.529
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.390
AUDIENCE: Question
about delegation.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.190
Will it support delegation, the
Drive API, in Apps Script

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.440
eventually?

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.980
JOHN MCGOWAN: That's something
that we're working on in Drive

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.900
API that we know about.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.930
So right now, Drive API
doesn't support it.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.690
So we can't support it with
the Drive service, either,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.290
since we're built
on top of them.

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So one of the
things you could do with Apps

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.840
Script is that you could run
it as the developer.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.970
And then the developer has admin
rights, some of those

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:06.210
things will come through.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:10.400
But what is difficult is the
hybrid models run partially as

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.130
the user, and run partially
as the administrator.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.200
Those are the situations
that become difficult.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.110
But if you think about building
your application,

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.670
knowing that there's
two options--

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.530
run as the developer, and
run as the user--

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.810
you can actually build most use
cases through if you just

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.210
kind of think through
that with that lens.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:28.516
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:28.516 --> 00:36:31.610
Now what I've done, but not
with Apps Script, is

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.660
delegation.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.520
Like, you can install the
scope in the domain.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.130
And then you can act like
an administrator.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.130
You are--

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:46.060
the user is an administrator,
but can't specify which user

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.790
to pretend to be.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:51.790
That's something that you are
considering integrating into

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.110
Apps Script?

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.070
ARUN NAGARAJAN: We're
looking into it.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.480
No updates at this point.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:56.810
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:58.600
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Thank you.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:58.692
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:58.692 --> 00:37:00.950
This might be slightly off
topic, but I was curious if

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:03.220
we're going to have any options
to export in native

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.230
format from Drive coming
anytime soon?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:08.760
I mean, I realize that
Word export is--

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.240
or, Microsoft exports and Open
Doc are pretty high fidelity.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.520
But there's a lot of--

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.570
in my situation, there's a lot
of users who are transferring

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.240
data from one account to
another, and they end up

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.520
exporting it and converting
it, and uploading it and

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.200
converting it to a different
account via take out or via

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.890
the Drive interface.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.440
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So
theoretically, you could build

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.900
that with the set owner API.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.940
So you could theoretically
say, run a script that

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.180
iterates through all my files
and sets the owner to another

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.380
Google account.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.746
AUDIENCE: As long as you're--

00:37:39.746 --> 00:37:41.240
when you're in Google
Apps, though.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.770
I meant Google Apps Education.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.600
And whenever we tried
to do that to

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.660
get out of the domain--

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:46.740
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Education
has that limitation.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.050
AUDIENCE: --it will
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:49.690
So we have people leaving--

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.500
for example, seniors graduating
high school.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.750
And we're forcing them to export
everything and then

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.400
giving them instructions to
make a new Google Gmail

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.400
account or at their university
to upload everything, because

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.300
they can't-- it just comes to
a standstill when you try to

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.990
script out an export--

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.010
or, excuse me, an
owner change.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.340
ARUN NAGARAJAN: OK.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.350
Yeah, I think that's a document
setting with Google

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:12.050
Apps for Education.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:13.460
But we'll look into
how to solve this.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.300
AUDIENCE: Just a suggestion.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.020
Thank you.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.230
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You can make
a copy, that's right.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.120
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:24.000
Will we ever be able to share
scripts across domains?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.270
ARUN NAGARAJAN: You
can share scripts

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:26.900
across domains already.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.030
It's just like any other file.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.800
So what you can do is--

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.720
it's easy enough to--

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.930
AUDIENCE: But to
a whole domain.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.190
So for example, I want to share
this script to this

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.750
whole domain.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.890
Everybody from this domain that
is not mine can't access

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:40.710
the script.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:41.980
So I know I can do
it specifically

00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:42.640
to get to one person.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.976
ARUN NAGARAJAN: I see.

00:38:44.976 --> 00:38:47.940
AUDIENCE: The chances are that
you can do that already.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.398
But what's confusing about it
is that if you share an item

00:38:51.398 --> 00:38:53.868
with a very large group of
people, like your whole

00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:56.832
domain, you need to publish a
link that they can click.

00:38:56.832 --> 00:38:59.960
It won't automatically show up
in their Drives until they go

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.278
and look at the file.

00:39:01.278 --> 00:39:05.724
And that's done to stop hacks
and spam on every single thing

00:39:05.724 --> 00:39:06.712
available to the domain.

00:39:06.712 --> 00:39:09.923
But if you've got the internal
website, for example, you

00:39:09.923 --> 00:39:12.640
could say, hey everybody who
wants to do this, click this

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.780
link, and then you'll
be able to see this

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.098
script in Google Drive.

00:39:16.098 --> 00:39:18.815
So just set the settings so
that it's shared in your

00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:20.050
domain and publish
a link to it.

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:22.530
And it'll just work.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.456
ARUN NAGARAJAN: So I
think we have time

00:39:23.456 --> 00:39:24.340
for one more question.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:27.200
We will be at the Office
Hours right after this.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.705
AUDIENCE: This isn't as much
of a question, Arun, but I

00:39:29.705 --> 00:39:32.220
just wanted to +1 what Doug
said very strongly.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.130
We have the same kind of a
situation at the University of

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.040
Minnesota where we're
trying to move

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.240
people between domains.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.300
We have five different campus
accounts, like domains.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:44.360
And we'd love to just update
the metadata on your end to

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.050
push them all into one domain.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.440
But yeah, find and replace
across all of Google for one

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.500
email address for a different
email address.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.690
The left hand side's the same.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:54.550
The right hand side changes a
little bit, a few characters.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:56.140
And then everybody would
be super happy.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.510
JOHN MCGOWAN: Got it.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.130
So this is--

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:58.150
OK.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.530
AUDIENCE: It's because like you
guys showed you can make

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.380
it where you can
share something

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.540
with that whole domain.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:06.650
Well, we've got some things that
now are across campuses--

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.180
between multiple campuses-- and
then you try to share it

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.990
with the whole domain, and it's
like, I shared it with

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.110
the whole domain--

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.800
oh, except for all the
people in Duluth.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.810
That's 30,000 people.

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.820
So I tried to think of like,
could I make an All at Duluth,

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.030
and share with that, too.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.700
But then it doesn't
really work well.

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.750
It would show up nowhere until
they would click a link, and

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.990
stuff like that, to be able to
see the thing on their side.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.620
And it could be much easier to
have everybody all in one

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.270
organization.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.950
ARUN NAGARAJAN: Understood.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:32.790
Thank you.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:33.460
All right, guys.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.210
Thank you so much for
all the questions.

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.330
And hope you enjoyed it.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:36.930
JOHN MCGOWAN: Thank you.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:40.092
