00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.660
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly for

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.930
September 23, 2013.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.110
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.820
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.560
on the set and off.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.190
Strap in, buckle up.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.400
We've got a lot to talk about.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.920
First, beautiful code and
intelligent applications often

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.560
lead to happy users, but if an
application or a website

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.490
confuses a user, it introduces
friction and it can stop your

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.670
startup cold.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.370
Nazmul Idris, a champion for
user experience, stopped by

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.000
Root Access with host Don
Dodge to teach us how to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.880
reduce friction and boost
user acquisition.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.880
As you can imagine, here at Team
GDL, we believe strongly

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.970
in the power of YouTube
subscriptions.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.920
From New York, Ibrahim Ulukaya
and Kurt Wilms walked us

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.290
through how to code and
customize the recently

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.840
launched Subscribe button,
bringing your videos to those

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.440
users who don't want to miss a
single minute of your content.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.980
We then saw the Google Analytics
duo of Andrew Wales

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.440
and Neil Rhodes introduce us
to Google Tag Manager for

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.900
Android and iOS, making it
easier to update website data

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.780
and mobile apps to measure
traffic and user behavior to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.090
make your products
even better.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.740
And in a new feature here on
GDL, we invited the Google

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.930
Enterprise Maps Team for
the first episode

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.750
of What in the World?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.640
Dylan and Ryan Thomas, who I
assume are not related, showed

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.490
us how to access Google Maps
Engine layers using Maps API

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.640
JavaScript.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.530
Keep in mind, this replaces the
map data layer for those

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.880
of you who are geocoders.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.630
Looking at my map, it turns out
our next GDL came from the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.970
southern hemisphere from Buenos
Aires, where Nick

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.410
returned with the latest from
Latin America, talking Chrome

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.950
browser extensions.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.390
[SPANISH].

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.150
And before the week wrapped, Don
Dodge was back for round

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.760
two of Root Access in our
studio, explaining the many

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.470
variables behind startup stock
ownership and what founders,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.870
investors, and employees should
expect when they open

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.200
the envelopes containing
their options packages.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.320
This is something you have
to get right to keep your

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.220
employee morale high.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.850
In addition to all these great
shows, we were invited to live

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.800
stream from SFHTML5, the world's
largest HTML5 user

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.010
group, featuring many faces that
you recognize from GDL

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.270
including Colt McAnlis,
Paul Lewis, Paul

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.900
Irish, and Jake Archibald.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.780
The two plus hour event featured
four fantastic talks

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440
covering web performance, and
we've got it all saved for you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.620
here on YouTube.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.320
So cancel your plans tonight.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.560
You've got homework.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.510
And from Italy, Claudio
d'Angelis

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.940
talked to us about Dart.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.570
Claudio discussed how to take
advantage of Dart when using

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.600
model-driven views and web
components to build your apps.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.370
Very nice.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.730
So as you can see, we've been
hard at work sharing the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.440
latest from all around
Google this week.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.190
The same is true for our
friends at Android, who

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.080
dropped five brand new Dev Bytes
episodes for you mobile

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.410
developers, and the latest in
the Game On series featuring

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.290
Google Games chats' own
Todd Kerpelman.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.750
So find all of those and more
at the Android Developers

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.851
YouTube channel and at
developers.googl

00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.540
e.com/live/android.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.510
Outside the studio, you saw the
demo at Google I/O, and

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.780
now you can read the docs and
implement it yourself.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.050
The Instant Buy API for Android
makes it incredibly

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.750
easy for your customers to buy
an item and check out as

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.080
easily as if they were using
the Google Play store.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.210
No manual entry of billing
or shipping info

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.320
means happier customers.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.100
The Chrome team has added to its
collection of dashboards

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.990
with new CSS Metrics chart.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.720
Using anonymous opt-in stats
from Chrome, the new dashboard

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.280
shows how many pages were
visited by users using each of

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.890
435 CSS properties.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.990
You can see which properties
have been used or look at a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.150
usage timeline of one
particular property.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.100
Take a look and watch for more
dashing dashboards for Chrome

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.080
usage coming in the future.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.550
Heading back into the cloud,
this week BigQuery added nifty

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.800
new features.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.230
You can now analyze data in
real time by using the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.620
tabledata.InsertAll call, very
useful when you need to know

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.050
what's going on right away.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.560
BigQuery also added table
decorators, which are not

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.720
pretty centerpieces but a syntax
for enabling you to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.180
query only a subset of the
newest data instead of the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.310
full table.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.600
And finally, we added a bunch
of new functions and new web

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.780
UI features.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.360
Also, a big change for AdSense
developers this week.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.480
AdSense now provides add code
that works with HTTPS.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.460
This is more important than
ever now that browsers are

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.810
getting more aggressive about
warning or even blocking pages

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.650
with mixed secure and
standard content.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.700
By using the new code in
either synchronous or

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.210
asynchronous flavors, you can
ensure that your pages won't

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.740
suffer this indignity.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.579
And to make sure you don't
suffer the indignity of

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.209
missing a single thing from
the world of Google

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.880
Developers, subscribe to Google
Developers on YouTube

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.980
and check out the GDL schedule
at developers.google.com/live.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.330
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll see
you back in the studio.
