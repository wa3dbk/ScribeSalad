00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's look at modern remote
debugging with Chrome.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.263
I'm going to take
the URL of this demo

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:05.990
and open it up in
Chrome on Android.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.070
And now on the remote debugging
page, we see its GPU layers.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.030
More on that later.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.942
What I really want to show
you is this-- Screencast.

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:16.650
You're looking at the
live view of Chrome

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.992
on Android on your machine.

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:19.950
It shows exactly what's
happening on the device

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.491
all the time.

00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:23.380
But better than that, you can
actually interact with it.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.410
So typing here with
my fingers is slow.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.380
Let's switch the keyboard.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.260
Yeah, so all keystrokes are
sent down to the device.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.090
And clicks and drags are
sent down as touches, too.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.590
You can scroll with
your mouse wheel

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.130
or trackpad and see your
device scroll with you.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.710
Probably my favorite is--
yep, inspect element.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.170
It works the way
you'd want it to,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.086
selecting the elements
in the device's browser

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:48.150
and manipulating them directly.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.480
Now back to those GPU layers.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.100
Here's a complex 3D
CSS transform scene.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340
And DevTools gives us insight
on the live layer tree

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.550
composition.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.440
Similarly Screencasted
remote debugging

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.290
works great with
the web GL profiler.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.960
Please try all this out today.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.000
For how, just google
for remote debugging.
