JOHANNA WRIGHT: So now
I'm so excited to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.680
introduce Diane Greene.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.220
Diane Greene is the
latest member of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.930
Google's Board of Directors.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.400
She's also a board member
for Intuit and MIT.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.070
Diane is probably most well
known for founding VMware.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.020
VMware went on to define the
visualization industry.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.950
Diane was the CEO of VMware
from 1998 to 2008.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.230
She took the company to $2
billion in revenue, and she

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.490
took the company public.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.610
When I heard that I got to be
on the same panel as Diane

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.590
Greene, I was flabbergasted,
and so excited.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710
Despite how intimidating her
resume sounds, Diane Greene is

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.070
actually quite approachable.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.490
I heard her speak last year at
a Google event and I went up

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.500
and introduced myself
afterwards, and she was very

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.320
friendly and nice.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.450
So if you get the opportunity
afterwards, I would encourage

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.790
you to shake her hand.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.450
Diane is also a national
champion sailor.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.260
And with that, Diane.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.220
DIANE GREENE: Thank you
for that introduction.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.830
She went further than
I suggested she go.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.390
So how did I manage to
do these things?

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.020
What I thought I would do is
take you on a whirlwind tour

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.570
of my life and try and highlight
where I thought I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.750
learned valuable things.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.860
And I grew up sailing,
racing sailboats.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.760
And when you race a boat, first
you have to build a

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.850
team, and you have to get your
team all aligned on a single

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.560
goal, which is to
win the race.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.270
And then you need your strategy
to win the race.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.260
You have to understand what the
wind's doing, understand

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.780
what the currents are doing,
and pay attention to your

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.950
competitors.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.840
And if your competitors surprise
you or you get a wind

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.850
shift, you have to immediately
react and handle that and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.979
continue winning the race.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.610
And the last thing is the
engineering around sailing.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.960
You have to prepare your boat.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.500
It has to be ready to go fast.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.660
Then you have to tune it while
on the race course to keep

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.230
going fast.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.990
And I think that's what
led me to train.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.600
I trained as a mechanical
engineer and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.040
then a naval architect.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.720
I came out to the Bay Area
to San Francisco

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.630
for my first job.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.960
And the first thing I was given
to do was analyze some

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.730
mooring, a mooring for an
offshore oil platform that was

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.560
used for firefighting.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.770
And there was a big Fortran
program that looked like it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.790
was the way to model this.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.520
And so that's when I learned
how to program.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.000
And it was just this incredibly

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.520
powerful tool, software.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.250
You could do anything with it.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.470
Got pretty excited about it.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.580
Was not very excited about
sitting inside behind a desk.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.780
I really came to the Bay Area
for the windsurfing.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.470
And so I quit that job and I
moved to Hawaii where I think

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.340
I've had perhaps one of my
favorite periods of my life.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.540
I lived sort of in a commune
where we were exploring.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.110
Windsurfing was sort
of an early

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.910
microcosm of the tech industry.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.420
We were just inventing
all kinds of things--

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.940
new sails, high aspect
sails, new shapes

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.740
of boards, new materials.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.230
And all we did was build and
test this equipment every day.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.290
It was really tremendous.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.590
And from there, I went and ran
engineering for Windsurfing

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.190
International.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.950
That was the company that had
the patent on the windsurfer,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.700
which also taught me how abused
patents can be, because

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.910
they tried to control a very
rapidly expanding industry

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.230
with their patents.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.670
I left that.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.899
Well, all this time, I continued
to study software.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.820
I went back up to the Bay Area
and enrolled in a graduate

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.650
program in computer science
at UC Berkeley.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.200
Berkeley was a pretty happening
place at that point.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.790
The grad students had a lab
full of brand new Sun

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.960
workstations that were based on
this Unix, a relatively new

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.420
open operating system.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.960
Richard Stallman, who wrote
the GPL license,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.770
was hanging out there.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.240
I got to see the first graphical
user interface, and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.370
it was just very exciting.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.990
And I knew it's what I
wanted to keep doing.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.980
I did still yearn
for adventure.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.520
I've always really loved
adventure, so I took a brief

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.850
interlude and used my computer
skills to be the computer

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.190
expert on a marine archaeology
expedition in Sipan where we

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.460
excavated a Spanish galleon
and found gold.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.170
And then I came back to the Bay
Area and went to work at a

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.800
succession of companies
in the tech industry.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.410
The first one was Sybase, where
I really got hit over

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.550
the head with the value of
having engineers across

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.520
companies work together.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.870
I made friends with an engineer
at Sun, it turned out

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.450
he was a windsurfer, and we
spend a few months windsurfing

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.050
and writing software and were
able to get sort of an order

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.340
of magnitude performance
increase in the Sybase system

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.720
running on Sun.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.120
And I really used that
when I built VMware.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.240
All three companies were quite
an education in how important

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.880
it is to embrace change and
always go forward, invest in

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.270
the future.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.540
Sybase didn't want to rework
their system to support

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.570
symmetric multiprocessing
processing, and that's sort of

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.830
why Oracle eclipsed them.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.930
I went to work at Tandem that
had the world's best database

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.640
management system, but it ran
on proprietary hardware and

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.380
proprietary operating system.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.030
And it was too hard to see the
business model for moving to

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.820
commodity open systems, and
they sort of sailed into

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.000
oblivion, getting bought by
Compaq and then by HP.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.770
And then I went to work for
SGI, which was a pretty

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.670
aggressive tech company at that
point in time and worked

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.750
on interactive television,
which was a

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.390
really exciting project.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:05.580
But again, the internet
was happening and it

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.120
was starting at SGI.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.420
But instead, the founder of
SGI, Jim Clark, left and

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.940
founded Netscape, and
a number of us

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.240
left and started companies.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.400
And that's when I finally
just decided

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.100
to stick with startups.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.730
And so I did two successive
smaller startups.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.670
They both had great visions.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.590
I would say they maybe
executed too early.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.910
Nice financial outcomes.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.340
The first one was streaming
video over the internet, low

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.570
bandwidth, because there
wasn't much bandwidth.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.480
And the second was internet ad
serving, interestingly enough.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:52.170
At that point I took a little
time off and decided to found

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.720
VMware, which was based on some
work my husband was doing

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.560
at Stanford around
virtualization.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.460
And there's a few things I can
kind of relate to what we did

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.360
at VMware to what I had
already learned.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.830
For instance, Sun Microsystems
introduced these workstations.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.110
People loved these workstations,
and then brought

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.930
their servers into
the companies.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.680
And at VMware we used
the same strategy.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.510
We had a workstation software.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.250
People loved our workstation
software, and then when we

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.650
came out with the server
product, were pretty

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.460
quick to adopt it.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.760
We did amazing.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.929
Our engineers worked with
the hardware vendors.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.630
They worked with the
chip vendors.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.870
They worked with the
storage vendors.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.190
And then we worked with
all of those vendors

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.270
to take it to market.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.669
And I'm just a huge believer in

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.510
collaboration in the industry.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.100
And it was really effective for
VMware, but it was always

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.140
hard to convince other companies
to trust us and

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.020
partner with us.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:57.110
But I think we always won,
jointly, together.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.080
And then the last thing was just
sort of how to adapt, how

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.620
to embrace change.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.430
My job changed considerably from
zero to sort of 6,000,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.320
7,000 people the company
was when I left.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.810
And it's just sort of
recognizing, OK, this isn't

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.660
working and constantly
sectioning out parts of my job

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.000
that I just didn't have time for
anymore and hiring someone

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.470
to do those things.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:33.040
VMware was just a totally fun
adventure, building it with

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.450
all those people and seeing
the impact that it had.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:44.450
And what I would say is, it's
not so important how.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.990
There's just sort of
an infinite number

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.860
of ways to do things.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.440
But when you see something that
you're very interested

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.890
in, that you think it can have
some real impact, the thing

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:03.030
that's important is to codify
that vision, see that vision,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.880
enjoy the adventure of
building that vision.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.230
And if you do enjoy it, it makes
it fairly easy to be

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.490
fearless about it.
