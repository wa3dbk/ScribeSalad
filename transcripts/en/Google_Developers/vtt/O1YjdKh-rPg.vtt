PAUL KINLAN: Hi everyone.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.510
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.490
Welcome to our talk today,
called How to Build Apps that

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.530
Love Each Other.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.500
JAMES HAWKINS: Hi, I'm James.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.570
I'm the tech lead of the Chrome
team working to bring

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.640
Web Intents to the web.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.400
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.350
So, before we start, I
just want to ask one

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.200
little quick question.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.910
Actually, two questions.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.412
Who has heard of Web Intents?

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:26.125
JAMES HAWKINS: All right.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:26.795
PAUL KINLAN: Awesome.

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:30.960
Who has was actually built
anything with Web Intents?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.685
JAMES HAWKINS: That's awesome.

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.000
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, two people.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.590
Two or three people, cool.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.440
So, hopefully by the end of this
presentation, you'll all

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.650
be able to go away and start
building things with this work

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.040
that we call Web Intents.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.320
And today we're going to show
you some awesome stuff.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
So, today, before we start,
I'm going to highlight a

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.450
couple of problems.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.350
For me, the biggest problem
that we face on the web is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.110
that there's no way for
applications on the web to

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.720
understand the functionality
that other applications offer.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.130
And because we can't do this,
we can't do really cool

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.990
things, such as offer suggested
services for you to

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.520
use when you want to perform
an action on the web.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.200
But it also means our web
applications today, they don't

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.140
love each other.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.610
Applications are a lot
like a relationship.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.910
Well, they're not like a lot
like a relationship.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.110
But they're built off the
background of a really strong

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.050
communication.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.140
A great relationship is built
off strong communication, and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.700
likewise, web applications
should be able to love each

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030
other through strong
communication.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.220
So let's start with an image.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.670
An image is something that
we manipulate every day.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.590
We do things, we email them,
we edit them, we do crazy

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.040
amounts of things with images.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.460
So let's have a go.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.660
JAMES HAWKINS: Hopefully
this looks OK.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.830
PAUL KINLAN: There we are.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.250
Cool.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.420
So that we captured our image,
Right so let's do

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.460
some stuff with it.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.140
Well, the first thing that most
people want to do with an

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.560
image on the web, you want to
actually bring it in to your

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.520
application.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.805
And everyone in this room, if
you're a web developer or a

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.780
user, you're probably familiar
with this button.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.840
It's the input box.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.420
It's input type equals file.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.210
And this actually works
really well.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.900
It works really well because
one, it's simple to implement.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.530
But the second reason why it
works quite well is it's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.410
actually pretty easy
to users to use.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.990
They will choose a file, scan
the hard drive, and load it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.740
into their application.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.070
The complexity arises, though,
when you have multiple

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.700
applications which all
manipulate images and you want

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.070
to bring that data from
one app to another.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.635
So the process of getting, say,
an image into Gmail from,

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:24.380
say, a site like Flickr, is that
you normally have to go

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.360
to Flickr, right click
on the image,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.550
download it to your desktop.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.080
Everyone in this room's probably
got a temporary

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.990
downloads folder which is
probably a good couple hundred

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.760
megabytes in size, thousands
of files inside there.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.190
Anyway.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.290
You've downloaded your file
into this folder.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.030
You then jump back your email
application, click attach.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.120
Try and find the file, because
it's not always in last place

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.980
you actually found the file
the previous time around.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.320
And then you bring it back
into your application.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.870
For users, this is it's a bit
of a nightmare, right?

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.920
We can't build applications
coherently with this method.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.640
So let's have a look at
another use case.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.840
Edit an image.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.480
It's a very similar process.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.270
You have an application--

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.430
this is Psykopaint--

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.350
you have an application, you
want to bring data into it.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.690
So it's the same
process again.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.680
You have to load this
application up.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.370
And if it's in another app
already, if it's on Flickr,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.270
you have to download it onto
your desktop, jump into this

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.100
app, click Open, bring
it into the app.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.050
Then there's an extra step.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.010
Once you've edited this image,
you have to then go and save

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.920
it again to the desktop.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.700
So you've now got two
copies in your

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.270
temporary downloads folder.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.900
Jump back your previous app, and
then upload and attach it.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.350
We shouldn't have to face
these problems.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.240
Users shouldn't find
this complexity.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.100
And as developers, we don't have
nice ways of integration.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.910
It's all very manual work.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.370
Some services offer direct
API integrations.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.980
The problem with direct API
integrations is-- we've all

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.550
seen this before, OAuth--

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.240
all these different types
of complexities with

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.970
authentication, server-to-server

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.070
communication.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.230
These applications don't work
very well when you're offline

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.020
because you need to talk to
a server to give another

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.280
application data.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.330
It's horrible for developers and
it's not nice for users.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.330
Likewise, if you have an image,
and you've edited it,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.700
and you want to save it to make
sure it's all backed up.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.010
Well, you normally want to save
it to your desktop or

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.090
maybe to your cloud
storage solution.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.980
Right now, if you're developing
something and you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.640
want to save it to, well, in
this case, Drive, it's a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.750
direct API integration that
you have to build.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.339
Which is complex
because there's

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:17.860
authentication protocols.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.690
Once there's authentication
protocols, they're actually

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.520
pretty hard to debug because
working the clients is

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.400
different to the work that you
do in the server, and it's

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.540
really hard to debug those
two types of systems.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.500
And obviously we've got
things like OAuth.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.470
OAuth is relatively easy once
you get the hang of it, but

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.230
it's actually complex
to get started.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.880
And we don't want to have to
deal with that on the web.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.370
And then, once you've saved it,
and you're happy with the

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.550
fact that you've got a nice back
up, you want to send it

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.950
out somewhere.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.940
You want to send your image
to your grandmother.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.130
Now, we face two problems on the
web-- or I think we face

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.580
two problems on the
web, at least.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.790
We have a temporary solution, a
solution that already exists

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.730
on the web called mail2.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.720
The mail2 scheme.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.920
Now that works quite well, but
when you've got an application

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.070
that doesn't know your entire
contact address book or your

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.140
social networking, your social
graph, well, your application

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.690
won't know the recipients that
you want to send the data to.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.140
Which means, well, how'd you
actually know that you're

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.100
going to send something
to your grandmother?

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.680
Because the mail2 link
will be blank.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.080
It's pretty complex.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.860
And then the second part this
problem is mail2 works pretty

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.570
well if you want to attach a
subject, a title, and some

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.490
basic description to an email.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.490
Browsers have got that pretty
much locked down for trying to

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.720
do that type of stuff.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.390
But we have an image.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.790
This is a real blob of data.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.010
How do we get our real blob of
data from our site directly

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.440
into another application?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.650
We can't do with the
existing protocols.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.630
And then, if you look at the way
that users have to do this

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.710
today, well, it's exactly the
same process, the same set of

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.520
steps that we saw before.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.580
The user takes their data from
another application, downloads

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.830
it into a temporary store,
goes back to this email

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.780
application, clicks attach.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.330
It's a really familiar process,
and it's just not

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.080
great for users.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.570
And users don't like the app.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.000
They kind of like the apps that
we're going, but we can

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.630
make our applications
a lot better.

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.760
And then we looked at the idea
of send an email like a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.300
one-to-one communication.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.450
Everyone knows this use case.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.110
The ability to share some piece
of data with multiple

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.880
different types of
social networks.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.240
Well, at this mention that
there's at least three hundred

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.940
different types of
sharing services.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.550
So what's that mean for you
as a web developer?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.890
Well, you can't feasibly
integrate with all 300

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.570
different types of services
so you can use and

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.920
aggregate the service.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.700
But the problem is, the way that
these applications are

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.600
built, and the way you interact
with these APIs,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.670
there's normally two methods.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.120
There's a widget and a
server-to-server integration.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.910
Widgets are great.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.140
You can just drop
a small piece of

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.560
JavaScript on your page.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.750
But the problem that it
introduces is every time you

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.310
add an extra widget, your
page load is delayed.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.350
It gets longer and longer
and longer.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.710
And each widget that you put
into your application is a

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.440
tight coupling to
that service.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.210
Not great, because you might
have users that don't use the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.060
services that you're offering.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.610
If you have unhappy users, you
might have no users at some

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.000
point in the future.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.160
And then the next is
server-to-server integration.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.700
We have these services where
we can send data to another

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.570
service just by doing an
OAuth authenticated

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.980
request to the server.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.860
The problem with this
is it's relatively

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.020
complex to do OAuth.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.310
It's hard to maintain, it's
very hard to debug.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.290
You never actually quite know
if you've got the problem

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.420
yourself with the way that
you've done the integration,

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.850
or whether it's the other
service so that's got a

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:09.940
temporary problem.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.660
It's just a bit of
a pain to debug.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.810
And, obviously, it requires
an internet connection.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.970
If you want to send a status
update to a social network,

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.620
you have to have an internet
connection to be able to

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.070
deliver data between these two
apps and two services.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.310
It's not easy, right?

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.590
This is me, I'm really
unhappy.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.690
I'm a developer and
I'm also user.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.990
For me, as a developer, I don't
want to have to maintain

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.730
all these direct integrations.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.840
If a new service comes out, I
don't want to have to keep

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.060
adding more and more and
more integrations.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.480
And, likewise, if a service dies
and no longer exists, I

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.030
have to keep track of all
these services that add.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.140
I don't want to have to maintain
and remove all the

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.666
services as they come
into life and leave.

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:48.530
And as a user, I want choice.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.760
I want to be able to use the
services I want to for common

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.100
actions across the web.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.440
So if I want to share to a
particular social network, I

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.400
should be allowed to do that.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.870
If I want to save some data
to my cloud, I should

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.440
be able to do that.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.480
And I don't think, to date,
we can easily do that.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.700
So what can we do?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.660
What would it look like if we
could build a solution that

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.210
was better?

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.180
Well, ideally, it would
be client-side first.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.920
Everyone, probably, in this
room is probably quite

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.670
familiar with this.

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.640
This isn't the solution, this
is some of the problem.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.140
We have two applications that
live inside the browser.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.360
And to get data from one
application to another

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.700
application, we have to send
data from our client

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.380
application to our application
server.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.720
The application server has to
communicate with the remote

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.890
service server, potentially do
some authentication protocols

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.990
and some authentication work to
actually make sure the user

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.530
is sending the data
to the service.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.210
And then the user will open up
the other site, which will

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.530
then talk to that application
service.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:41.860
This is actually kind
of brittle, right?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.190
If any one of these points goes
down, we have got two

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.990
applications that can't
talk to each other.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.060
It's pretty complex.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.610
So ideally, we have these two

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.330
applications inside the browser.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.990
We should be able to open up
one application, open up

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.830
another application, then just
deliver data from one app to

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.820
the other without having to
go across the internet.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.850
And this is really cool, because
once we can do these

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.780
types of things, we can start to
build truly offline-enabled

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:05.780
applications.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.700
So has anyone use Appcache?

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.380
A couple of people.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.360
We all know that Appcache is
actually pretty hard to work

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.170
with and pretty hard to debug,
pretty hard to maintain.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.240
But it actually starts
to make our

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.760
applications available offline.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.050
The problem is, right now if
you want to integrate with

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.600
another service, even if that
other service is Appcache

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.120
enabled and works offline, you
still need the whole internet

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.160
connection to be able to deliver
data to the app.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.790
And what we're saying is, for a
lot of actions such as, say,

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.200
editing an image, you shouldn't
have to require on a

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.510
whole internet connection just
deliver data between these two

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.660
applications.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.370
So, with a solution that we want
to try and propose, it

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.690
should work, and it should
enable you to build

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.740
applications that
work offline.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.540
And ideally, it should
be loosely coupled.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.980
This is the best image
I could find that

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.300
wasn't a class diagram.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.630
The idea is we should be able to
use any particular clients

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.630
with any particular service.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.820
And that it should be
down to the user

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.320
to use those services.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.840
The user should be able to say,
I'm going to use Google

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.770
or Twitter to actually
share some data.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.280
Rather than us, as developers
of the client applications,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.510
enforcing that upon
the user, right?

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.030
That's what we want
from a solution.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.850
And, ideally, it should handle
the user's intents.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.350
This is, obviously, the name
of Web Intents, right?

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.090
The user should say, I need
to edit an image.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.965
The user has a set task that
they're going to do with

00:10:19.965 --> 00:10:21.170
something on the web.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.360
They need to edit an image.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.000
They need to edit an image
with their preferred

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.180
application.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.580
They need to share
a link with their

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.740
preferred social network.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.030
They need to save a document to
their preferred cloud file

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.750
storage solution.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.150
The user always wants to do
something in the browser with

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.160
the data that your applications
are producing,

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.150
and you should be able
to let them do

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.220
that with a good solution.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.620
And ideally it should
be familiar.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.510
It should be familiar to
millions of users.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.050
Millions of users using Android
system are familiar

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.490
with the ability to actually
find applications to fulfill

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.110
common actions on that device.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.850
And ideally, for developers, the
API should look relatively

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.260
similar what--

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.450
I don't know how many
developers are--

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.380
it should actually look
relatively similar to the APIs

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.430
that are offered on the systems
that already exist.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.220
So introducing Web Intents.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.160
Obviously, we've given the name
away up front, about this

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.490
is a talk about Web Intents.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.590
But this is our proposed
solution for actually enabling

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.440
you to integrate with remote
services any service that you

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.370
want to that supports
the APIs.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.390
So what is a Web Intent?

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.850
It isn't the next generation of

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.740
internet-enabled camping equipment.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.200
I'm really sorry for
that one, guys.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.710
It is a client-side framework
that allows users to use their

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.450
preferred applications for
actions on content-types.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.160
The really exciting thing
right now is that we're

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.560
actually working with a W3C,
and we're at first public

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.700
working draft, which is the
first step to standardization.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.750
We still got quite a way to go,
but we've actually got an

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.900
experimental build inside
Chrome, and we're going to

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.575
show you that today if you've
not seen it and

00:11:47.575 --> 00:11:48.240
already played with it.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.810
And we're going to show you some
of the things that you

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.360
can do with that.

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.390
So it's pretty cool.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.060
So how does it work?

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.190
We'll start with a demo.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.360
But before we jump into the
demo, I want to show you some

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.610
of the source code.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.470
So the application that we've
built is roughly about 40

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.310
lines of code, and we're going
to have the option to interact

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.250
with four different
types of services.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.100
This is a powerful
thing for me.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.030
You don't have to think about
how you're going to integrate

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.220
with services to be able
to start talk to them.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.230
If you don't have to think about
that, then you can just

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.690
concentrate on the things
that you do best.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.805
So let's just jump back to our
application and show you a

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:25.370
demo in action.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.770
So this is an application we've
built called Imagemator.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.530
It's not an amazingly
complex application.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.210
All it does is allow
you to orchestrate

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.200
operations on images.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.430
So the first thing that we need
to do is pick an image.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.950
This is the picker,
the intent picker.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.620
We've got a couple of
services on top.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.210
These are services that we've
installed, and suggestions on

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.620
the bottom.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.440
The suggestions come from
the Chrome Web Store.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.180
The really important thing about
this is we don't want

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.020
the users to ever be without a
service that can fulfill that

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.500
action, which is why the Chrome
Web Store is integrated

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.570
into this solution.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.770
So let's choose Cloud
File Picker.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.020
Cloud File Picker is another
application that we've built

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.200
as a demo application that
allows us to bring images in

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.110
from our Picasa account.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.210
It's pretty cool.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.640
So we've seen Google Glass,
it's pretty cool.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.540
I invented Google Glass
two years ago.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.800
It kind of worked.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.130
Admittedly--

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.300
It kind of worked, right?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.730
The resolution wasn't great.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.360
It wasn't 3D, though, that's
the good thing, right?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.600
JAMES HAWKINS: He's not
lying, this picture is

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.560
actually two years old.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.060
So I think he came
up with it first.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.640
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.930
So we brought in data from a
remote application into our

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:34.760
application.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.070
Both of our applications, they
don't know about each other,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.070
but they can talk to each other
and work with each other

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.140
like they do.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.330
So let's just try
one more thing.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.940
Let's edit the image.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.420
So the important thing to
remember about Intents, for

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.750
me, at least--

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.690
my favorite part of this-- is we
don't have to build a full

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.510
image editing suite.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.770
We can build an application
which just is quite

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.840
specialized in one
particular task.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.010
And Mememator is an
example of this.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.900
Mememator is just a little
service that adds funny text

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:01.990
to interesting pictures.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:03.240
So let's add some
text to this.

00:14:24.296 --> 00:14:27.128
JAMES HAWKINS: All right.

00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:27.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.780
PAUL KINLAN: Thank you.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.670
We didn't actually do that
one in practice.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.280
Cool.

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280
So this is really cool, right?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.270
We've got two different
applications, two remote

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.850
services, one client
application, and they've all

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.140
been able to talk
to each other.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.460
And yet they don't know
about each other.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.610
They only know about the types
of services that each

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.890
application offers.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.140
I think that's pretty
powerful.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.690
So just to briefly go over
how it works again.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.820
We have a client application,
and the user basically asks of

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.420
the browser, find me a list of
applications that support the

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.500
ability to, say edit an image,
or pick an image in this case.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.410
The browser will resolve the
list of either install

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.690
services, offer a list of
suggestions as well,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.520
potentially, and then deliver
the data client-side--

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.430
so we're not going through
the internet service--

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.430
deliver the data client-side
into the application.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.790
The user will do the work and
then pass the data back again

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.360
on the client-side without
having to go through servers,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.930
back into the client
application.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.020
And that's exactly what we've
just seen with Imagemator.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.620
JAMES HAWKINS: So.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.480
By now, you must be thinking
to yourself, wow, this is

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.930
really compelling.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.890
I can integrate with another
application and not have to

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.860
know what that application
actually is.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.070
So how to integrate your
application with Intents with

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.980
some other service?

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.340
In Web Intents parlance, the
service is the end point that

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.870
provides functionality
that a client

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.290
application can request.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.590
So here we have a couple
of services.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.430
We have an image editor that
is exposing the edit

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.790
functionality.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.520
We also have a cloud storage
application which is exposing

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.340
two functionality
that it can do.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:12.820
It can save images to the cloud
and it can also allow

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.890
clients to pick images
from the storage.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.870
So it's actually really
simple to integrate.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.460
You don't have to
do very much.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.700
First, you have to declare what
your service app can do.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.980
What functionality
do you expose?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.040
We have high-level verbs such
as picking, editing, sharing

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.240
that you say, this
is what I can do.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.670
After that, you just
accept the payload

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.850
data from the client.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.240
And perhaps do some
manipulation, perform the

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.710
function that you said you can
do, and then potentially send

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.560
data back to the client.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.340
So as you can see here, we
have two solutions for

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.380
integrating with Intents.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:52.530
The first is what you can
get in the current,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.320
stable version of Chrome.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.770
Right now, Chrome apps can
register that they handle

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.160
Intents using their
app manifest.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.290
So we have an Intent section
which you can list of the

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.970
different intents that
you can handle.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.460
We have the action of saving,
we can save types of images,

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.260
and we've got a couple other
attributes which I'll talk

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.339
about later.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:14.950
One of the cool things that we
can do-- and Paul talked about

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.869
this a little bit--

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.660
with Chrome app Manifest, is
that we can use the Chrome web

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.750
store to sort of curate and
expose these services, these

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.520
applications to the browser when
the client requests some

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.550
functionality.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.810
So, as we view Save here.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:33.210
If a client ever says, I need
a save service, we go to the

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.690
Chrome Web Store and say, hey,
give us a list of potentially

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.470
the high-ranking services that
provide, say, functionality.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.140
And then we can show this to the
user, even if they don't

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.080
have these applications
installed.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.110
So it's really good
for discovery for

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.950
the user, as well.

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:53.080
But in the web, it's not really
great if only Chrome

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.250
Apps can handle Intents.

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.940
We want this available
everywhere.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.640
So you'll see at the bottom
here, we've got this new HTML

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.760
tag-like thing.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.070
Well, that's exactly
what it is.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:04.460
This is the Intent tag, which
we've introduced as a proposal

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:08.240
for the addition to HTML, which
will allow all web pages

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.430
to register their service,
their page, as a service.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.990
So let's go into a little bit of
detail about the attributes

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.880
that you want to be able to
choose for your service.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.890
The first major one is the
action that you can handle.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.320
So you'll notice here that we've
got webintents.org/save.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.720
That's a URL.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.110
To be fair, the spec states that
the action is actually

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.120
just a string literal.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:35.860
It could be any string.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:38.280
But we feel it's really
important to set precedents

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.060
with URLs for a couple
of reasons.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.560
The biggest one is that
documentation.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.600
Paul, thank you.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.990
So, here we have
webintents.org/save.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:52.720
This site says exactly how you
should call, as a client, this

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.940
action, and what you need to do
as a service to implement

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.810
this functionality.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.040
It shows the inputs that you may
receive for this section

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.650
and outputs as well.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.050
We've also got a nice little
way to demo it here, too.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.080
So we are demo-ing the save.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.650
We have Cloud File
Picker installed.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.430
It's pretty neat.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.650
Yeah.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.830
We have these high-level actions
that we provided on

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.080
WebIntents.org.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.860
Things that we think most
applications will want to

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.860
integrate with.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.210
But let's say that you have your
own application, and you

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.990
have some functionality that's
very compelling that you want

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.630
other sites to be able
to use, other clients

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:31.560
to be able to use.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.060
Well, you should be able
to expose that as well.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.630
Let's say that my web
page is example.com.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.160
So I have some functionality,
let's call it transform.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.160
So I want to share this
with the world.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.580
So my action will be
example.com/transform.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.320
Developers can go to that
URL, where you have the

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.900
documentation for this action,
the inputs and outputs that

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.250
you need, and clients can
integrate with this.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.500
We have a much better world.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.970
The next attribute we'll want
to talk about is the Type.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.970
So the Type is the type of
data that you can handle.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.200
For the Save action, we're
saying we handle

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.300
saving types of images.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.500
And I'll go into a little bit of
detail about what the type

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.300
actually means.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.150
Here, we have a MIME type.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.640
Images with wild carding,
in fact.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.920
So we're saying we can
handle all images.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.630
But you could also list an
array of MIME types.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.810
So let's say you edit images,
but you don't want to say to

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:30.990
the world, I can handle editing
all types of images,

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:32.580
because there might be some
formats that you don't

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.480
actually handle.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.900
So you could specify a list.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:40.710
Say, image/ping, image/jpg,
and probably image/bitmap,

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.456
though I don't know who
would be using that on

00:20:42.456 --> 00:20:43.706
the web these days.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.670
Note that, while you can use
MIME types, you can also use

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.540
string literals here, too.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.410
I don't know if you've ever
heard of schema.org, but

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:57.360
schema.org is this sort of
next-generation semantic web

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.830
where they expose nouns.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:05.850
Schema.org/imageobject is a
reference for what an image

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.250
object might actually contain.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.820
Attributes about images.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.810
So you could say, I don't want
to specify MIME type, I want

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.910
to specify schema.org/image.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:17.540
And then clients and services
will integrate around this

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.820
point on schema.org.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.990
It doesn't have to be
schema.org, it could be any

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.640
string literal.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.330
But you can see it's really
expandable to whatever you

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.810
need to use here.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.300
So these next two attributes
are going to

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.650
talk about are optional.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.040
And I'll go into a little bit of
detail about what it means

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.530
if you don't actually
specify it.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.150
So href is the page that's
actually going to be invoked

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.550
by the browser whenever your
service is invoked.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:46.500
So for this Save action, we're
saying, don't open my main

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.960
page, my index.html,
if you will.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.980
Open my save.html, which is the
page where I have specific

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.590
functionality to handle
this service.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.060
So on the Intent tag, it's
important to notice for web

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:04.120
pages that the intent tag will
say, save.html off of your

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.200
domain where you're
registered?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.550
So you could have users visit
your main homepage and

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.510
register for services at all
these different pages off of

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.680
your main site.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.180
It is same origin, for security
reasons, obviously.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.970
So you can't go register for
ABC.com, some service there,

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.220
to send them Intent data.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.700
Last attribute we're going to
talk about is disposition.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.800
So currently, we have
two dispositions

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.660
that you can specify.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.790
We feel that services know
best how they should be

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:36.210
displayed, whether you want to
take up maximum screen real

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:38.490
estate or you feel
it's good to be--

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.710
your UI's very concise and small
and maybe you want to

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.230
have reference of the page,
the client page.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.460
So, one of the dispositions
you can use is window.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.090
Window, in the Chrome browser,
at least, opens up your

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.860
service in a new tab.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.290
This is really important, like
I said, for when you really

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.960
want to maximize screen
real estate.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.510
An image editor, for example,
really should not be

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.850
constrained to a small window.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.050
You want to make the
most of that.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.750
We also have the inline
disposition.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.120
And in Chrome, the inline
disposition actually shows up

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.160
in the Pick your UI.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.080
So once you select, say, Shorten
with Google, then you

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.090
see the service actually show
up inside this picker.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.690
The picker will mold to the
size of the content.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.260
And we think this
is important.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.140
For example, when you need to
have the context of the page

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:24.490
underneath.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:28.810
For example, if you have a blog
post and you want your

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.180
user to share the blog post,
it's probably important when

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.580
the user is interacting with the
service, that they can see

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.110
the blog post underneath in
order to say, hey, this is a

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:39.490
really cool article.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.020
But please keep in mind that
it's not the client that gets

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.740
to say how the services open.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.540
The service is the one that
knows how best to be opened.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.960
So let's go to the
next major step.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.040
Once your service is invoked,
what happens then?

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.270
Well, the data is sent on the
window.intent object.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.110
And I'll talk about this here.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.230
You'll notice that we have
webkit prefixing.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.740
As we say often, this is still
an experimental API.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.230
It's still going through
the wringer in the

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.870
standardization process.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.820
And we want to make sure that
we're good web citizens.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.200
And so, as we're changing the
API, once we get to a more

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.700
stable version, we can drop the
webkit prefix once we have

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.940
other browser vendors
implementing this as well.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:26.460
And this is standard across
APIs that are evolving.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.810
So you'll see here that we're
switching on Action and Type.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.380
Now, if you're a simple service,
and you only register

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.660
for one piece of functionality,
one filter as

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.200
we call it, then you probably
don't need to do any switching

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.140
on the Action and the Type.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.840
You know what data is
coming, you know

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.900
what service you doing.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.370
But let's say you're more fully
function service, and

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.410
you've registered for
multiple filters,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.210
multiple actions and types.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.660
You're probably going
to want to switch

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.920
on how was I invoked?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.720
Which action am I supposed
to be handling?

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.780
What's the type of data
that's coming in?

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.770
So here, we're saving, and we
know it's a ping, so the

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.000
intentobject.data is the actual
data that's sent from

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.230
the client.

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:05.860
Let's check out a debugger that
can help us see what data

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.090
is being passed back
and forth.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.880
Now this is a nifty little
application that's available

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.350
on the Chrome Web Store.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.240
It allows you, whether a service
or client page, to see

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.760
what data is sent in from
Intent invocation.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.440
So we see, that when we invoked
this intent on the

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.220
page, we use the Save action and
we passed in the type of

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.110
URI listing.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.560
And here is the actual data,
which is that link.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.410
It's really nifty to be able to
debug and make sure that,

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.560
as a client, you're sending
the right data, and as a

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.780
service, if there's something
going on, you're not getting

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.520
the right data, you could
say, here's exactly

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.730
what's going wrong.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.650
Now this is a Chrome

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.080
application, it's pretty nifty.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.680
But long-term, longer down the
road, we'd really like to add

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.320
this functionality to
the Web Inspector.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.990
Maybe through an Inspector
extension.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.130
Thank you, Paul.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.810
So we've talked about one
side of the coin.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.320
Let's flip it.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.030
How do you actually invoke
Intents as a client?

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.130
It's really simple.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.330
You construct an intent object,
passing in the action

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:09.250
and the type and perhaps the
data that you want to send to

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.200
the service, and then you
call startActivity.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.070
That actually invokes the flow
of Intents in the browser.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.620
The picker UI will show up, as
you've seen in a couple times

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.740
that we've demoed.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.070
The list of services that match
this filter on action

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.370
and type will show up.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.220
And the user gets to
pick their choice.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.070
Which service do they
want to use?

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.830
And you're done.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:32.970
That's all you have
to do as a client.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.190
It's ridiculously easy.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.480
So we talked about one-way
communication.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.700
You send data from the client
to the service.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.480
But we need to be able to
transform data, we need to do

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.030
able to send data back.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:46.810
We can do that.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.160
We can have bi-bidirectional
communication.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.110
So the API has two optional
callbacks, onSuccess being the

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.370
most important, which
is your 90% case.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.490
When things go well
with the service.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.790
This is the way the service will
send back data and how

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.800
you receive it, the onSuccess
callback back So as a service,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.420
you call the postResult method
on the intent object that you

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.250
were sent in.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.020
The intent object
being the link

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.530
between you and the client.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:13.570
And you're probably going
to pass on the

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.220
data to this method.

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.900
There's also a non-failure
method, in case

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.760
something goes wrong.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.950
It could be sent from the
browser, say there was a 404

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:23.370
with the service that
was picked.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:26.420
Or, it could be sent from the
service in case perhaps the

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.240
data you sent from the client
didn't quite lineup, didn't

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.970
quite match what
they expected.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.030
I mean, to be fair, we want
this case to never happen.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.100
In well-behaved applications,
there are no failure states.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.580
But you need to be realistic.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:39.830
There are going to
be failures.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.270
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.600
So we went over the
basics of the API.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.240
The ability to start and invoke
and action, and then

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.340
the ability to actually respond
to that and deliver

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.940
the data to the user in the
format that they want inside

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.920
the other application,
and bring it back in.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.210
So let's talk about how we can
build applications that love

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.780
each other.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.650
How we can actually take this
basic API that we've just

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.910
shown you, and actually solve
the problems that we talked

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.970
about at the beginning
of the presentation.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.770
So the first one
is pick, right?

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.740
And we have a pick intent,
http://webintents/org/pick.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.320
We try to think of it
as, like, the file

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.570
opener to the web.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.550
Normally on desktop
applications, we'll have a

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.280
File, Open menu where we'll be
able to scan the hard drive.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.050
We should be able to pull in the
data from any web service

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.510
across the web that supports
the pick intent.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.300
So let's have a quick example.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.940
We'll pull in from the webcam.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.150
So we got a little application
called Quicksnapr.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:41.140
We're going to ask able to
wave, if that's possible.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.290
That's it, cool.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.950
Thank you very much.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.140
And then we click on it,
bring it through.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:47.850
Cool, right?

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.560
My presentation is not
an application.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.760
It shouldn't have to have
complex file open

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.650
functionality just to be
able to bring that

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.730
data into this app.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.290
And likewise, Quicksnapr, it
shouldn't have to know about

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.770
my presentation's integration
with its services.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:01.950
So we've just brought
the data back in.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.510
It's pretty cool, right?

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.140
As you've seen from the code
earlier on in this

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.970
presentation, there's three
or four lines of code.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.390
The ability to instantiate a
webkit intent object or an

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:14.920
intent object, the data that
you want to use, the action

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.970
type, and then the
startActivity.

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:19.990
The startActivity
has onSuccess.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.840
OnSuccess just basically takes
the data back in and then

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:24.340
attaches it to an image.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.720
And that is pretty
much all it does.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.750
We cache the image for related
use in some of the next

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:29.290
slides, and you'll
see what happens.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.760
But what I what really want to
show you guys is actually this

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.650
is the set pattern.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.970
The same pattern across every
single action that we're going

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:36.890
to try and do.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.100
And hopefully this will show
you how simple it is to

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.810
integrate with this API.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.230
So we've picked an image.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.120
We need to edit it.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.730
We need to maybe create an
inspirational message for the

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.820
rest of the world.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.430
So let's use another demo
application we've made called

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:50.820
Inspirationmator.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.550
And all it does is it creates
those inspirational photos.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.430
It's not very complex.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:00.010
It doesn't tend to be like
Photoshop or Pixelmator, or

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.040
any other type of application.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.755
It just adds inspirational
text to photos.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:08.680
Cool.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.660
JAMES HAWKINS: All right.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.335
Let's go back up.

00:30:17.335 --> 00:30:18.585
PAUL KINLAN: We need to
get off the screen.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:23.310
Click on it, and then--

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.000
Sorry about this, guys.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.828
JAMES HAWKINS: There we go.

00:30:26.828 --> 00:30:28.070
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.040
So that's pretty cool, right?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.690
We've had two applications
just talk with my

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.640
presentation.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.630
That's pretty cool.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.700
And if you look at the code,
it's exactly the same, apart

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.040
from, this time, we've change
the action to Edit.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.990
So that means we're going to try
and find applications that

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.220
support the ability
to edit images.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.230
And once the browser's found
them, it could be any type of

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.490
application, it doesn't have
to be Inspirationmator.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.180
If the user hasn't got it
installed, they're not going

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.580
to see that on the list unless
it's one of the suggestions.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.580
But we've managed to tend our
data out, edit it, and then

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.980
bring it back into our app.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.190
And again, it's the same code.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.930
We have an onSuccess callback
which takes the image data and

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.055
then just attaches
it to this image.

00:31:01.055 --> 00:31:03.030
It's pretty cool, right?

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.570
So we've edited the data.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.210
We want to make sure
it's all backed up.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.670
So this is the Save intent.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.890
If you look at the code, it's
exactly the same again.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.380
Apart from this time,
we change the action

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.070
from Edit to Save.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.800
So we're going to ask the
browser to find a list of

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.250
services that support
image saving.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.470
So we're going to save back
out to Cloud File Picker.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.850
So you remember that we pulled
in before, earlier in the

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.660
presentation, from my
Picasa account.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.600
Well, we've actually just
saved it back out.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.040
So if we just click View, just
to prove it's saved.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.600
This is just using
the Drive API.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.850
It's just a JavaScript API that
we chose to integrate

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.930
with for this demo.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.900
But we've managed to upload
our application into the

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.940
user's cloud file storage
solution.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.020
And if we click on it, we should
be able to view it.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.270
And hey, there we are, right?

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:48.540
We've taken our data from one
application, brought into the

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.510
presentation, edited it in
another application, and then

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.040
saved it out to my preferred
cloud file storage solution.

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.290
It's pretty cool.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:01.800
JAMES HAWKINS: There we go.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.790
PAUL KINLAN: Thank you.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.440
And obviously one of the things
that you want to do is

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.730
you want to tell the world how
cool this image is, right?

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.350
So we want to share.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.950
Notice this doesn't have
an onSuccess callback.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.450
My ability to share my
data to a service--

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.370
I don't need to know that
it's been shared, right?

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.820
Sometimes you might want to know
that the action has been

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.530
completed successfully, but in
this case, I don't, because I

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.740
don't actually need it.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.790
So if we just share this image
out, we'll be able to share it

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:25.840
to a different service.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.710
We'll just share to Imgur.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:30.690
This is just using an API
integration with Imgur.

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:34.300
It's processing, we've saved,
and if we press the actual

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.140
link, we should, in theory, be
able to see it actually has

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.650
been push the web, and
we're not just kind

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.170
of making this up.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:41.830
So, OK.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.720
The user interface looks a
little bit hokey at the

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.110
moment, a bit crazy.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.260
It's going to change
and improve.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:47.680
It is an experimental API.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.260
And as we iterate on this user
interface, it's going start to

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:51.970
look really nice.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:52.750
JAMES HAWKINS: I want
to tell a little

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.080
anecdotal story about this.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.810
So, for the longest time, we
couldn't get UX support, And

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.450
we were like, huh, what
can we do about this?

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.740
Engineer-built UI.

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.580
We built this, and then they're
like, oh my God, you

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.480
release with this.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.240
Mocks, here you go, you have
all the mocks you need.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.400
So we are actually polishing
up the UI, sanding down the

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.170
rough edges, and this is
going to look really

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.470
gorgeous really soon now.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.960
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.775
This is a nice demonstration
of an inline intent.

00:33:17.775 --> 00:33:20.200
We still have the context of the
page that actually invoked

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.460
action behind, but we were able
to manipulate this image

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.840
inside this context.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.250
It's pretty cool.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.985
And, obviously, once you shared
it out, you've shared

00:33:28.985 --> 00:33:31.640
it out of the world, you
get users viewing.

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:34.670
If a user views a link right
now, they either download the

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.550
data or just kind of view
inside the browser.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.200
But what happens if they want
to use their preferred

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.400
application?

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.500
Right now, we don't have the
ability to say, open this

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.160
image with my preferred
application.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.500
But we have got some
experimental support for RSS

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:48.030
and Atom feeds.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.140
So I just want to show
you this, actually.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:50.700
It's pretty cool.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.430
So we have just a link
that is clicked.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.980
There's no actual API
that's invoked.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.380
The browser's detected that
actually, there's a content

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.660
type that I can handle via
the Intent system.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:01.600
So it opens up the picker.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.110
And we'll choose Feed Intent
Viewer, which is an

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.010
application that Mihai Parparita
wrote, which just

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.340
off is the same functionality
that you

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.630
would expect in Chrome.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.300
Obviously, most users aren't
developers, and they won't use

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.040
this extension and
application.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.980
They might use their preferred
feed reader, which is pretty

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.230
cool stuff.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.810
And we have some other
examples, as well.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.679
So these are intents that are
actually on the WebIntents.org

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.010
domain, and they manage
under that name space.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:27.090
We have Subscribe.

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.639
The idea behind this is, if you
have a URL that you want

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:33.489
to, not view, but subscribe to
regular updates from in your

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.880
favorite feed reader, well
that's just a simple action

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.830
that says I'm going to subscribe
to this feed.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.179
And then we have another
one for Shorten.

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:42.560
So the idea behind this is you
might have a link or some data

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.739
you want to compress.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:44.600
In this case it's a link.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.870
And we're going to shorten
it with the Google API.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.630
It's pretty simple.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.800
This doesn't look sexy because,
again, this is my own

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.739
demonstration.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.870
But we've taken our data from
one application, sent it using

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:59.050
the Google API, JSON API that
you can interact with, and

00:34:59.050 --> 00:34:59.770
saved it in this page.

00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:02.220
And obviously we click Return,
we should be able to see the

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.370
data come back in.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.960
So this demonstrates, even with
the inline context, you

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.780
can pass data in, manipulate it,
and bring it back out to

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:09.900
you application.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.050
It's pretty cool, I think it's
pretty powerful stuff as well.

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.900
JAMES HAWKINS: So far we've
talked about a lot of

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.250
high-level integrations.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.160
We've got the input and output
of data going on.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.320
But there's more advanced

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.680
communication we could be doing.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.330
Let's say that you're a
photo storage site.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.880
You have users who have very
large raw photos, perhaps 50

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.590
megabytes, and your site
does not have editing

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.380
functionality.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.430
Which is fine, because
we have Intents.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.990
There are services out there
that will allow your user to

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:44.190
edit the image and pass back
the manipulated bits.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.940
But what we have to do, we have
this blob, and that's

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.760
going to be copied.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.790
It's 50 megabytes of data, it's
going to be copied, even

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:54.240
client-side just to the other
service so that they can have

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.110
the bits as well.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.890
This is not cool.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.190
Now we have a slow copy, a
slow synchronous copy.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.400
We have a service and a client
that both have a

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.930
copy of the same data.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.200
We want to solve this problem.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.020
So we can which transferables.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.680
We can transfer this blob.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.430
What transferables allows you
to do is say, I have a large

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.410
set of data.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.850
Just pass a reference.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.780
We don't need to pass the
entire set of data.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.560
The browser has a copy of the
data, just send a pointer to

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.470
it and say, this is where
your data is at.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:24.410
The service that's editing
the image can perform the

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.680
manipulation on the bits, and
then return the result

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.400
transferred once again back to
the client, and the client has

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.200
the edited data.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.300
No copying whatsoever,
just transferred.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.180
Very fast.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.880
Another important advancing you
can do with Intents are

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.220
explicit intent.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:44.910
So your application may be
very well componentized.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.850
You've got little bits of
functionality here.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:53.830
Say, an email application has
composing emails, it has--

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:57.090
what else do we have, Paul,
in email applications?

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:57.890
Reading emails.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:36:59.435
You've got a reading
email view.

00:36:59.435 --> 00:36:59.710
PAUL KINLAN: Download.

00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.930
Save.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.620
JAMES HAWKINS: You've
got the inbox view.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.170
And some of these things could
be shared with other

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.560
applications, such as
composing an email.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.040
That could be a form of
sharing, if you will.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.940
So you have registered for
Intents that you are a service

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.710
that handles sharing with your
Compose functionality.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.460
But you can also call yourself
this way with the Intents API.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.710
You could say, example.com, say,
which is my own service,

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:26.430
and call into your
own components

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:27.780
using the Intents API.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.100
So let's say you're a client,
and you have some very,

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.760
perhaps, obscure action that
you need performed on your

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.150
data, or that you want the user
to be able to select.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.910
But you don't want to have a
situation where the picker

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.010
shows up as empty.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.200
Let's say we're in a world where
web pages can register

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.060
for Intents.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.480
There are no Chrome applications
that can handle

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.760
this action.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.580
You want to make sure that the
services that you know about

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.800
that can handle this action
are available to the user.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.290
So we have suggestions, which
allow you to say, I know

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:05.170
example.com and another example

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.510
can handle this action.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.420
So pass those in and show them
to the user to give them a

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.740
choice to select
these as well.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.700
The alternative solution to the
problem of having an empty

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.980
picker, which is a horrible UX
experience for the user, is

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.040
having a way to say, is there
anything in the picker?

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.730
Is anything going to show up?

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.110
Are there services registered
that handle this action?

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.270
That's a no-no on the web,
because that allows

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.310
fingerprinting the user.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.520
We didn't want to introduce
this to the web.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.760
So we have suggestions here
for that use case.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.430
So do for apps what links
did for the web.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.140
Greg Billock said that.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:40.960
Who's Greg Billock?

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.390
I know.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.340
Now you're asking her.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.360
Greg Billock is one of the lead
engineers on Intents.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.500
He's right here in
the front row.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.390
Yeah.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.580
He's going to be doing a code
lab this afternoon, with

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.760
Rachel as well, which'll
be very interesting.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.110
But what's important to think
about here is that links are a

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.810
one-to-one communication.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:58.690
And that's what the
web is today.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.040
Web Intents allow scaling to the
size of the web, where you

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.960
have one to "n." Your client
to many services.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.570
And the most important thing
is that those "n" services

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.870
that can be chosen are
picked by the user.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.990
They say, I like this site.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.010
I like this service.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.730
And I don't want to deal
with anything else.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.180
There are 300 sharing
services out there.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.400
Probably more that we don't
even know about.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.580
But the user only cares
about three of them.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:26.830
Only show them the services
they care about.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.380
And Intents lets us do this.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.760
It's also extremely
easy to use.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.510
I feel like we've been showing
the exact same code for all of

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.830
these slides, almost
as filler, right?

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.150
But it's to say, it's
so easy to use.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.520
It requires very little cost for
developers to integrate,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.230
both on the client side
and as a service.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.640
This is very important
for integration.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.780
We want this ecosystem
to build up and to be

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.030
useful for the user.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.260
PAUL KINLAN: So we're pretty
much finished now.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.430
We do have some more
information, though.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.400
So we have a selection
of links.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.440
We have the W3C specification,
which is, like we said, in

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.330
first public working draft
at the moment.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:06.710
You can go in there, if you
really want to know the

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.210
nitty-gritty about the API,
you can go there and

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.150
understand everything
that's happening.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.280
We also have some high-level
documentation.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.530
That's the whole point of
WebIntents.og and all the

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.140
actions underneath that, is
that we can provide more

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.030
developer-friendly documentation
about how you're

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:22.730
supposed to interact with these
services, and examples,

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.830
demos, and a whole lot
of other things.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:27.940
We also have a Google+
Web Intense account.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.950
So it's +Web Intents.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.780
If you just want to follow it,
we'll be doing updates.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.660
We'll be sharing these slides
at the end, as well.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.360
But also, if we find any great
applications, tutorials, and

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.840
articles, we'll share that
through there as well.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.770
Because we want you, as
developers, to be able to

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.990
understand what the rest of
the ecosystem is actually

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:44.200
building and doing through
this system.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.310
Likewise, there's a high-level
discussion group.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:51.250
It's not the specification
discussion group, if the

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.830
application developers
discussion group.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.970
So if you want to know how to
integrate with Save, maybe to

00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.130
save a Word document or
something similar, and you're

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.750
having troubles, and you want
to find out whether other

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.820
developers are doing something
similar, that's

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.620
the place to go.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.510
Because that'll be application
developers inside that space.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.460
And likewise, with every single
demo that we've seen

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:10.340
today, they're all open-source
and available on github.com

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:14.150
under /PaulKinlan/WebIntents,
so you can go and play.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:15.020
We do have a code lab.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.550
So I actually do want
to ask one question.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.040
Is everyone excited
about the API?

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.425
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:21.180
JAMES HAWKINS: All
right, Sweet.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.620
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.300
Thank you.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.570
So, we do have the code lab,
as James said before.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:31.820
It's 1:45 to 3:45, code lab room
one, where Rachel Blum

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.880
and Greg Billock will actually
take you through the API if

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.340
you haven't got an
application.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.600
However, if you do have web
applications that you want to

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.890
integrate with Intents, come
and speak to us, and we'll

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:42.000
show you how we think you should
integrate that into the

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.900
Intents system.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.230
So we want to get this really
cool ecosystem going, and

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.210
we're there to help you guys.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:49.950
We've got a whole lot of other
technical assistants.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:53.315
And just before I finish, this
is a family thing for me.

00:41:53.315 --> 00:41:54.620
It's my son's birthday today.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.970
So I'd just like to say, happy
birthday Benjamin!

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:00.090
Sorry I couldn't be there,
I'll be there later.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.536
And everyone's going to
sing Happy Birthday.

00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:03.940
No?

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.790
OK, maybe later.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:08.860
So anyway, thank you.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:12.620
So we'd like to go forth
and intentify.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.980
That's my joke, and I'm
very sorry for this.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:17.090
Likewise, we have the Web
Intents Google+ account.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.880
We are both on Google+ as
well, under our names.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.540
If you have any questions,
comments, or feedback, we'd

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.950
just love to get as much
as you want now.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.860
Either here, outside in the
hallway, or we'll be in the

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.370
office hours area as well
for a couple of hours.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.620
Thank you very much.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.365
JAMES HAWKINS: And we are
open for questions.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.710
AUDIENCE: Is there a way to
whitelist or blacklist the

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.760
items that show up?

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.880
We make medical software,
and so, in the US, there

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.310
regulations about privacy.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:56.180
So we couldn't just open it up
for any application to share.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.710
But there are unknown number
of ones that would be

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.612
acceptable.

00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:00.950
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.940
Not actually directly
inside Chrome or

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.400
the Chrome Web Store.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.730
The actual list, the main list
that you see, are only

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.860
applications that you've
directly installed.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:12.490
So we don't have a policy
at the moment inside

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:13.680
Chrome for Chrome OS.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.170
JAMES HAWKINS: So you
could use explicit

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:16.200
intents for that purpose.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.740
If you know the list in advance,
you can make use of

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.150
the Intents API in order to call
them directly, especially

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:24.330
if that list is small.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:25.648
And suggestions as
well, right?

00:43:28.576 --> 00:43:29.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.550
One thing.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:34.470
The list of intents that you
could call was basically the

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.440
list of applications that you
had installed that replied to

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:36.920
those intents.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.650
But how would that go
for web intents?

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.650
For intents that are
on the website?

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.830
Is there some form of discovery,
like the sites you

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:44.870
visited that--

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:45.250
JAMES HAWKINS: Exactly.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.390
That's exactly what it is.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.690
So we feel that the user
visiting a site is a very

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.090
strong signal.

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.430
One, of many, that they
want to have this

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.660
available as a service.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.540
And we also think we're going
to have to be smart about

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.410
heuristics to say, what
services does a

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.200
user want to see?

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.210
So you're exactly right.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.530
And as the user's browsing
around, there could be a

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:06.710
problem where they just
aggregate all these services,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.910
and they don't care about
most of them.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.980
We think it's really up to the
browser, and we're going to

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.930
try to do the job of this
to make it a great user

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.180
experience and to understand
exactly what they want to see.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.580
We also have the malware
database, the safe browsing

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.980
database, that we can use to
say, this is spam, this

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.760
service should definitely
not be seen.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.200
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.204
Thanks.

00:44:28.204 --> 00:44:28.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.780
I'm kind of new for this field,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:34.210
and I have two questions.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:40.480
One is, can you show a couple
samples of how the UI looks

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.990
like for the explicit
and suggest intents?

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.450
JAMES HAWKINS: So I can talk
about explicit intents.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.670
For explicit intents, the
picker does not show up.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.250
It will go directly
to the site in the

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.300
disposition that they want.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.750
So if it's Window, it will
open in the new tab.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:57.620
If it's Inline, will show--

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.570
you saw the service pull down,
and it will just be

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.184
displayed in there.

00:45:01.184 --> 00:45:02.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:09.130
The other one is so are there
any other objects which can be

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.100
used for to startActivity
function?

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.000
JAMES HAWKINS: For Share?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.230
AUDIENCE: For the
startActivity.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.920
JAMES HAWKINS: Oh,
startActivity.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.990
JAMES HAWKINS: It's just the
intent object and the

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.070
parameters as specified
in the API.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.210
AUDIENCE: Because the name
is it more generic.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:24.670
StartActivity.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.890
JAMES HAWKINS: Right.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.800
So the name actually came from
Android Intents, which Web

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.960
Intents is based off of.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.370
And we felt it was important
for a developer mind share

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.410
that we have an entire ecosystem
of apps built on

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:39.170
Android Intents, and that's a
large developer base of people

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.280
that know Intents.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.300
So as we were developing this
API, we said, let's pick and

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.410
pull pieces that we think are
important from Android Intents

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:48.730
that people will be used to.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:52.230
The name is almost kind of--
it's not arbitrary, but there

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.030
are multiple things we
could have picked.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.130
Thanks a lot.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:03.140
AUDIENCE: So on Android Intents,
I find that sometimes

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.820
I find the list is so long,
because the action is so

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.850
generic, like Share, that it's
cumbersome for the user.

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.980
So going back, kind of, to
heuristics, do you have the

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.260
intent to let the user select
a default intent for

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.490
a given MIME type?

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.700
JAMES HAWKINS: Yeah.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.830
That's one thing that we are
diverging from Android Intents

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:23.960
as it stands now, which is
to have smart defaulting.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.860
And we're working out the
kinks on that now.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.740
Actually, I'm going to point
and embarrass her.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.980
Rachel is actually owning
that functionality.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:32.513
The red head down here,
you'll see here her at

00:46:32.513 --> 00:46:33.810
the code lab later.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:34.190
RACHEL BLUM: Sorry.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.390
JAMES HAWKINS: No, no,
no, no apologies.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:36.120
We're working on it.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.090
So it should be out
in probably maybe

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.200
our next stable release.

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:39.440
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.320
And the stuff you showed us
today, is that from Canary?

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.240
PAUL KINLAN: Stable.

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.100
I was on Canary, but most of the
API's already in stable.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.500
JAMES HAWKINS: It looks
like on stable, the

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:48.460
latest stable release.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.750
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.160
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
prognosis on when we will be

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.140
able to use Web Intense
in major browsers?

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.120
JAMES HAWKINS: It's
difficult to say.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.360
So, we're working with all the
other browser vendors through

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.020
the W3C in the standardization
process.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.760
And that conversation is very
vibrant, lots communication on

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.910
the public Web Intense mailing
list, which is where all this

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.020
is happening on the W3C.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.160
So I think, in order to get a
better feel for that, a gist

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.310
of it, I would probably
join that mailing

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.350
list and see for yourself.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:23.090
PAUL KINLAN: We also do have a
JavaScript shim, which at the

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.400
moment is binary-compatible,
for other browsers.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.940
For instance, Mozilla, Firefox,
Internet Explorer 8

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.760
and upwards, and
Opera as well.

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.350
We don't want the shim to exist,
ideally we want better

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.380
solutions everywhere else.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.512
But we do have a shim to
replicate the functionality at

00:47:41.512 --> 00:47:44.050
the moment in other browsers.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.620
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.880
AUDIENCE: Will we see Web
Intents offered up by the

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.840
Android Chrome browser
as Android Intents?

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.440
JAMES HAWKINS: That's
a good question.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.320
We absolutely want to do that.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.450
It's much further down
on the road map.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.980
It's a very tricky
problem to solve.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:05.670
It requires work on both the
browser side and major

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.580
additions to the Android
side as well.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.590
So we're working on
those problems.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.620
It probably won't be out
for quite while, on

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:12.870
the order of months.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:15.960
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.180
Is it possible to customize
somehow to picking dialogue of

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.040
the applications?

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.610
Because if I have my application
and I have some

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:28.290
UI, I don't want to have
this now ugly dialogue.

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:28.720
JAMES HAWKINS: Yes.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.880
Well, I'll answer that
part of it first.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.260
We're trying to make
it not ugly.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:36.710
But we've always had this idea
that we can add an extension

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:41.960
API for an extension to
manipulate how the picker may

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.840
look or all the elements
on the picker.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.450
That's a tricky problem
to solve as well.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.770
We've got to make sure it's
secure, that the extension's

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.050
not mucking with things
in a bad way.

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.120
But we want to do that.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.139
That is also longer down
on the road map.

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.250
AUDIENCE: Will there be
some kind of API to

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.280
programmatically get a
list of [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.790
for given intents,
like an Android?

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:13.670
JAMES HAWKINS: Not
for the web.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.490
Chrome extensions and Chrome
apps obviously have elevated

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.980
permissions through
that system.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.160
That could be something that
we could expose there.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.730
But we definitely would not
allow that for the web for

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:24.980
issues of fingerprinting.

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:30.150
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
baked in for nice backwards

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.410
compatibility or
downgradability, or is that on

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.390
us to figure out?

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:36.770
JAMES HAWKINS: As far as?

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.450
AUDIENCE: Well for file picker,
I want to provide the

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:45.870
Web Intent capability in my
client, but if they're on a

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.570
browser that doesn't support it
or whatever, is it just on

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:52.190
me to detect and
build that out?

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.435
PAUL KINLAN: This is one area
that we were talking about and

00:49:54.435 --> 00:49:56.840
we still need to go through the
specification groups, is

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.680
how could we potentially
manipulate some of the

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.870
existing elements in HTML, like
file pick, so that you

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:04.970
could just say, I'm going to
pull a file in from the cloud

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.170
and then it goes that way.

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.100
I don't see it as
particularly--

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:10.260
correct me if I'm wrong-- but
I don't see it as trying to

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.920
make the existing API downgrade
to an existing pick.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.680
You'd have a pick that's
optimized and enhanced with

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.730
the Intents service,
if that make sense.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.790
JAMES HAWKINS: So there is
one thing you can do.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:23.130
You can check for
the existence of

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:23.800
AUDIENCE: Webkit [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.280
JAMES HAWKINS: --startActivity.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.870
Yeah, webkit startActivity.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.610
If it's not there, then the
API's not there for whatever

00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.885
browser is there.

00:50:30.885 --> 00:50:31.950
PAUL KINLAN: And modernizer's
got to check in

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:32.570
for that, as well.

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.240
JAMES HAWKINS: Modernizer,
yeah.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.240
There's also things that we're
adding to the browser.

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.330
We're trying to sort of
bootstrap the ecosystem in a

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.960
way by having the browser
be a client.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:48.210
So for picking files, we could
say, show the file picker so

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.150
you can pick something from
your file system, which is

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.360
provided by the browser.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.740
The user doesn't know that
it's not a service.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.880
It just works for them, right?

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.310
So we're trying to find more
points of integration in the

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:00.870
browser for it to be a client.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:01.447
AUDIENCE: Cool, cool.

00:51:01.447 --> 00:51:02.697
OK, thank you.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.810
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
do metrics collection?

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:15.200
Just figure out what intents
are more popular, or--

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.420
JAMES HAWKINS: We are actually
adding metrics through our UMA

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.700
API, our User Metrics
API in Chrome.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.730
We're not exactly sure yet, we
haven't quite designed exactly

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.920
what type of data we're
trying to get back.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:29.940
Obviously, bucketing
on the major

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.940
action types is important.

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:35.440
But our current API is limited
in that we wouldn't be able to

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.420
create buckets for things
we don't know about.

00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.180
So we're trying to think
through that.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.790
Let's see, maybe some service
that example.com created, the

00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:45.910
functionality that they create
is really popular.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.332
We'd actually like to
know about that.

00:51:47.332 --> 00:51:47.714
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:47.714 --> 00:51:48.096
OK.

00:51:48.096 --> 00:51:48.910
Thank you.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:50.920
PAUL KINLAN: The other side of
that is the actual Web Store

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.980
itself, it index and archives
every application that's got

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.410
its functionality declared
by the manifest.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.220
And if you click on, there's a
little link at the bottom of

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:03.640
the intent picker where
you can click

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.610
to find more services.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.230
You get a good education about
the usage and availability of

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:11.030
support services at least for
those types of actions.

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.600
AUDIENCE: So, related to that,
that would be where I, as a

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.350
developer, discover which other
applications are web

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.970
content enabled?

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:21.620
JAMES HAWKINS: Right.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.095
That's Find More Services
link that you'll see.

00:52:24.095 --> 00:52:24.370
Yeah.

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:26.820
And we show that whenever there
are more services than

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.740
we show in the picker.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:31.270
AUDIENCE: But if I as the
developer wanted, for example,

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.200
to integrate with Google
Calendar or other services

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.890
that might or might not
be Web Intent enabled.

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.800
Is there an easy resource
for me to access

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.130
to see which services--

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.990
PAUL KINLAN: Right now it's
through the Chrome Web Store.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:44.560
Through that area.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:46.900
One of my goals with the Web
Intents documentation was to

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.830
be able to, if we have the
index, the intent tag, is that

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:52.230
we can do queries on the
web, essentially.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:54.230
To then go, well these are the
list of service that we know

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.700
that support this, and
have it shown in the

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.480
documentation up front.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:52:59.540
We're way away from that
for the moment.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.680
The Chrome Web Store is
the way to go for

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:03.080
understanding what--

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.560
JAMES HAWKINS: Yeah, I mean
you can imagine this.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.060
Intent is really important for
the web, and we're here as

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.830
citizens of the web for Intents,
but we also work for

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.420
a search engine.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.600
A major search engine.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.640
So once the Intent tag is out
there, we have this ability to

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.410
crawl the web and say, who
actually supports Intents?

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:21.280
So I don't know if it's
something that we'll add to

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.810
search, or whether some
other crawl mechanism.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:27.600
But it would be awesome if we
had a database of sites that

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.740
support Intents that
was updated

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.060
automatically, et cetera.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.150
And you could go to their
sites and see what their

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:34.450
actions actually are.

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:34.870
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:36.870
Thank you.

00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:39.640
AUDIENCE: I think there is
currently a limitation in the

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.950
way actions are triggered.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.780
It only is by user movement--

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.410
JAMES HAWKINS: User gesture.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.860
But that leads to a problem
where, currently, you cannot

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.540
have them working with Chrome
extension that are actually

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.650
contextual menus or
just patterns.

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.510
Because even though they are
triggered by user action, the

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:02.070
window showing up is actually
not technically a user action.

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.730
Is it something that's
going to be sold, or?

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:05.020
JAMES HAWKINS: A bug!

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:06.270
You found a bug.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:07.740
I thought we had zero.

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.010
PAUL KINLAN: It's exists.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:10.710
The bug is open and
tracked by Greg.

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.630
We call it Bug Greg.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.070
It's a thing I want
to as well.

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:16.520
It'd be nice.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.520
AUDIENCE: Is the goal of
WebIntents.org to be sort of

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.920
authoritative source about all
the intents that are available

00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.690
out there, and is there
a submission process.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.810
What's that about?

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:27.230
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.990
So the idea behind
WebIntents.org is, when we

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:31.600
started this off before we were
going to go in through

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.330
the W3C standardization,
was it's not complete

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.290
authoritative, exhaustive list
of every single possible

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.660
intent that's out on the web.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.240
It's just a very core set of
use cases that we wanted to

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.890
try and solve right now.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:45.780
And as we saw more use cases
come in, we might take you

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.430
into the stewardship of
WebIntents.org and have that

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.290
as the de facto.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.650
However, it's quite early
on this whole ecosystem.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.330
So we might get a payment
solution, provided that

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.780
there's a pay intent,
for instance.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.350
And that becomes the de facto
standard that everyone uses

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.570
inside that URL.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.830
And that never comes under the
stewardship of WebIntents.org.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:06.220
It's under their stewardship
to maintain a standard and

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:06.810
everything.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:12.410
So I didn't personally want it
to be authoritative and index,

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.940
knock out every single thing on
the web and every different

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.520
type of intent, but it depends
on how the standardization

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:19.000
goes as well.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.060
Because the W3C we're talking
about maybe you should

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.060
formalize some of the actual
core intents right now.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.540
Get that whole process underway
through that group.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.910
AUDIENCE: So is there as
submission process currently

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:30.620
in WebIntents.org?

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:33.300
PAUL KINLAN: There is a
contributor's guide, where we

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.670
basically say, go to this
discussion group, we'll talk

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:37.790
about the different types
of use case that you

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:38.930
want to try and solve.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.100
And if we have at least one
client, potentially, and one

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.920
service that are going to be
able to do it and handle it,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.690
then we can probably try to
standardize it a little bit

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.560
more inside of WebIntents.org
But again, we haven't done

00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.770
that yet, because no one's
come to us with an idea

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:54.820
outside of use case we've
had originally.

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:55.650
JAMES HAWKINS: We're open.

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:57.670
And we'll see how it goes from
there, I think, is the answer.

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:59.530
JAMES HAWKINS: So there's
a site right now called

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:02.780
OpenIntents.org, which predates
Web Intents, and it's

00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:04.220
actually for Android Intents.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.900
And they have this database
on their site

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.160
which is really awesome.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.590
It was one of the big things,
when we started Web Intents, I

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:11.240
was like, aw, man, this
is really cool.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.830
We want services to come up with
all these functionalities

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.670
that we could never
even dream of.

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:17.960
And have a way that developers
can find them.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:22.010
So I think WebIntents.org may
eventually end up hosting some

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.590
database that lists these, and
there's an easy submission

00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:27.850
process that's very low
cost for developers

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.140
to add their actions.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.760
I mean, it doesn't really hurt
anyone for this database to

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.510
exist, as long as you have ways
to support and prioritize

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:40.710
and expose the best services,
or the best actions.

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:41.470
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.900
Are microformats a good
candidate for a type of thing

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.710
to use on Web Intents?

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:47.290
JAMES HAWKINS: Absolutely

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.100
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.780
PAUL KINLAN: You just have to
get the type right, and then

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:52.710
as long as the two services
agree that they can transport

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.205
the same data, you could pass
a blob of HTML through.

00:56:55.205 --> 00:56:58.410
And then both services
could parse it out.

00:56:58.410 --> 00:56:58.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.740
I have another question.

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.700
Is there a plan at some point
to use Web Intents

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.630
for the Chrome UI?

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.000
For example, the Print
button, could it

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.810
trigger a Print intent?

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.750
The star to favorite site
could be used--

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.110
JAMES HAWKINS: Absolutely.

00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:11.420
Yep.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.940
So that was what I was referring
to earlier, about

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.040
trying to find integration
points.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.530
Another one that we could do
very easily is, say, adding

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:19.630
things to context menus.

00:57:19.630 --> 00:57:22.110
So, if you know the context,
you know exactly

00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:22.660
what you can do.

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.740
Say you right click on an image,
there are a lot of

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.760
things you can do with images.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.770
And we can be smart about that
and say, all right, I want to

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.790
share this image, I want
to edit this image,

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.260
or save this image.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.250
And not just your hard drive,
obviously, but to

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:33.920
the cloud as well.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.630
So yeah, we want to add these
integration points.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:37.880
AUDIENCE: That'd be amazing.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:42.280
JAMES HAWKINS: Anybody else?

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:43.800
All right.

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.100
Thank you very much

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:46.350
PAUL KINLAN: Thank you.
