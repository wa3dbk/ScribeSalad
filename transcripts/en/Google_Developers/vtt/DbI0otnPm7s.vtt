LOUIS GRAY: Hi.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.350
I'm Louis Gray with Google
Developers Live, and welcome

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.730
to the second edition of Google
Developers Weekly-- our

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.510
highlight reel of what's
happening in the world of

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.010
Google Developers on
the set and off.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.710
Last week we kicked off this
show, keeping you on top of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.020
all of the events in our
studios worldwide.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.430
Let's go to the tape and see
this week's highlights, and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.610
preview the week to come.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.200
Google Drive and Google+ Photos
have always been good

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.860
friends, but it's now time to
take that relationship to a

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.299
brand new level.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.090
Ali Ashar took to the studio
to show us how photos in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.730
Google Drive are now
integrated with

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.690
your Google+ account.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.100
Also in the world of Google+,
Joanna Smith invited product

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.660
managers Tor and Joelle to
discuss the launch of the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.360
Google+ domain's API, enabling
companies and enterprises to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.990
develop tools for
their businesses

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.250
on the Google+ platform.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.320
Every single week, our team
from Tel Aviv takes a deep

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.180
dive into the world of APIs or
host experts from the world of

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.240
web and mobile.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.770
This Wednesday, Ido Green showed
how you can leverage

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.180
the power of NodeJS on Google
Compute Engine to pull

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.950
information from the Yahoo
Finance API, and work with

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.780
that data in Google Docs.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.370
This is just another cool
example of how open standards

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.610
can help different company
systems work together.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.380
Back here in Mountain View,
Jeremy Walker of the YouTube

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.170
team invited guest Vidyard
into the studio.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.310
If you create content on
YouTube, Vidyard can help you

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.390
turn your video content into
powerful marketing tools.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090
And after all, don't
engineers and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.960
developers always love marketing?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.650
The week in the studio wrapped
with the latest entry in our

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.670
Root Access series of growing
your start up and navigating

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.320
the world of venture capital.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.940
Don Dodge and Martin Omander
updated us on the biggest

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.100
trends from two of the hottest
incubators at Silicon Valley--

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.740
500 Startups and Y Combinator.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.760
Also, this next week promises
to be huge.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.510
Brian Fitzpatrick, better
known as "Fitz," will be

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.710
taking on three big
topics on GDL.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.870
First, organizational
manipulation.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.860
Then data liberation.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920
And finally, Google's
Transparency Report.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.670
I'll be fully transparent
with you.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.910
I'm looking forward to asking
him the tough questions on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.970
business politics, and just how
I can get all my data out

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.680
of Google if I want to.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.760
Here on GDL, we may not have
Shark Week, but we

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.840
do have Fitz week.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.060
Outside of the studio, Google
Analytics' Nick Mihailovski

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.880
introduced a new analytics
metadata API.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.920
Now you can find out which API
and which metrics can be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.960
queried from Google Analytics
core reporting.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.100
Check out our Google Developers

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.850
blog for more details.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.690
On our Google+ page, we shared
a post about the new Dart

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.230
Editor, which adds new
features and fixes.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830
The flashiest features, you
can now inspect classes in

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.850
running apps.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.290

dartling.org/editor.
