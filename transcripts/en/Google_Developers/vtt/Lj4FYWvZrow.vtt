00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:11.060
IDO GREEN: Hello, and welcome to
another episode of GDL-IL,

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.220
GDL Israel.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.400
Today we're going to have quite
a fun time with showing

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.700
the power of both App Script
and Compute Engine.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.700
And in order to show the
flexibility and ability to run

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.600
interesting test cases on both
platforms, I decided just to

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.560
take this fun subject of Monte
Carlo simulation and see how

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.100
we could utilize those two
different products in order to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.660
test it and see if we could get
some interesting results

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.540
to real programs that we
have under our hands.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.670
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen, and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.200
we'll jump together
into the code.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.400
I find it very useful in most of
the cases just to talk less

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.860
and see code.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.700
So let's move this one so we
won't have any problems, and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.150
we'll open this little doc.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.240
I guess the fonts are quite
large, but if we have a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.620
problem, just feel free to ping
me on the Hangout, and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.480
we'll be able to increase
the font size.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.990
Actually, I could
do it right now.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.000
So what are we having here?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.540
Basically, what we want to test
is to show the power of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.530
App Script, and we took the
fun world of Monte Carlo

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.990
simulations.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.910
Because when we have problems
that are happening in the real

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.070
world, usually there are quite
a lot of outcomes that could

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.100
come for each and
every scenario.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580
And what we're doing in those
simulations, basically we're

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.630
trying to identify the different
variables that we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.610
have under our hands, and then
run it many times with some

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.500
kind of random distribution that
allow us in end of the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.970
tests to come up with numbers
that harness us with the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.220
ability to fine tune and
to get an answer.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.150
And in our little case, we just
choose the option to help

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.980
a good friend of mine who is a
real a rock star salesperson,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.910
and we'll try to find what
are the things that are

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.280
constraining him and how
we could have been.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.560
How we'll do it?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280
Well, we'll use first App Script
just to show the power

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.710
of Google Sheets and App Script,
and how you could do

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.550
things quickly and share
them with others.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.330
And then we'll take it for the
real world, and we'll show

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.080
together how we could run it--
the same code, basically, the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.270
same JavaScript code--

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.640
on Node.js, inside Compute
Engine, which is a very

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.480
efficient way to do it.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.430
What is our problem?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.070
Well, basically we have this
brilliant salesperson, and

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.050
they could get big deals that
pay, let's say, x amount of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.400
dollars or smaller deals that
pay y amount of dollars.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.500
And of course, the level of
effort for a bigger deal is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.990
much higher than
a smaller deal.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.980
So let's take the scenario of
the end of the quarter, and

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.780
our salesperson got 30 days to
make the most out of her time.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.180
What she could do?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.200
She should choose just to
close big deals, or just

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.850
smaller deals, or what
is the perfect plan?

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.430
And this is basically what
we'll try to do here.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.760
I'll share all those links
at the end of the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.770
show, so feel free.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.730
A much better explanation than
the one that I gave you can

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
find on Wikipedia, then if you
want to check out what it's

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.030
all about with Node.js and how
cool it is to run your

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.590
JavaScript code inside it very
efficiently, of course.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.390
Node.js, but you need some
machine to do it, so Compute

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.260
Engine is here to help, and
we'll touch quickly on how you

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.340
could set your own
Compute Engine.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.090
Since we did it last episode
of GDL-IL, I won't touch on

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.010
all the basic boilerplate steps
that you need to do in

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.585
order to have your own virtual
machines, but I'll just take

00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:08.850
it a step further.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.410
After you have the machine, you
installed the Node.js, now

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.190
what you could do with it.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.420
And of course, App Script,
there's just a link to all the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.019
details and documentation that
you could enjoy there.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.330
Let's go to our case, and first

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.370
let's define the problem.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.980
So in our world-- let me just
open it so it will be a bit

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.620
wider, and we'll try to squeeze
everything to the page

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.530
so you'll be able to
see it nicely.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.570
Let's take it like this.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.610
That's much better.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.090
The chart here is just to give
us a sense of how the data

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.850
look like, so don't focus
too much on it.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.780
Basically, what we have
here is a test case.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.700
Let's remove all the data that
we have right now and look at

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.400
it together.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.240
If you noticed, I have this new
sheet that I created, and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.000
for this GDL show, I just
created a new menu that would

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.780
allow us to choose
several things.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.210
Let's try with the most basic
way to just run simulations

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.730
that basically you could see
are just filling now the

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.260
details, and the chart is
updating in real time.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.030
And what we have here is
a very naive approach.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.090
We're just coming with x amount
of big deals and y

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.120
amount of small deals.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.610
In our case, it's the
same amount--

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.750
25.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.680
And we have a number of
percentage that we set in

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.010
advance that says something like
in 30% of the deals that

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.980
she will approach that are big
deals, she will be able to

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.380
close them successfully.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.180
And let's say on smaller
deals, it's much easier

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.360
because of lots of different
reasons, and their percentage

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.990
there is 50%.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.800
You could see here on 10 cases,
more or less, those are

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.590
the numbers.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.120
And we could have a slight feel
for the numbers here,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.670
what is the max, min, standard
deviation, and the median.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.590
And a nice aspect here will
be probably to take the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.390
conditional formatting.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.750
I'm going to the cells that I
want to apply this conditional

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.770
formatting.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.650
In the conditional formatting,
we say something like, OK,

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.270
everything that is above
$250,000, I just

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.570
want to make bold.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.070
And in our case, the median is
265, so let's correct it.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.330
We go here conditional
formatting.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.990
And I could see now quite
quickly where more or less I'm

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:41.490
getting the best results.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.510
But this is, of course, not
mimicking reality, because we

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.710
won't be able to do the same
things, because probably a

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.640
bigger deal is taking
more effort from us.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.240
So we'll got the next phase of
running more control deals.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.720
And what will happen here,
you'll see, is we enforce the

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.160
assumption that a bigger deal
is taking actually twice the

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.730
time of the smaller deal.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.970
So now the script is done.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.330
You could see that I got this
nice dialog box, telling me

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.950
what was the max amount that
we are able to achieve.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.240
And I just confirm it.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.030
And here you could see quite
clearly that if we were able

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.630
to do one big deal, then from
the 50 deals that we could

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.020
achieve if we would focus just
on a smaller deal, now we

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.060
could have only 48, and
then it's going down.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.376
And here it's much interesting
aspect because we know that in

00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:34.480
the real world, it will be
much closer to this.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.620
We'll spend more time
on the bigger deals.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:43.690
And here the case when the
median is around 180,000, and

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.220
the average is 200.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.750
Let's see all the cells
that are above that

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.790
average quite quickly.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.930
Conditional formatting,
and above,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.120
let's say, just 200,000.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.710
And you could see nicely that
it's more concentrated at the

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.530
beginning of everything.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.270
Now, let's take it for the next
step to show what the

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.580
code is doing.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.990
Here you could see this--

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.150
let me make [AUDIO LOST]

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.120
that actually running
everything.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.480
So basically, we just took the
assumption of how easy or how

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.150
hard it will be to
close a big deal.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.350
And in our case, it was
20%, and then 50%

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.710
for a smaller deal.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.560
The amount of executions that we
could allow ourselves to do

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.100
on smaller deals and bigger
deals, and this is the returns

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.860
on each deal.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.630
And of course, you could play
with those parameters, and

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.570
those are the parameters that
will drive all the simulation.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.720
Later, what we're doing is just
running this scenario.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.570
And we're running this scenario
basically on all the

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.460
amount of big deals because this
is what's driving us or

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.490
constraining us from making
all the smaller ones.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.460
So what we will do, we'll call
this function of running

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.130
"blending," and this
is that function.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.440
And we're passing the right
line, so we'll be able to

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.580
update our sheet quite easily.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.550
And this is just bottom line for
all the parameters that we

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.230
want, all the variables
that we want to keep.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.490
And now we're calling the
loop of the big deals.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:17.900
And we're calling this simple
function that's returning the

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.200
randomization, or basically
the answer, if we were

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.270
successful with approaching
the deal and

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.530
closing it or not.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.390
And what this function does,
basically, it's very simple.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.480
We're just taking the random
function-- it will be a number

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.230
between 0 and 1--

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.660
and we're trying to
see if it was 20%.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.760
And if the number that we
got is lower, we were

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.920
able to win the deal.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.970
And if not, it's just false.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.540
And of course, the same with
the smaller deal, so it's

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.100
very, very simple.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.000
And when we're coming here, and
we want to test if we want

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.570
the deal, we're just going on
the deals, and it will start

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.910
with one deal, and
then increase it.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.120
And if we were successful and
it's true, we're just adding

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.120
one to the deals that we were
able, and we're adding the

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.250
money that this big deal will
put into our account.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.760
And of course, the same will be
done with the smaller deal,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.640
so the same simple code.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.310
The smaller deal, however,
the magic is here.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.010
We have two constraints here.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.110
One is that simple constraint
of smaller deal should be

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.305
always lower than the max amount
of smaller deals that

00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:25.500
we could do.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.900
But then we want to enforce the
ability of, hey, a bigger

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.700
deal is twice as hard-- that's
why it's 2 here-- than a

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.830
smaller deal.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.720
And the combination of two can't
exceed the max amount of

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.710
deals that we could allow
ourselves to small and big.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.820
After we do that, very easily,
we're just updating the lines

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.000
with all these different data.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.790
And those are these lines,
basically here.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.710
And very nicely, we could get
some nice aspect of what's

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:55.410
going on here.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.840
So you saw that with the
current parameters--

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.010
and let's have a look
at them again--

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:05.500
of 20% and 50%, and those are
the returns, it might be worth

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.690
to just focus maybe on this
range of deals, so to focus

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:17.980
on, let's say, something between
6 to 12, more or less.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.430
But if we're changing the odds
just a little bit, let's say

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.670
that we are more successful
with a bigger

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.370
deal, and it's 0.4.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.540
And we're coming again here.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.020
Let's remove all the data
so we start clean.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.860
And we're going again here and
running it, we'll get the

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.820
results quite quickly.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.840
But as you can see here, we're
waiting a bit, and that's

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.350
basically one of the things
that I wanted to note.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.800
If you need to run simulations,
especially for

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.490
the real world, App Script might
not be the tool for you.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.220
Here we're playing with it, and
it's a nice way to have a

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.980
feel for some aspects of the
data, but wait with me.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.170
Bear with me just two or three
minutes, and you'll see how

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.080
you could do it for real with
utilizing Compute Engine.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.050
So here we got some different
results, and you could see

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.190
here that the median
is higher--

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.170
270.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.700
And if we'll go here
[AUDIO LOST]

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.860
use the conditional formatting,

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.360
and we'll drive here.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.940
Basically, it should be 270.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.510
You see that it's tending a big
more to here, but it's not

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.640
very clear what's going on.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.100
And of course, if we'll play the
scenario again and again

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.220
multiple times, we'll be able
to identify if it's driving

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.770
more to this side and aspect
of the data or more to the

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.760
lower number of deals.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.050
Now, of course, here you could
play and run it multiple

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:58.050
times, and we could definitely
do that again if we want.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.912
One thing to note here is that
you have full ability to use,

00:13:02.912 --> 00:13:07.960
of course, the message box, but
also the logger itself.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.020
So you have the ability to go
to View, click on Logs, and

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.970
getting the output here,
very useful when you

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.290
want to debug things.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.860
But one of the even nicer thing
is just the ability to

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.980
put a break point on each
function and each line that

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.730
you wish, and then select
the right function

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.560
that we want to run.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.000
In our case, it's Run
Scenario Blending.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.480
Click on the Debug, and you'll
see in a minute that I'm

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.875
opening the debugger and getting
a full view of the all

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:38.610
the variables.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.910
I have this object containing
all the

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.190
variables that I have here.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:47.450
And now on this line, basically
I could see and go

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.590
above or get into and stepping
into the functions.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.150
Let's close it.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.200
We don't need it anymore.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.280
We have the results back.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:03.770
Let me just refresh it so it
will be much quicker, and

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.140
we'll get the results
in a second.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.050
And as you can see now, it's
maybe a bit clearer that we

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.880
want or wish to end to this
range of the aspect.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.770
Now, all this is quite cool.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.750
But the ability to run it for
real is basically coming very

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:29.610
handy when we're taking Compute
Engine into our hands.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.280
So I took the code
from App Script.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.782
Basically, you could
see it here.

00:14:34.782 --> 00:14:38.610
[AUDIO LOST]

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.270
changes into it.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.170
First and foremost, since you
are going to run in Node.js,

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.280
we could utilize some models.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.760
NPM is your source, and there
are so many, that it's quite

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.920
funny to look sometimes
for the best ones.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.150
In our cases, since we're
working with a lot of data

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:05.460
now, we get to get out of the
logger or, in our Node.js

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.930
world, Console Log.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.600
We want to work with files,
and here I just choose the

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.080
ability to work with text files
and basically build CSV

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.930
files that later on I could
upload and analyze in Google

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.170
Sheets again.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.990
So in our case, we'll try to
run, let's say, 1,000 times.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.985
We could do actually
10,000 times.

00:15:27.985 --> 00:15:31.100
It will be very, very efficient
and fast, and you'll

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.220
see it in minute.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.530
In terms of percentage and all
the aspects that we talked

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.960
about, very similar
to what we saw--

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.510
20% chance to close a big deal,
50% for a smaller one.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.090
And those are the limitations
that we put to ourselves, and

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.460
these are the returns.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.770
Now we're just putting some
boilerplate code to run our

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.920
blending scenario x amount of
times, and each time we'll get

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.160
the maximum, and we'll
want to output

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.170
everything to a CSV file.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.180
By the way, this is all
I need in order to

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.160
export it to a CSV file.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.860
I'm using outData as a string
object, and I'm just making

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.120
sure that I'm putting commas and
end of line in the end of

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.180
everything.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.750
And as you could see here, very
straightforward and easy.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:27.163
Now when we'll come here
to our Compute Engine--

00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:30.390
let me make it [AUDIO LOST].

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.960
we could run this little,
nice application.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:45.370
And for 10,000 runs, we got
the results back after 451

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.800
milliseconds, so roughly
half a second.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.430
And you could see here that we
were able to achieve the best

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.920
results with a higher
number of big deals.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.270
So probably the best
recommendation that we could

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:04.130
make in this case with
these assumptions--

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.530
these are the ones--

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.260
is that we want to focus
on more bigger deals

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.970
than smaller deals.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.940
Now you might notice that it's
not black and white, and it's

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:18.240
not that we have one
sort of thing.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.790
And I guess it's very similar
to the real world where

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.010
usually the answers
are quite gray.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.460
You need to find the
golden path.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.240
And in most of the cases,
it's not very clear

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.020
where they will be.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:38.160
And I guess that one of most
important aspects to note is

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.270
that your assumptions will
drive the simulation.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.770
So it's very useful to have
those type of simulations when

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.160
you feel that you have some
control or some assumptions

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.850
that are close to reality.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.100
And in our case, we could
definitely say something like

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.620
our brilliant salesgirl
could close a bigger

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.280
deal 30% of the times.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:17:59.580
Why?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.160
Because for every 10 deals that
she approaches, three are

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.720
done deals.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.980
And with those assumptions in
hand, we could definitely go

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.630
and see how she or he
could utilize their

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.570
time in the best way.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.610
So these were just fun little
things about how to utilize

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:24.810
Node.js, App Script, and run
some Monte Carlo simulations.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.000
I hope in the near future to
show some cool things that you

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.440
could do in App Engine
as well.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.630
And all the code, of course,
will be on my GitApp

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.160
repository, and I'll put a full
transcript of all this

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.940
show in the footnotes so you'll
be able to track it.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:46.400
And until next time, be
strong and have fun.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.650
Bye-bye.
