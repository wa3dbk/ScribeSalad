ERIC BIDELMAN: Welcome,
everybody.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.100
Thank you so much for coming
to Web Components.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.780
You're going to learn a lot
in the next 40 minutes.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.565
Thank you to everyone--

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:09.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:10.165
ERIC BIDELMAN: I haven't
started it yet.

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.050
You guys, you guys.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.920
You might not learn anything.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.980
You don't even know what I
have in this slide deck.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.237
So a little bit about myself,
so you know who's up here in

00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:18.470
front of you.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.870
My name is Eric Bidelman.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.430
I work on the Google
Chrome team.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.870
I'm on the developer relations
team there.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.980
We're going to talk about a lot
of stuff, so there might

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.160
not be enough time
for questions.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.750
Feel free, please, tweet at me,
Google+ me, come poke me

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.000
afterwards at Office Hours.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.200
So I have 40 minutes to cover
the future web platform, which

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.210
is a complete fail.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.310
We could talk about this for
three days straight.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.380
There should be a conference
devoted to Web Components.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.140
There's so much stuff now that's
starting to even land

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.310
in browsers that it's just
amazing, and I fundamentally

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.440
think it's going to change
the way we think

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240
about developing apps.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.250
This is what you're
going to feel like

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.110
for the next 40 minutes.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.980
We're going to throw a lot
of stuff your way.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.700
Boosh!

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.880
And then hopefully, around that
35 minute mark, you'll

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.980
have this moment of zen.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.280
Hopefully some of this stuff
will make sense, and you'll

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.010
really see where this
is trying to go.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.450
So if you've been following Web
Components, or this term

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.790
Web Components, even at a sort
of bird's eye view, what the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.660
heck are we talking about?

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.290
Well, we're talking about
custom elements in HTML.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.150
You can define a new vocabulary
for HTML.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.110
So the blink tag, for example,
is not dead.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.750
The blink tag is
alive and well.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.450
We can call it x-blink, and
all it is-- it's a custom

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.760
element that I've implemented
using CSS, and it just has an

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.020
opacity change using
transitions.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.160
That's kind of a
silly example.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.413
But you can do something like
the gangnam-style tag.

00:01:45.413 --> 00:01:47.340
[MUSIC - PSY, "GANGNAM STYLE"]

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.350
ERIC BIDELMAN: And that's
all it does, right?

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.765
A CSS action.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.860
So as a user of this component,
all I have to do is

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.380
include the gangnam-style tag
on my page, and I get--

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.790
[MUSIC - PSY, "GANGNAM STYLE"]

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.790
ERIC BIDELMAN: Of course,
there's more practical

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.680
examples, and maybe this one's
not practical either, but it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.419
not just defining new
elements in HTML.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.160
It's actually extending
existing.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.820
If you don't like the way the
native HTML button does its

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.750
thing, you can say a button is a
mega-button, and define that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.730
mega-button to do something like
on a CSS transition, have

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.472
this crazy gradient, and then
when you click it--

00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:26.240
[MOO]

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.840
ERIC BIDELMAN: It moos at you.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.260
So defining your own,
extending-- you'll see some

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.960
more practical examples, but
that's what this is all about.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.670
Being able to expand on
what we have in HTML.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.110
So when I think of
Web Components--

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770
so this ecosystem,
this umbrella

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.310
terminology for new stuff--

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.800
I think of four main areas.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.710
I think of Shadow DOM.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.050
This is sort of the foundational
glue, the mortar,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.140
this is how we get
encapsulation

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.500
for free on the web.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.280
HTML templates.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.090
So if you're going to build a
custom element, a widget, a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.730
component for your page, you
need to be able to scaffold

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.070
out sort of inert chunks of
markup, and then use those

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.720
later as people stamp
out your element.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.370
Custom elements brings
all this together.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.450
This is how you define a new tag
in HTML and put all these

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.320
lower level technologies
together.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.150
Think of that as your
Bat utility belt.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.910
And lastly, HTML import sort
of is used for repackaging,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.190
repurposing.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.630
If somebody writes this awesome
component someplace

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.650
over on the web, throws it up
on a CDN, I can then import

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.600
that into my page
and reuse that.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.930
So we have now this proper
notion of reusability on the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.520
web, which is awesome.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.430
So all in all, a collection
of new API

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.390
primitives in the browser.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.610
That's what I think about when
I hear Web Components.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.210
And we'll talk about each of
these in this presentation.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.020
So 40 minutes, and I have 36
to cover all this stuff.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.130
So HTML templates is
the first beast.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.100
This is really cool.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.020
With one tag, we now have
proper, like, at the browser

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.850
level, the ability to template
out a certain section of

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.310
markup to be a template.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.010
And this is great, because what
you put in this is just

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.890
DOM, right?

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.000
So I'm working with DOM, the
browser knows DOM, it's easy

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.740
to work with.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.370
That's really awesome.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.579
But the best part about template
is that it's parsed

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.470
and not rendered.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.280
And basically what that means
is that things like scripts

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.930
are not going to run.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.900
If I have a script tag in this
template, it's not going to

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.680
run until I actually stamp this
template out and use it.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
So that's really cool.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.700
Stylesheets and images aren't
going to load until I stamp

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.500
this template out.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.770
So that's great from a
resource perspective.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.480
You're not loading things in.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.770
If the user never sees this
template-- maybe it's a view

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.760
or something--

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.380
you're not actually going
to waste bandwidth

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.710
until you use it.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.640
And media's not played.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.580
So if you had a video in here
that had autoplay true, that's

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.280
not going to do anything until
you actually invoke and stamp

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.530
this template out.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.510
The other really nice property
about the template element is

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.410
that it's hidden from
the document.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.360
So that basically means you
can't traverse into it.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.870
It's in its own separate
little world.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.040
So for an example, if I try to
query selector in and try to

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.580
rip out that comment div that I
have in my template, I'm not

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.890
going to be able to do that,
because, again, it's in its

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.030
own sort of context.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.250
So it truly is a template that
you can use and reuse.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.470
And so how do we
use a template?

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.980
There's two ways.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.200
The first is there's a content
property on the template

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.660
element itself.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.410
And that'll just give you
a document fragment.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.570
So that'll just give
you a chunk of DOM

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.595
you can work with.

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:31.750
And the second is, if you want,
you can do innerHTML and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.330
work with that.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.260
So the process for using
a template--

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.460
clone it, grabbing that content
in any way you want,

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.690
stamp it out, and then that's
what activates it.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.780
That's what makes the stuff
inside of it go live.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.840
Then you see what's in it.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.520
So by default, it's actually
display none, right?

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.770
So a quick example.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.950
I have the same template
that I had before.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.220
Just a blank source and
an empty comment div.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.540
I can rip out the content
property.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.380
And this is a great example of
showing the dynamicism of

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.830
this, right?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.230
So I'm setting the
image source at

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.190
runtime, which is great.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.390
I can change a template as I
need to before I stamp it out.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.670
And then the last line
there is actually

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.920
where the magic happens.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.700
So I'll get that content, I'll
clone its node with all its

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.290
attributes, and that's what
makes that stuff go live.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.066
So at that point, this logo PNG
would be pulled down, if I

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:20.660
had stylesheets in the template,
they be pulled down,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.830
media would be playing
if it had autoplay.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.710
So clone, stamp out, and
then stuff goes live.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.510
Another example.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.380
So this is actually really
great, because it shows the

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.970
inertness of script.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.310
So if I refresh this slide deck
1,000 times, it's never

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.040
going to run this alert--

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.160
OK, thanks, bye--

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.630
until I actually stamp
the template out.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.830
So we'll do the exact
same thing.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.230
This time, I'm going to
basically just going to

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.150
increment this value.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.360
Every time I stamp it
out, an instance

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.150
is going to be created.

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:49.620
And then the script
will run as well.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.700
So when I press this
run button,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.170
hopefully that will happen.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.340
You'll see, OK, thanks, bye.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.970
That script is immediately
invoked when I stamp the

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.260
template out.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.330
And I'm showing how to
increment that value.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.880
So I'm changing the guts of
the template on the fly.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.880
So HTML templates are a
relatively new spec, actually,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.320
but support is actually coming
along really nicely.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.340
So Firefox already has this,
Chrome has this now, I'm

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.530
including Opera Beta Mobile on
this, because they recently

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.040
moved to Chromium.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.820
So very cool.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.080
Proper at the DOM level
HTML templates.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.390
Inert templates.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.910
So that's the first
building block.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.320
Quick introduction.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.720
Let's move on to Shadow DOM.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.100
So Shadow DOM is an absolute
complex beast.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.820
That's not Shadow DOM.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.850
This is also not Shadow DOM.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:39.350
This is a cool car that has
the license plate SHDWDOM.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.620
But what Shadow DOM
really is--

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.240
it gives us markup
encapsulation, it gives us DOM

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.140
encapsulation, it gives us CSS
style boundary protection.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.940
So if you're writing a custom
widget, if you're writing a

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.940
component, you want your
widget to look

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.530
in a certain way.

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.980
You've maybe designed
it to be that way.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.200
You don't want things bleeding
in or things bleeding out.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.830
So it gives us style
boundaries.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.670
And what it really does is it
exposes to us web developers

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.150
the same mechanics browser
vendors have been using to

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.716
implement their own
HTML elements.

00:08:07.716 --> 00:08:10.350
And so I mean by that--

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.820
you might also say, well, hey,
Eric, the web already has

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.450
encapsulation.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:14.920
It's the iframe, right?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.700
The iframe is great.

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.640
We can import third party
content into our page.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.460
But I would actually argue
it's super bloated.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.260
For this use case, it's
super bloated.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.060
It creates a new document
context, scripting into it is

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:27.740
very hard, you have to do
crazy postMessage hacks.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.540
If you want an iframe to shrink
wrap to your content,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.539
you have to figure that stuff
out in JavaScript, and it's

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:34.230
just a mess.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.909
And for the use case of
component on a page, it's

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.139
super bloated.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:43.039
But actually, what we have is
something lurking in the

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.370
shadows, no pun intended.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.200
And so there's a couple truths
here that I want to highlight

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.630
to you right now, and that's
that DOM nodes today can

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.440
already hidden DOM, and that the
hidden DOM that they host

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.680
cannot actually be traversed
into from our scripts.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.650
We can't actually navigate into
those or document course

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.760
lecture into them.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.170
There's a couple of pretty
good examples actually

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.110
implemented in the web platform
today, and those are

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.060
some of the more complex
input types.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.210
So input type date, or
input type time are

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.600
really great examples.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.550
With my keyboard, I can
navigate these, I can

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.220
increment these, so there's
clearly something going on

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:20.700
under the hood here.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.350
It's pretty interesting.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.640
I have a little increment
widget, and there's this

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.300
boom-- there's this calendar
picker under the hood.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.310
All I do as a user is declare
this input type date on my

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.190
page, and I get all this extra
goodness for free.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.630
So if I actually drill
into this--

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.920
I'm an interested developer.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.840
I want to drill into
the dev tools.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.830
You can turn on the dev tools
under the wrench here, or the

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.630
gear, show Shadow Dom.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.870
And so this is something
you turn on.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.880
And then immediately when I do
that, anything that has a

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.890
Shadow Dom in the web platform,
I can drill down

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.380
into that's going to have
this little triangle.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.700
Hopefully you guys can
see that here.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.810
And so the input--

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.570
there's a hidden document
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.670
There's a hidden Shadow DOM
attached to this input tag.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.150
And you can see what's happening
is that the browser

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.390
vendors have implemented this
tag, the guts of it, the

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.550
internals, using nothing
but markup.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.780
So they've used what we as web

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.410
developers have in our toolbelt--

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.490
markup-- they've implemented
that with their native widget,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.550
not using C++ but markup.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.880
I think it's pretty cool.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.480
But from a user perspective, all
I have to do on this page

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.552
is just declare this element.

00:10:32.552 --> 00:10:33.870
And there's other examples.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.440
Video tag has all these buttons
and stuff and sliders.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.300
Really cool.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.510
Textarea has a Shadow DOM.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.510
Details has a Shadow DOM.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.120
So all in all, the browser
vendors have been

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.380
holding out on us.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.520
Shame on them.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.662
But now they're exposing
this to us.

00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:48.830
They're exposing the ability
to create Shadow DOM.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.840
And so here's a quick example of
how to actually create this

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.640
Shadow DOM.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.450
I have my markup on the left
here-- my host element that

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.130
I'm attaching this
hidden markup to.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.710
And what I do is I just call
a query selector for that

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.540
element, and I call
createShadowRoot.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.620
So this is vendor
prefixed, FYI.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.620
So createShadowRoot, and in that
shadow root's inner HTML,

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.390
I'm just going to fill
in some markup.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.700
I'm going to put in an H2 that
says, yo, y ou got replaced.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.040
And I'm going to put in by my
awesome content just a div.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.350
And you can see what actually
renders, right, in that, once

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.860
I've attached that Shadow DOM,
is the Shadow DOM content.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.840
It's not this stuff up
here-- and we'll talk

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.120
about that in a bit.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.850
It's the Shadow DOM.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.630
The Shadow DOM rules all.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:29.870
And here's an alternative
view.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.810
This is what you would see in
the dev tools, for instance.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.320
You see that hidden document
fragment representing the

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.570
Shadow DOM.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.250
So one thing that's really
important if we're creating a

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.500
custom element is you want
some style protections.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.150
You want to be able
to style things.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.770
Things that aren't styled are
kind of unsexy on the web.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.810
So we have, with Shadow DOM,
the ability of style

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.750
encapsulation for free.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.150
This is one of the great
properties of it.

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.205
So in this instance, I'm using
the same sort of inner HTML

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:57.520
that I was before, the
H2 and the div that

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.250
says yo, you got replaced.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.900
But this time, I'm including
a style tag that's going to

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.330
color all of my internal H2s
red, which is exactly why you

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:08.940
see at the bottom that yo you
got replaced is now red.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.870
But this is really cool, because
I have an H2 at the

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:11.970
top of the slide deck, right?

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.530
The slide title's an H2.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.880
And that's not being styled
red, because again, style

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.250
encapsulation inside of my
Shadow DOM, inside of my

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:18.730
shadow root.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.540
Very cool.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.570
But we also have the ability
to control this.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.080
So if you're creating, again,
a component, and you want to

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.600
embed this thing on your page,
maybe you have a certain look

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.850
and feel that you want
to preserve.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.190
You don't want that thing to
look completely out of place

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:36.710
on your page.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.870
You want it to be seamlessly
integrated.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.230
So we have a couple properties
we can set.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.200
We have reset style inheritance,
and we have apply

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.820
author styles.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.750
Apply author styles is great.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.390
If I turn that on, set that to
true, you can immediately see

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.610
that my Shadow DOM content is
now taking on the look and

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:52.800
feel of this slide deck.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.140
Font faces are the same,
line heights are same.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.040
Reset style inheritance
just says, at

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.510
that Shadow DOM boundary--

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.050
so there's this magical boundary
that when your

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.390
content turns rendering--

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:07.360
at that place, [INAUDIBLE]
define Shadow DOM, any CSS

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.270
properties that are

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.580
inheritable, just resets those.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.130
So that's kind of
a clean slate.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.820
That's how I can define my
own styles, and not have

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.040
inheritable properties bleed
through into my Shadow DOM and

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.290
my custom element.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.680
All right.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.090
Something else you probably want
to do if you're creating

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.210
a custom element is actually
provide some default

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.580
stylings for it.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.870
So say I want my element to be
displayed block by default, or

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.430
have a transition effect when
somebody hovers over it.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.360
This is how I can do that from
internal to my Shadow DOM.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.430
So there's a new @host at-rule
that you can define.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.820
So this style tag would be
inside of my Shadow DOM, and I

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.010
define inside of it.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.730
I don't care what tag it is.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.480
You could be gangnam-style
tag, you could be photo

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.710
[INAUDIBLE] tag, you could
be the x-blink tag.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.770
Whatever you are, set yourself
to be opacity 0.2 and

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.800
transition with an
opacity to 1 when

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.200
somebody hovers over you.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.260
So styling the host element or
the component you're styling--

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.540
this is how you actually
provide some

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.560
default styles for that.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.380
You can set widths, whatever
you want to do, right?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.490
So if you remember in the
previous example, when I

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.580
created that Shadow DOM,
everything inside of that

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.320
thing that I was attaching
myself to completely went

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.110
away, and what was rendered
was the Shadow DOM.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.840
So you're probably saying,
hey, what's up with that?

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.990
And that's where insertion
points come in.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.170
So insertion points are super
powerful, because they allow

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.850
you to sort of define--

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.060
I think of it as a declarative
API, but that's probably not

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.400
the best description for it.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.990
But what I have here is the
same markup on my left.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.590
That's my host.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.940
That's the thing I'm going to
attach the Shadow DOM to.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.390
My Shadow DOM is on the right,
so I'm trying to

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.180
style all H2s red.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.430
And what I have here is a couple
of insertion points.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.410
And so this is a way, internal
to your Shadow DOM, to define

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.750
a structure similar to that
input type date, right?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.960
It has this crazy internal
structure.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.240
I can define placeholders for
content from the left side,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.660
nodes from my host node,
to then be funneled and

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.150
distributed inside of my
insertion points inside of my

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.960
Shadow DOM.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.650
So internal structure in my
Shadow DOM, and then the user

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.240
can sort of put these nodes
where they want, and I'm

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.940
defining that internal
structure.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.550
So content tag is your
insertion point.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.910
And basically you use CSS
selectors to select out nodes

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.390
from the host and be funneled
into the Shadow DOM.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.040
So this first example here is
I'm selecting out all the H2s

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:28.050
in my host node, and so that's
why you see the my subtitle in

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.420
the live demo at bottom.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:32.150
That's why that's rendered
first, rather than this title

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.620
that I've defined in
the original host.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.080
The second one selects out all
elements that have the class

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.610
title, so that's why you're
seeing my title, the H1 follow

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.620
that my subtitle when this
thing's actually rendered in

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.270
the browser.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.010
I have some other markup inside
of my Shadow DOM, and

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.140
the last one, right, just says,
hey, select everything

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.595
else that wasn't selected
out previously

00:15:51.595 --> 00:15:52.760
in insertion points.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.420
And so everything else in here
that I haven't selected out

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.210
previously, which is why an
amazing description comes

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.460
along for the ride
at the end there.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.380
Insertion points are crazy.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.100
It kind of boggled my mind when
I first started learning

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:04.440
about them.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.220
So I actually created a tool
to help myself and to help

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.700
everybody that wants to
learn about this.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.650
This is a pretty cool
visualizer tool.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.710
Everything in blue is
your host node.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.190
These are nodes that are coming
from that host that

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.210
you're attaching
Shadow DOM to.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.060
Yellow is Shadow DOM content,
so these are nodes and

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.473
elements defining Shadow DOM.

00:16:21.473 --> 00:16:24.090
So you can see what I do
is I have this sort

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.870
of visualizer here.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.320
You've got your host node, and
immediately, what the rendered

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.790
compose tree looks like is the
Shadow DOM is winning, right?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.530
So the first thing it's
rendering is the Shadow Dom,

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.850
and as I hover over these, you
can see where they're coming

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.080
from in the different
sections.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.670
In this header, for instance,
I have an insertion point.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.990
It's selecting out those H2s.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.460
One thing nice about
this is that I can

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.320
edit this on the fly.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.270
If I try to change this
insertion point to select out

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.400
H1s, it essentially becomes a
no op in that case, right?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.110
There's nothing that it's
selecting out, because I don't

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.460
have any H1s in my host that
are moving over to

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.860
the Shadow DOM world.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.900
And I can also do the
same thing up here.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.890
So if I add a bunch more H2s,
it doesn't matter where they

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.960
are, right?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.740
That insertion point is
still going to select.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.599
That one that's selecting the
H2s is still going to select

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.900
those out and funnel those
into the correct location

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.089
internal to my widget
Shadow DOM.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:17.560
Very cool.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.060
Very powerful, when you think
about complex widgets, and

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.280
we'll see some examples
later on.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.652
Shadow DOM available in Chrome,
and a couple of the

00:17:24.652 --> 00:17:25.160
mobile browsers.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.329
But I just want to point out
there's a great session later

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.870
on actually right
in this room.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.200
There's polyfills for
all the stuff.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.080
So you can actually play with
this stuff today, which is

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.720
really exciting.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.530
Shadow DOM is super complex, but
having this encapsulated

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.620
world is very, very powerful.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:40.630
Templates.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.040
Shadow DOM.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.550
Let's talk about custom
elements.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.800
Anybody feel like this yet?

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.420
I feel like this every day.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.056
Custom elements.

00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:56.090
Custom elements is sort of where
all this comes together.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.080
It gives you with the element
tag the ability to define new

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.460
HTML elements.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.220
So basically, if I want to
create the x-foo tag, I create

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.610
this element definition with a
name property, and the name is

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.500
the custom element name
that I'm creating.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.840
And so the only caveat here as
you see on the little hover

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.580
here is that the name has
to have a hyphen in it.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.060
So it's got to have
this dash in it.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.150
Similar to regular DOM
elements-- the audio tag is a

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.620
great example.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.680
I can create an audio tag using
the new operator in

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.070
JavaScript.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.380
I can define a constructor on my
element as well, so people

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.670
can then use that constructor
or use the new operator to

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.110
construct my element
using new x-foo.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.730
So that's really cool.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.090
There's nothing different
here.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.030
We're just defining a new
element, and you should be

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.410
able to do all the things that
you can normally do.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.845
So until I actually have this
definition, the browser sees

00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:47.750
this, it registers this element,
it knows about it.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.340
x-foo, if I try to use
that, it's just

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.460
to be the HTML element.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.890
It's not going to be
anything special.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.970
But what you can do--

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.420
there's a new CSS pseudo class,
the unresolved pseudo

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.930
class, that you can use to
prevent things like flash of

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.320
unstyled content.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.870
So if I want to, before the
browser knows about-- so I

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.780
have a bunch x-foos on my page,
and I'm importing those

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.680
later, maybe, I can choose to
style any unresolved element--

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.870
I can set it to opacity
is 0, so it's kind of

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:13.600
hidden from the user.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.320
And then when the browser knows
about it, the x-foo tag

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.940
exists, transition
that opacity in.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.620
So that's kind of a cool pro
tip user experience there.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.310
You get life cycle callbacks
for everything.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.890
So there's a ready callback
that's called.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.570
There's an inserted callback
that's called,

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.030
and a remove callback.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.330
And the use case here is maybe
you have a really complex

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.070
component that uses something
like index DB, right?

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.970
And you have a lot of cleanup
that you need to do before

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.590
somebody rips and removes that
DOM node from their page.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:45.160
And so you want to have
things clean up.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.100
So in your remove callback, you
would make those calls.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.050
And so there's sort of a life
cycle of events and callbacks

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.640
for everything.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.150
You really have insight
into what's going

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.320
on with your element.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.170
Here's an example of creating
a definition.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.480
Just a pretty simple, standard,
cookie cutter

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.650
element definition.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.200
So I can put markup in here,
I can put script, I have a

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.180
section tag here.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.020
In my registration flow, in my
restoration process for this

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.880
element, here is that
ready callback.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.060
So when this element has been
registered in a browser, all

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.690
I'm doing is just setting its
inner text content to this

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.850
section's text content.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.400
So it's pretty silly, but if I
right click on this guy, this

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.340
demo at the bottom here, and you
see this, just to prove to

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:33.380
you, hopefully you see
the x-foo down there.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.720
And all it is, is just set
to that inner text.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.630
It's a pretty silly custom
element, but it's just to show

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.000
you how simple it is.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.300
And similarly to native elements
in the web platform,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.040
you can create a
JavaScript API.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.510
You can create an imperative
API on your element.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.250
So in this case, if somebody
called x-foo--

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.420
the x-foo tag, they had that
element that's created in

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.010
JavaScript and called
dash.foo, they

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.880
would get an alert.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.540
So I can define a declarative
element, but also an

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.660
imperative API for it.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.290
So how do we use this thing once
we define this awesome

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.100
thing that's going to
change the world?

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.610
And the answer is, it's no

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.360
different than normal elements.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.520
So I can declare it.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.390
I can use x-foo once that
element definition is seen by

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.250
the browser.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.580
I can create it in DOM, right?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.110
I can create using

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.570
documentCreateElement with my x-foo.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.210
That's the tag I'm creating.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.530
And this example just shows you,
you can set up a click

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.190
listener, right?

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.430
And then when somebody clicks on
your element, you just call

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.380
that method you've defined
in your definition.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.730
So we'll call that foo method
when the user clicks it.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.760
The last way, if we have that
constructor attribute defined

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.400
on our element definition,
people can use and create our

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.760
elements with the
new operator.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:53.090
So three standard ways you use
an element in HTML-- no

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.090
different than the custom
element world.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.450
If you want, you can go
completely in JavaScript.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.270
If you want to register an
element, create it in

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.850
JavaScript, you can do that
using document.register.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.030
So in this example, same element
as I had before-- so

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.030
just a quick glance, right?

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:14.550
The section tag, the ready
callback, the foo method.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.060
Same thing just in the
JavaScript version.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.490
So I can use object.create, and
I'm saying, OK, create an

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:20.240
element for me.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.000
We're going to be inheriting
from the HTML prototype.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.140
So basically just a
standard element.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.900
I'll set up that ready callback
in JavaScript on the

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.950
prototype chain.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.190
And again, the ready callback,
in this case, all it does is

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:35.540
set the inner text
to I'm an x-foo.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.140
Example of creating the
imperative API.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.370
So I'll add that foo function
to my prototype chain, which

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.780
just alerts itself.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.650
And the last thing here-- to
actually get this thing

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.580
registered in the browser, call
document.register, vendor

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.520
prefixed, with the first
argument is your tag name that

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.980
you want to register, and the
second is an object describing

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.260
that prototype you
just set up.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.820
And so once you do that, this
thing returns a constructor

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:00.850
that you can then use as you
would normally expect.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:05.160
New x-foo, document.create,
x-foo tag.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.410
Totally standard stuff.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.060
How about extending
existing elements?

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:17.170
You saw in the button is
mega-button demo, right, I

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.500
didn't like the way a
button acted, so I

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.040
wanted to extend it.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.930
And so the way you do that in
your element definition is

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.340
with one property here.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.590
Just extends="button".

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.340
So I create a definition for
mega-button, and I say

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.780
extends="button".

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.030
That's all you're doing.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.900
If you want, there's the
JavaScript version.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.070
Same example, but in the
JavaScript world.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:40.450
So this time, I'll use
object.create, and instead of

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:45.260
inheriting from HTML element,
I'm inheriting from a

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.475
specialized version of that.

00:23:46.475 --> 00:23:50.330
So I'm inheriting from HTML
button elements prototype.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.900
And then you register it using
document.register, give it the

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.080
tag name, and that prototype
you've set up.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.090
These are called type extension
custom elements, so

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.520
the button is a syntax.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.030
And there's actually a new
overloaded version of create

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.060
element--
document.createElement--

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.630
and the first argument you give
it is the thing you want

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:07.980
to create, and so the button.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.300
And the second argument is
the is portion of that.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.250
So the button is mega-button,
and what you get back, that

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.040
would be the markup that's
created for that.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.500
So that's a type extension
custom element.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.520
So creating new ones, extending
existing ones.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.390
What about template
and Shadow DOM?

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.540
I talked about that
stuff earlier.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.380
It seems really cool.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.770
It's hard to understand.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.750
Where does all fit into
this picture?

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.460
And that is really that custom
elements and Shadow

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.720
DOM really are BFFs.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.620
And so here's an example of
using that stuff I talked

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.420
about before.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.955
If I want to encapsulate my
markup and hide it in Shadow

00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:44.440
DOM so people can't traverse
into it, I

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.525
basically set up a template.

00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:48.340
So I'm using HTML templates
inside of my custom element

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.700
definition.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:53.280
You can see that I'm using the
@host at-rule to style my

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.550
element in a certain way.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.590
So in this case, I'm saying hey,
please be display block

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.290
at the bottom by default,
and also have

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.270
your background yellow.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.500
So I'm styling my x-foo-shadow
tag to be

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.350
these default styles.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.460
I have some markup in here.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.820
And in this case, since I have
Shadow DOM, in my registration

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.590
process, in my ready callback
when the page has seen this

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.970
element definition, I
create Shadow DOM.

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.150
So I don't just set
inner text.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.840
I have to create this Shadow
DOM from this template.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.920
This refers to the actual
element itself.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.490
So that's my host node.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.840
I'm creating Shadow DOM and
attaching it to my x-foo

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.260
shadow tag.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.480
And I append the template
contents.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.470
So I'll clone the content,
right, just as you saw from

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.620
earlier in the slides.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.310
I'll clone that, and that's
going to be my Shadow DOM is

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:43.380
the clone of this template.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.370
So the live demo at the bottom
here, instead of having

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.790
something that I can view from
the outside world and traverse

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.330
into, it's now encapsulated.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.830
It's not only style
encapsulation, but markup

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.680
encapsulation.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.600
So my x-foo down here, if I try
to traverse into it, you

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.810
see that document fragment
now that's been attached.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:01.550
That's my Shadow DOM.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.490
That's the hidden markup, and
inside of that is the stuff

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.950
that I filled it with.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.380
So again, the only reason I
can do this is because dev

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.100
tools has that show Shadow
DOM flag on.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.660
Normally, a person viewing
source would only see this

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.980
x-foo shadow tag.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.180
So it's really, really
awesome.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.580
That's Shadow DOM, and that's
how you use templates in

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.940
Shadow DOM inside of
a custom element.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.030
But what about insertion
points?

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.000
So I kind of glossed
over that.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.540
I showed you the tool.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.510
This is where things get really,
really powerful.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.800
I can define a my-tabs
element, right?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.880
So this is going to be
like a tabs widget.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.650
Inside of that, I'll
create a template.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.300
Inert markup until I use it.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.840
And I'll create a couple
of insertion points for

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.440
people to adhere to.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.750
So this is my internal
structure.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.425
I'm saying, please, markup, go
here, go here, go here, and

00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:50.250
then I can style this inside
of my custom element

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.480
definition any way I want.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.820
So as a user of this tag, when
somebody uses my-tabs, they

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.510
would use it like this
at the bottom, right?

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.880
They would declare
the my-tabs.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.990
Inside of it, they could put
H2s, they could put section

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:08.640
tags describing the tab, the
title, and the content for it.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.960
And so internal to my custom
element in my Shadow DOM, I

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.900
make it look like this, right?

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.250
With style encapsulation
with my Shadow DOM.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.060
With insertion points, I can
tell the H2s to go into these

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.120
certain areas.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.340
So these become super, super
powerful when you combine it

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.870
with all these extra goodies.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.940
Firefox nightly has
document.register, Chrome has

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.540
document.register, and that's
why these are partially

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.200
highlighted.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.330
The actual definition part is
not in any browser yet, but

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.290
document.register is.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.200
You can play with it today.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.670
So templates, Shadow DOM,
custom elements.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:44.710
The last piece of this equation
is HTML imports.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.150
HTML imports allow us to import
an entire HTML document

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.170
inside of our application.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.140
All we have to do is declare a
link rel-- so there's a new

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.610
rel import type.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.670
So link rel="import", and then
you reference an HTML file

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:59.130
anywhere on the web, right?

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:02.110
It can be on a CDN, it can
be local to your app.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.200
Maybe this HTML file has a bunch
of element definitions

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.120
inside of it.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.780
So once I do that, that's where
I get on my definitions

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.150
from, and x-foo is
defined in it.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.190
Then I can use that
tag on my page.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.230
So this becomes really powerful,
because then you can

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.000
start to reuse other people's
components, or you can reuse

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.310
components you've written
in the past.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.390
So inside of awesome-menu.html,
I can link

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.780
in an x-toolbar tag somebody's
created.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.160
I can link in a menu item
somebody's created.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.345
And when I'm creating this
awesome menu, this new tag

00:28:33.345 --> 00:28:37.040
that I'm defining in HTML,
I can use that work.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.650
So whether it's mine, somebody
else's, totally cool.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.350
And so this is an example of a
custom element using other

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:43.710
custom elements.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.900
Kind of boggles your mind.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.560
But it's super, super handy, and
really, really powerful.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.740
At the bottom, this is what
somebody would use.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.370
My awesome menu.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.380
They would just instantiate the
tag, and they would link

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.570
rel import that.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.820
Very, very cool.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.400
This one is not supported
anywhere yet.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.380
But it's polyfilled, so you
can check out the session

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.950
after this to learn
more about it.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:08.620
So templates, right?

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.040
Inert chunks of markup
to be reused later.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.290
Shadow DOM for encapsulatable
styles in DOM.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:16.720
Custom elements--

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.180
that will give us the actual
definitions of how we create a

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.190
new element in HTML.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.980
And HTML imports allow us to
then import, whether it's a

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.070
document, whether it's element
definitions, any HTML into our

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.470
own document.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.120
So hopefully you guys sort of
see the zen moment here, which

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.660
is pretty cool.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.850
It's very powerful.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.380
It's thinking about building
apps in a declarative HTML

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.550
way, which is different
than we're currently

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.530
thinking about it.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.570
A couple of inspiring demos,
just for kicks.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.670
So we can create a meme gen
tag, which is pretty cool.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.180
So this is a coworker, Seth
Ladd, and he's on

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.340
a beach right now.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.340
And I have content
editable here.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.530
Sup Google IO.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.980
Web rocks!

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.570
And so I've set a click listener
for an on change

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.450
event on this input, so this is
internal to my widget and

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.320
my component.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.990
I can change its background, so
he can be now on the Golden

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.735
Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

00:30:15.735 --> 00:30:18.610
Can throw him over an NYC
if he needs to be.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.770
So again, and it's just
a tag, right?

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.720
So this is what somebody would
declare on their page.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.710
They would give it a source,
I've defined it an attribute

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.360
on my element, just as
with normal HTML.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.700
And then inside of it, they
have H1s and H2s for those

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.790
headers, and so those are
insertion points, then, being

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.470
funneled in to my
custom element.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.850
But it's also about thinking
about apps, right?

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.590
So you can kind of encapsulate
and encompass whole

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.040
functionality into a tag now.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.910
So I can create a photo booth
tag, and its sole purpose is

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:54.450
to basically just wrap the get
user media APIs to do a photo

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:55.960
booth effect in the browser.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:00.440
We're going to get this
to work, you guys.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.180
OK, we're not going
to get it to work.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.670
But you can imagine my face
going through this, and

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:16.700
there's CSS filters and stuff.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.585
But very cool.

00:31:17.585 --> 00:31:19.870
So using other parts of the web
platform, like new parts,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.420
like web RTC, wrap it
in a tag, right?

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.185
So now I have basically an app
within an app, and all

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:29.570
somebody has to do is link,
import this into your app, and

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.980
you've got that functionality
for free.

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.880
So can you try this today?

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.510
The answer is totally you
can try this today.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:38.770
Apart from that last demo,
everything worked as expected.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.370
You can enable a couple feature

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.550
flags in Chrome Canary.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.520
I definitely recommend
Chrome Canary.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.007
It's got the experimental web
features flag that you can

00:31:46.007 --> 00:31:48.430
enable, experimental JavaScript
features flag.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.340
If you're trying Shadow DOM,
trying to understand that

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:54.100
crazy complex, please show
Shadow DOM in the dev tools,

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:54.810
enable that.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.560
Super, super handy.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.620
If you want to follow at least
Chrome and Blink's

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:03.290
implementation of the web
component stuff, there's this

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.140
hot list that you can link to.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:06.880
I'll have a link to the
slides at the end, so

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.170
don't take it down.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.670
But sort of in flight,
low level stuff.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.370
If you want to know about where
this stuff is in flight,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.080
check out the session
right after this.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.730
It's about all these
polyfill libraries

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:17.320
that I've showed you.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.370
All the live demos.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.900
That's what the stuff
is using.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.120
So plug for that.

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.890
You don't even have to
move in this room.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.620
This session's going to be up
at webcomponentsshift.com.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.620
Again, I'm going to put in on
GitHub, so there's my GitHub

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.470
link down there.

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:31.650
I really appreciate
you guys' time.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.820
Thanks for tuning in
on the live stream.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.070
Thank you.
