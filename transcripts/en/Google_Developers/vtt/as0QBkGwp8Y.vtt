JONATHAN BERI: So this session,
we're going to

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.780
introduce you all to the
Google+ Sign-In and the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.580
Google+ platform.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.700
You may have seen the Google+
Sign-In for the very first

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.710
time this morning, during
the keynote.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.230
Or you browsed the Docs and
want to get started.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.740
So this session is for you.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.860
We're going to go over the core
features of the Google+

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.670
platform and the Google+ Sign-In
button and show you

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.250
just enough code to give you
the right set of context.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.830
Before we get too far into it,
allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.240
My name is Jonathan Beri.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm a developer advocate on
the Google+ platform.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.770
If you have questions about
this session afterwards or

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.510
want to learn more about the
Google+ platform and just

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.105
generally talk to somebody on
the Google+ team, add me to

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:41.550
your Circles.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.900
That's a link to my profile.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.650
That's the best way to
get a hold of me.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.560
And yeah, I'm responsive.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.440
And you can ask me technical
questions or anything else.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.512
I'm also joined by my colleague
from Google+.

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:53.730
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Hi, I'm Ridhima
Kedia, a technical leader in

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.950
Google+ platform.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.440
JONATHAN BERI: Awesome,
thank you, Ridhima.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.430
So today's agenda--

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.790
we're going to cover four main
areas of the Google+ platform.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.870
The first and most important is
the Google+ Sign-In button.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.250
This is a widget, a plug-in, a
snippet of code that you can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.830
add to your applications to
enable users to connect their

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.330
Google accounts to
your services.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.980
And with it, we add a little bit
of Google magic that we're

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.400
going to show you a
little bit later.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.090
Once the user is signed in,
they've granted access to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.140
their Google profile.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.540
So you can start integrating
that profile, making a

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.720
personalized and engaging
experience

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.240
and a returning user.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.980
With Google+ Sign-In, we also
introduced a new form of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.840
sharing, a type of targeted
sharing that enables users to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.240
reach out to their friends on
Google and then bring them

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.590
back to your app in
an engaged way.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.810
So they can start using your
application in a social way,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.660
instantaneously.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.120
And the last piece we're going
to cover is what we call App

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.720
Activities.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.930
This is a way to enable you to
write activities to Google

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.950
that users are doing
within your app.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.210
And then Google will surface
those activities in meaningful

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.280
times across Google, at
the right moment,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.110
for the right user.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.060
Great.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.530
So let's start thinking
social.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.639
I work with a lot of developers,
and they tell me

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.180
the same thing.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.140
I want to use social
platforms.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.320
I want to integrate social into
my applications, but I

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.330
don't know where to begin.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.620
Let's pause for a minute and
think about what does it mean

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.140
to be social in our
daily lives?

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.620
It's really about two things--

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.920
people and connections.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.890
So similarly, to enable social
within your applications, it's

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.010
about bringing people and
connections into your apps.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.800
And the reason why you want to
do that as a developer is to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.760
acquire new users and
increase engagement.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.230
And in fact, with the Google+
platform and Google+ Sign-In,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.120
the features we built were
targeted to make sure that we

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.280
can help you get new users
and increase engagement.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.260
And throughout this talk, we'll
mention those features,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.170
where they help you get users
and increase engagement.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.380
And a bit of a spoiler--

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.190
it's all the features.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.110
All right?

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.040
Great.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.450
So let's talk about the
Google+ Sign-In.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.310
And where it starts, it
starts with a button.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.530
The Google+ Sign-In is a button
you can add to your web

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.570
apps, to your mobile
apps, and your iOS.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.160
It's a plug-in, it's a widget,
it's a piece of HTML that

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160
enables users to connect
their Google

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.580
account with your service.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.350
It's a seamless experience to
allow them to authorize you to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.820
start accessing their
profile information.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.930
And when you add the Google+
Sign-In button to your apps,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.790
you can be confident that users
are going to start to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.030
use it as a way to log in.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.320
That's because Google
is a trusted brand--

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.320
a brand built on privacy
and security.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.840
We have things like two-factor
authentication, multi-login,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.510
and the controlled sharing of
Circles that gets carried over

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.010
with the Google+ Sign-In
product.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.610
And as developer, Google handles
the authorization for

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.990
you, which is a very complicated
problem that we

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.030
help you solve.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.830
So a user clicks that button,
and we take them through the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.980
authorization flow.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.210
Here's the authorization screen
that a user might see

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.430
if they're using Jolicloud.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.400
And there's three
major sections.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.120
There's the branding at the top,
the set of permissions

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.839
you're asking the users to
confirm, and the ability for

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.860
them to accept or deny
your request.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.959
Let's walk through each part.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.490
So the top is the branding.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.870
This is controlled by you, as
a developer, to let the user

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.880
know who they are about
to sign into.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.690
Now let's walk through
those permissions.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.990
The very first line is the basic
Google+ API permissions.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.210
This enables you, as a
developer, to access the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.530
user's public profile
information--

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.820
things like their first and
last name, their profile

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.210
picture, their Google ID, and
anything else they might have

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.460
enabled on their profile
to be public.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.430
But it also includes the people
that they follow in

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.130
their Circles.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.040
This is a flat list of the
people and the pages that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.740
they've added on Google+.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.800
And you'll notice there is
an Edit List option.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.170
This is the very first place
that we provide control and

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.450
trust to the user, so they can
say who you, as a developer,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.310
know about in their Circles.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.580
This creates confidence
for the Google+

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.600
Sign-In as a login solution.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.190
The next line is another
permission.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.880
This is actually the Google
Drive permission.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.940
So with Google+ Sign-In, we
enable you to use multiple

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.980
Google APIs in a single
authorization flow.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.400
This is very powerful, because
Google provides a lot of great

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.700
services that could benefit
you as a developer.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.600
And the user only has to
authorize those services in a

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.690
single dialogue.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.460
The next line is their
Google email.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.980
This is their official email
they use to log in every

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.000
single day.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.040
There's not a form field they
might mistype that email or a

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.870
spam account they might want
to not deal with, if they

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.920
register for your service.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.520
So you can trust that this is
their real Google email.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.930
So if you have existing user
accounts, and you see this

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.400
email, this is most
likely that user.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.130
And if you get emails from other
networks, you can use

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.510
that as a join to combine
user accounts.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.547
And the last bit is the
permission to write App

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.430
Activities on behalf
of that user.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.780
And like the List field, the
user can control just exactly

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.450
who can see their activities and
which activities are being

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:20.700
written on their behalf.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.890
So now for that magic--

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.390
a little bit of the
Google magic.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.040
When a user signs in the Google+
Sign-In button, and

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.730
you have an App in the Google
Play Store, if that user has

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.376
an Android device, when they
click that button, in that

00:06:37.376 --> 00:06:40.980
flow, we will ask them, would
you like to install this

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.090
Android app, as well?

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.330
And Google handles
that for you.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.470
So we're pushing your Android
app directly to engaged users,

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.890
who already have connected with
your service, directly to

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.990
the phone in their pocket.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.090
They don't even have
to take it out.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.420
This is the number one easiest
way for Android developers to

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.890
acquire Android users.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.250
And this is one of
those features

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.620
that seeing is believing.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.070
So let's watch a short
clip from one of

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.240
our integration partners.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.520
PETE MOLETIERRE: The main driver
behind our success is

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.030
having a product that's
easy to use and

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.420
delights our customers.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.120
Over-the-air install provides
users with a seamless

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.150
experience.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.640
They create their account or
log into it for the first

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.690
time, and our Android
application is automatically

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.270
installed on the user's
smartphone, so that they can

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.270
have a delightful first
time experience.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:37.020
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.870
JONATHAN BERI: Awesome, huh?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.340
And as we saw in the keynote
today, if they've logged in

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.740
already on the web, they have
that Android app on their

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.690
phone, they're seamlessly signed
in with seamless sign

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.950
on across platforms.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.650
Now we've been out for about
two months now, and we're

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.440
seeing fantastic conversion
rates for users.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.210
So we announced just yesterday
that 40% of users who see this

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.290
dialogue say yes.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.560
And that doesn't include the
users who already have your

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.390
Android app installed.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.390
So this is a number one way
to get new Android users.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.260
So now, I'm going to turn it
over to Ridhima to show us

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.600
some that code to add the
Google+ Sign-In button to your

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.850
applications.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.880
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.130
When we designed Google+
Sign-In, one of our key goals

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.800
was to reduce integration
complexity for developers.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.730
It really is amazingly simple
to integrate this into your

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.930
application.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.950
For example, we use OAuth
2.0 to allow the user to

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.200
authorize your app.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.530
But all the implementation
details are completely hidden

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.240
away from you.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.820
You don't have to worry about
any implementation details

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.539
regarding OAuth 2.0.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.520
This integration simplicity has
been extended across all

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.050
the different platforms that
we support, be it web,

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.300
Android, or iOS.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.370
If you remember nothing else
from this talk, please

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.830
remember our developer site,
developers.google.com/+.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.670
We have quick start, sample
code, reference material to

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.000
guide you through your
development.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.860
Let's quickly talk through all
the integration steps.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.010
The very first step is to go
to the API console and

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.790
register your application.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.990
On doing that, you will
receive a client ID.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:15.640
Please make note of
this client ID.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.090
We will use it in the sign up
process to identify your

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.340
application.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.130
Now let's take the
web JavaScript

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.770
library for an example.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.820
What does it take to put that
button on your web page?

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.270
You need to load a single
JavaScript library from

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.326
Google, and you need to add
markup on your page where you

00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:34.900
want us to render the button--

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.780
that's it.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:36.390
We take it from there.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.170
We will parse your page and
render the button, based on

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.730
the configuration options
that you specify.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.210
The button will be rendered,
localized in the language of

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.230
the currently logged
in Google user.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.050
And we also allow you to use
custom styling to tweak the

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.070
look of the button.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.790
All we ask is that you respect
our branding guidelines.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.430
These are posted on the
developer site that I

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:57.680
mentioned earlier.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.550
Let's talk through
the different

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.620
options that are available.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.520
By specifying the g-signin
class, you tell us where in

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.320
your DOM you want us to
render the button.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.700
Remember the client ID we just
fetched from the API console.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.080
You need to specify that here,
so that we can identify your

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.330
application.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.160
So when you walk through the
content dialogue, we saw that

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.830
your app can ask the user
for certain permissions.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.680
Plus.login is the very basic
scope for Google+ platform

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.460
integration, which allows you
to fetch the user's profile

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.450
data, meaning their
name, profile

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.030
URL, age range, gender.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.840
It also allows you to
fetch the people

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.250
in the user's Circles.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.820
In addition, it allows you
to write back different

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.970
activities that the user is
taking within your app back to

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.650
Google, so that we can surface
it in interesting

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.030
and relevant contexts.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.840
Your app may require additional
permissions.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.060
So for example, if you need to
access the user's files, you

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.790
would ask for the Drive
scope here.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.610
Suppose you use Wallet as part
of your payment solution.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.640
You would also ask for the

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.410
payments.makepayment scope here.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.690
By specifying a cookie policy,
you allow us to optimize

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.230
performance by caching OAuth 2.0
tokens by storing cookies

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.360
on your site.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.670
The complete documentation for
this is available on our

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.920
developer site.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.475
Remember these App Activities we
keep talking about that you

00:11:17.475 --> 00:11:19.060
can write back to Google?

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.930
Using request visible actions,
you specify what are the

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.110
different activity types that
you would like to write back.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.300
There are over 10 different
activity types to choose from,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.240
and you can specify more than
one activity type here.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.890
For example, if you wanted to
write back user purchase

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.430
events, you would specify
the buy activity here.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.580
You can specify a JavaScript
callback that will be called

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.350
on a successful auth result.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.085
This could be as a result of
the user clicking Accept on

00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:48.930
the consent dialogue or as the
result of auto-approval, in

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.760
case the user has ever
authorized your app before on

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.280
Android or web.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.120
In any case, in this callback,
we recommend that you hide the

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.220
Sign-In button, and you can go
ahead and personalize your app

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.590
to give the user a better
experience.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.360
So here is the code snippet that
you would need to add to

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.010
your page to load the JavaScript
library we talked

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.440
about earlier.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.660
This is the same plusone.js that
we use for all Google+

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.440
plug-ins, including
the +1 button.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.330
So if you have integrated +1
already on your site, you

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.280
would already have this code
snippet, and you don't need to

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.440
add it again.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.710
plusone.js parses the page and
renders the button, based on

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:27.960
your configuration options.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.840
As Jonathan just showed you,
one of the most amazing

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.050
features of Google+ Sign-In is
driving over-the-air installs

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.980
of your Android app right
from the Sign-In flow.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.190
It's completely trivial
for you to set up.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.170
All you do is specify the app
package name, and we will take

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.060
it from there.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.470
We will decide how and when to
show the dialogue and all the

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.500
different error conditions.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.650
As I mentioned earlier, this
integration simplicity extends

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.730
across mobile platforms,
as well.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.580
On Android, we provide
Google Play services.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.260
This is a background service
already running on most

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.920
Android devices that lets you
easily make Google API calls.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.150
This means that to invoke the
Sign-In flow, you call connect

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.590
on the PlusClient library, and
the Sign-In flow initiates.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.390
Similarly, we have a
native SDK for iOS.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.760
To start the Sign-In flow, you
would need to configure the

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.080
GPPSignIn shared singleton
instance.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.950
Then you can go ahead and make
authenticated calls, once the

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.070
user authorizes your app.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.880
So now that we have an
authenticated user, Jonathan

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.300
will tell you more about how you
can personalize your site

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.440
to give the user a
good experience.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.690
JONATHAN BERI: Thank
you, Ridhima.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.370
So the user's connected with
your service and has allowed

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.610
to access their Google
account.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.290
So at this point, you want to
start personalizing that

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.150
experience, integrating their
Google information to make

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.450
their login view personal
to them.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.180
You can start integrating their
profile to make it an

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.110
engaging new user experience.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.505
You can streamline registration,
or you can even

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.660
forego registration all together
and start pulling

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.790
their profile and making
them that new user.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.800
You can also start using their
Circles, the people in their

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.360
Circles, and suggest content
and connections,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.990
based on that data.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.760
So let's take a look
at two examples.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.720
So this is Flixster.com,
who has already

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.590
integrated Google+ Sign-In.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.780
And this is one of
my real accounts.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.410
You can see they've pulled in
my profile information, so I

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.440
know which account
I'm logged into.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.930
They have my first and
last name that

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:28.800
they've pulled in directly--

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.420
I've never typed that in.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.450
And behind the scenes, they are
doing a few other things

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.800
which are not clear here.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.600
But they have my Google email.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.930
So they're actually sending me
email notifications when

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.200
videos and films that I'm
tracking are now in theaters

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.840
or available to purchase.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.500
On the side, they actually pull
in my Google Circles.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.000
These are friends of mine who
are using Google+ Sign-In and

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.320
are using Flixster.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.560
So this way, I can start
tracking their activity and

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.430
see what they're doing
right on Flixster.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.050
And this is a pretty powerful
integration, integrating

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:03.900
Circles to help me discover
my friends.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.750
But using that same data, you
could have a more meaningful

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.860
experience.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.160
Let's take a look at Banjo.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.490
Banjo is another integration
partner of Google+ Sign-In.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.480
And they do something
very powerful here.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.830
What they do is they take a
bunch of different social

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.860
networks, and they do joins
across those networks.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.412
And they help me discover people
I might be interested

00:15:23.412 --> 00:15:27.030
in, based off of my social
connections.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.025
So by taking the people in my
circle, these connections that

00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:33.340
I talked about earlier, you can
make for a more meaningful

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.320
experience.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.840
This is an engagement tool.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.950
You can use social connections
to help users discover new

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.120
content, whether that be new
people to follow or maybe a

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.820
new interesting video that
their friends are

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.790
watching right now.

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:52.350
Again, this is helping those
users stay longer and interact

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.070
more deeply.

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.470
Now Ridhima, to see some code.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.830
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.440
So now that we have an
authenticated user, we can

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.590
start making authenticated API
requests to fetch their social

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:08.050
data, like their profile
data or their friends.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.890
We have client libraries in all
major languages and native

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.430
SDKs for mobile.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.530
Once again, let's look at
web for an example.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.810
So for our client libraries,
we have built a common

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.710
infrastructure that we call
the Discovery Service.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.500
Using metadata, we dynamically
build native

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.050
methods for an API.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.520
This means that you only have to
use a single client library

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.380
for any Google API call.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.330
So if you're making any Google
API calls in your application,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:40.200
you would already be familiar
with these client libraries.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.460
Loading the plusone.js
code snippet defines

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.510
the gapi local object.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:48.680
We can use this now to load
different client modules.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.712
In order to make social API
calls, we would load the plus

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:52.980
v1 module here.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.780
If we had wanted to make
calender API calls, we would

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.470
have loaded the calendar
v3 module here.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.840
Loading the plus v1
module defines the

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.740
gapi client plus object.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.579
Now if you want to fetch the
user's profile data, you would

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.859
call people.get on
this object.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.150
You would need to specify the
user ID which you want to

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.510
fetch data for.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.970
If you want to fetch data for
the currently logged in Google

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.829
user, we provide you
a shortcut-- me.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.730
Similarly, if you had wanted to
fetch the user's friends,

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.930
we would call people.list on
the same object, again

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:29.700
specifying the same user ID
parameter for which you again

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.090
have the shortcut, me.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:33.990
In addition, you would need to
specify the collection visible

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:36.580
parameter to fetch those friends
that are visible to

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.830
your app, as selected
by the user.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.970
Now that we have defined the
function, we can execute it,

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.480
providing a JavaScript function
that will receive

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.780
this profile data and actually
personalize your app.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.160
Now that we understand how
personalization works,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.470
Jonathan will tell you how
Google+ platform provides

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.400
interactive sharing.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.830
JONATHAN BERI: Thank
you, Ridhima.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.670
So if your application
has content, users

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.890
want to share that.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.430
And as a developer or content
creator, you want them to be

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.220
sharing that content, so
you get more users.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:12.730
But we've noticed a problem
with social sharing today.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.830
Let's say you convince somebody
that this is worth

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.070
sharing, and they'll share
it out to their networks.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.840
Their friends may see that on
their already busy stream.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.300
If something really catches
their eye, they may click on

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.690
that link and go to your site.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.200
If it's a video, they might
watch it, they might drop out,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.690
and you'll have a
balanced rate.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.920
But you really are not getting
the kind of engagement that

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.270
you're really looking for.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.880
So we set out to do a new
type of sharing--

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.470
a form of targeted sharing that
enables users to reach

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.710
out to their friends on Google
and then bring them to your

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.190
app with the mindset to already
start engaging.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.240
And we call this interactive
posts.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.420
Let's walk through an
interactive post.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.500
So the first thing you'll
notice, this looks like a

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.610
social share.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.880
It has a Share button.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.820
There's a link associated with
it, and it's very similar to

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.260
the other types of shares
we do on Google today.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.500
But the most obvious difference
is a big button--

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.580
a call to action button.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.650
This is a button that when
it shows up in the

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:10.630
stream will stand out.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.190
And it's clickable.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.090
So if a user sees that and is
interested in the description

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.260
and the copy, they will click
on that button, and it will

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.790
take them somewhere.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.130
Where you take them is a deep
link that you provide.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.600
Whether they're on mobile or
web, we will route them to the

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.460
context that you specify.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.510
And that should be the context
that I originally shared out

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.320
the interactive post.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.910
That deep link will also take
them directly to your app.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.630
And if you don't have the
app, we'll help that

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.200
user get your app.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.760
So interactive post is not only
a great way to increase

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.750
engagement to a targeted sharer,
but it's also a way to

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.290
capture new users.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.950
So a few more things about
the interactive post.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.800
As a developer, you can
pre-fill the text.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.950
So you can set up the context
over the share.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.740
And if a user likes what
they see, they can go

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.610
ahead and share it.

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.080
Or they can edit it.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.490
What's really important about
interactive post, besides

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.310
being targeted and interactive,
is that it is

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.700
user-generated.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.500
So when one of your friends
receives an interactive post

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.490
notification, they know it
actually came from you.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.230
So that helps with conversion
and making this share a more

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.160
meaningful share for both the
sender and the recipient.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.780
The last thing I want
to highlight is the

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.930
names at the top.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.560
So when you share, you have
a target, you set the

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.440
recipients.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.580
But as a developer,
you can pre-fill

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.200
the recipient targets.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.850
And this includes email.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.070
So if you already have users in
your system with email from

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:39.820
a username password or through
another social network, you

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.630
can target and pre-fill across
networks via email.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.500
Extremely powerful, especially
for marketing, especially for

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.530
growing your cross-network
user base.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.740
So let's walk through
a scenario of

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.640
an interactive post.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.740
And we're going to use OpenTable
as an example.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.330
And OpenTable has integrated
Google+ Sign-In.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.550
And we'll do just a little
bit of role play here.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.880
So fast forward three days,
we're all done with I/O, and

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.220
the team wants to go out for a
delicious dinner to celebrate

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.760
a successful event.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.150
There's a fantastic ceviche
place just down on the

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.650
Embarcadero.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.330
But I want to make sure
that the restaurant

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.870
has options for everybody.

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.140
So I start reviewing the menu.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:19.420
It looks good.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.290
There's vegetarian options, of
course, ceviche, and a little

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.110
Pisco Sour for those of us
who need to relax a bit.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.260
And I want to share this out
with the rest of the team, so

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.600
they can decide if they
want to join.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.990
So OpenTable has integrated an
interactive post button.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.940
This is a customizable button
that looks right in their UI.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.260
When I click that button, I get
that familiar dialogue we

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.030
just saw a moment ago.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.880
They have that view menu that
when my friends see it and my

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.800
colleagues see it, they'll know
that there's a menu on

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.490
the other side.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.960
So I go ahead and share
it with Ridhima.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.810
Ridhima has her Android phone in
her pocket, and she gets a

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.410
little buzz.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:58.660
That buzz has a notification
that somebody has directly

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.420
shared something with her, which
is an interactive post.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.950
It's a notification that
actually stands out above

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.635
others, so that she knows that
there's something waiting for

00:22:07.635 --> 00:22:09.990
her, like a direct message.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.050
She clicks on that notification,
and she's taken

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:16.280
to the stream where she can
see that full share with

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.570
pre-filled text that OpenTable
provided, the image, and that

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.810
call to action button.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.080
When she clicks on that call
to action button, there's a

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.510
deep link behind it.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.820
And we take her directly to
the context that OpenTable

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.350
wanted her to, which
is the menu that I

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.700
was originally sharing.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.300
So now she's in OpenTable,
engaging directly, reviewing

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.066
the menu, and can confirm
that reservation at a

00:22:38.066 --> 00:22:40.280
later point in time.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.300
We have over 100 different
labels

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.320
for our call to actions.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.720
These are configurable labels.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.180
And we're seeing developers
adding multiple types.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.440
Because this goes beyond a
standard social share.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.310
There's an action associated
with it.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.940
So let's say you're a publisher
site, and you have

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.010
video content.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.670
You might want to have a Watch
button, where users click that

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.840
button, and they're taken
to a video that starts

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.090
automatically.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:05.030
Sorry, that was a Podcast one.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.820
We also have Listen and Watch.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:09.990
Let's say you're an educational
site, and you want

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.380
to take users straight to the
content to avoid registration.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.540
You might have a Learn button.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:20.070
And if you have your own
commenting system, you would

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.350
have a Comment and Reply.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.330
Of course, there's e-commerce
solutions, where you want to

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.480
have a user, see that
Buy button, see

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.080
something they like.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.150
And when they click it, they're
taken directly to the

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.050
checkout page with that
item pre-filled.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.830
We're also seeing partners
combining it in multiple

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.810
different ways and intelligent
ways to make it

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.100
part of your app--

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.260
not just a little share
icon off the center.

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.980
Because they want to drive
users to share more

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.450
targetedly.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.240
And just like the rest
of the platform, it's

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.250
very easy to integrate.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.020
So back to Ridhima to
show us that code.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.330
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.260
For interactive posts, we've
built on existing Google

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.250
sharing plug-ins and APIs.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.230
And all of our client libraries
and mobile SDKs

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.550
package it up for easy
integration.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.170
We have built in deep links.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.680
This means that no matter which
device a user views an

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.220
interactive post in, on clicking
it, they will be

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.415
taken to the right context
within your application.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.480
Once again, let's take the
web as an example.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.680
Just like the Sign-In flow,
the interactive post flow

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.200
starts with a rendered
button that you can

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.820
configure through markup.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.420
Now we've omitted some of the
fields here, but if you look

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.360
at the important bits, the call
to action label can be

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.040
specified by an enum, and the
compete list is documented in

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.060
a developer site.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:39.280
We just saw a preview off all
the different actions

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.990
that you can take.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.450
It could be Buy, Comment,
View, Watch,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.750
Listen, you name it.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.180
The call to action URL is the
URL which the users will be

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.980
taken to if they click on
the interactive post on

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.450
plus.gooogle.com.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.280
The deep link ID takes the user
directly to the right

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.790
context within your application,
if they click on

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.630
the post in one of the mobile
versions of Google+.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.930
You can pre-define a pre-filled
text that will be

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.160
populated in the share, which
of course, can be

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.640
edited by the user.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.810
You can pre-define a list of
recipients, up to 10 users.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.030
It can be specified in the form
of Google user IDs or any

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.210
email addresses.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.130
Do you notice some familiar
fields here like client ID,

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.660
scope, request visible
actions?

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.620
These are all similar
to the Sign-In flow.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.440
That is because the interactive
post also takes

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.650
the user through the Sign-In
flow if they have not

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:34.030
already signed in.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.700
This is especially useful for
the use case in which you want

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.590
the user to sign in only when
they want to share.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.420
So this is yet another
way we help you get

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.360
more signed in users.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.510
For comparison, here is a
snippet of the interactive

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:50.050
post integration on iOS.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.740
As you can see, the syntax may
be different, but the code

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:54.580
pieces are exactly the same.

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.690
So this is amazing
for developers.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.480
Since if you understand how
interactive posts work on one

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.410
platform, you can easily
integrate it

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.180
into any other platform.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.440
Now that we've talked about
sharing, Jonathan will tell

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.040
you how you can write back
different App Activities that

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.360
the user takes within your
site, back to Google.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.150
JONATHAN BERI: Thank you.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.700
So you have a logged in
user, and they're

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.830
taking all these actions.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.750
They might be uploading
content, they might be

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:22.220
reading, they might be
creating new things.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.100
And all these actions are
happening within your

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.820
application, but other users
don't know about this.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.590
They're not discoverable.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.400
So with Google+ Sign-In, we
enabled something we call App

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.050
Activities.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.310
It's a way for you, as a
developer, to write to Google,

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.430
so that we can surface those
activities to other users,

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.620
across Google, at
the right time.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.100
We actually demoed this
integration just the other

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.220
week at TechCrunch Disrupt.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.330
So here's how one such
integration would look like.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.840
So let's say a user's searching
for Fandango--

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.890
Fandango has integrated
Google+ Sign-In.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.340
All those activities that users
are taking with their

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.330
app, they're sending
to Google.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:01.860
And Google is aggregating those
activities, anonymizing

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.020
them, to show other users what
is trending on Fandango.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.750
This way, other Fandango users
might discover new and

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:12.980
interesting content based off
of Google users, as a whole,

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.260
or even help Fandango
get new users by

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.700
discovering their brand.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.160
These are clickable links in the
knowledge cart that, like

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.760
we saw before, are a deep link,
which would take the

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.320
user directly to Fandango, to
the right context, to the

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.920
video, where they can start
seeing the trailer or even

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.920
purchasing tickets.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.800
This is the direction we want
to go with this product.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.230
We want to help you to surface
your apps in more meaningful

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.340
ways across Google by making
those activities users are

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.900
taking in a social context
useful for others.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.565
And this is the very first place
that we're integrating

00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:48.340
App Activities.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.850
And just like the rest
of the APIs, it's

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.260
very easy to integrate.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.330
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.110
So now that you have a signed
in user, you can write back

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.480
different App Activities that
the user takes within your

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.010
site back to Google.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.460
And as Jonathan just showed,
we can surface them in

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.590
interesting and relevant
contexts.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.860
We have already seen that we
have client libraries in most

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.410
popular languages and native
SDKs for mobile.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.810
All we do now is use one of
those client libraries and

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.010
call an API to write these
moments back to Google.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.730
So here's a sample of our
Python client library.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:25.650
To write an activity back, you
would need to specify the

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:26.880
activity type.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.210
Again, for example, if you
wanted to write back user

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.370
purchase events, you would
specify the Buy

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:32.920
activity type here.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.010
This should be an activity type
that you have already

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.020
configured in your
Sign-In markup.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.450
And the user would have
explicitly granted access to

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.130
this type when they see
the consent dialogue.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.250
In addition, you would specify
a target URL, which should

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.000
contain the schema dot markup
for the activity type you have

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.850
just specified.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.620
Now that we understand how the
different pieces of the

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.140
Sign-In flow come together,
Jonathan will summarize all

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.390
that we have learned today.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:28:59.760
JONATHAN BERI: Great.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.880
So let's do a little
bit of review.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.770
We saw the Google+
Sign-In button--

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.310
the easiest way for you to
acquire new users by enabling

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.020
them to connect their Google
account with your app.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.610
We saw how you can take that
user and create a personalized

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.110
experience with their Google
profile and their

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.030
connections on Google.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.300
We talked about how you can
increase engagement by using

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.510
interactive posts to get users
to bring their friends back

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.660
into your app and interacting
immediately.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.665
And the last bit we just
talked about, our App

00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:32.010
Activities that we can use to
surface relevant information

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.400
across Google.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.770
Now today, I went through
everything very quickly and

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.240
very briefly.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.030
There's a ton of detail to
make this an awesome

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.950
integration, depending on your
platform and your type of

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.080
integration.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.330
Throughout the rest of Google
I/O, we have sessions on every

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.460
feature, in great detail, from
beginning with Android to best

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.070
practices across the web
and boot camps--

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.180
sorry--

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.190
code labs that get you started
and get you finished.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.700
So I suggest if you're
interested in any of these

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.580
topics that you attend
one of these.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.490
And if you're in the live
stream, a lot of them will be

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.340
available to watch, as well.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.640
A quick credit to the images I
used earlier, and I want to

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.730
thank you for getting interested
in Google+ Sign-In.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.160
Three important links before
we take questions--

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.043
one is our developer site, which
you've seen already.

00:30:21.043 --> 00:30:24.470
It's developers.google.com/+.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.550
That's the overall
developer site.

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.240
We use our Google+ page and
our Google+ community to

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.720
engage with conversation and
answer questions about

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:37.090
different topics, so I suggest
you add the Google+ Developers

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.730
page to your Circles.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.400
And the last is our Stack
Overflow page.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.520
This is where we do a
lot of our support.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.070
So if you have technical
questions that you can't

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.040
figure out through the
documentation, this is a great

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040
place to go.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.320
Again, my name is Jonathan Beri,
joined by Ridhima Kedia.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.286
And we thank you.

00:30:53.286 --> 00:30:58.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:58.650
JONATHAN BERI: Awesome.

00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.890
So we have plenty of
time for questions.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.810
So for those who are here,
come up to the mic.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.335
And we're going to try to figure
out how I can do the

00:31:04.335 --> 00:31:06.280
online thing in a second.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.190
And let's start, left first.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:11.040
AUDIENCE: One puzzlement that
I've had is the sign

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.810
out from the app.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.190
I don't know whether it's
best practice--

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.870
because you can have them sign
out completely out of Google

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:20.290
or just sign out of your app.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.670
And how do you serve that
to the customer, so they

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.150
understand if they're going to
sign out of their Google

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.270
account or just out
of the account?

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.360
And what's your recommended
best practice for that?

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.870
JONATHAN BERI: So that's
a great question.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.620
It's about sign out.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.910
We've seen a few different
implementations of sign out.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.500
A lot of you developers just
want to keep it logged in.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.070
As long as they're logged into
Google, they want to keep them

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.190
logged into your service.

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.640
But some users expect
sign out.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.160
We made it really easy
to disconnect.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.900
So when they want to
disassociate their Google

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.110
account with your service,
we have an API

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.320
that makes that easy.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.290
And we've seen already
developers implement their own

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.300
form of sign out.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.150
It really depends
on their logic--

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.470
how they treat a user, what the
need is to be signed in.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.590
Is it in the browser?

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.880
Is it in the server?

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.950
And we actually have a session
on best practices where we

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.490
talk about it, as well as
authorization, where we talk a

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.180
little bit more about
sign out.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.570
But it entirely depends
on your integration.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.615
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess, let's
say a person's traveling--

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:15.920
they're at a hotel.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.980
Maybe they just signed out of
your app, but they're still

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.990
logged into their Gmail.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.290
Someone could go access
their mail.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.960
Or they're at home, and they're
doing their daily

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.390
activities, and they sign out.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.870
You just signed them out of
their Google account, so how

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.620
do you deal with that?

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.760
It seems like it's confusing
to the customer.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.050
JONATHAN BERI: Typically,
especially the services that

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.850
do really care about sign out,
is they track it themselves.

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:41.025
So they'll use their own cache,
whether that be a

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:43.820
cookie or local storage, to
say this user signed out.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.550
Or if that user is in the
server, then they're going to

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.630
basically disassociate that
server with that currently

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.250
logged in session.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.770
So we can talk about that more
after, depending on how your

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:53.420
app is built.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.195
AUDIENCE: All right,
thank you.

00:32:54.195 --> 00:32:55.504
JONATHAN BERI: Sure thing.

00:32:55.504 --> 00:32:55.886
Let's go--

00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:56.670
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.230
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about Android, but I guess it

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.580
applies to any application.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.040
Let's say I want to use other
Google APIs like Tasks or

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.790
Google URL Shortening
and stuff like that.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.770
Can I use this, and then add
another scope, and then ask

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.590
only one set of permissions
to the user?

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.480
Or it's something different and
then I need to ask user

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.920
multiple things, like give you
access to your Google+

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.090
profile, let me put Tasks
or stuff like that?

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.020
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah,
great question.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.780
The question is, can I use
multiple scopes at one time?

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.530
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.140
JONATHAN BERI: And the answer
is absolutely, yes.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.740
We showed some snippet
of code.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.570
Basically, when you set up the
Sign-In button, if it's

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.370
Android, if it's iOS, web, you
pass in multiple scopes.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.730
So we show the user an
expandable dialogue with each

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.610
line representing a scope.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:45.712
And also for the mobile
context, especially on

00:33:45.712 --> 00:33:48.540
Android, they also approve the
hardware permissions as well,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.260
in that same single dialogue.

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.710
AUDIENCE: So is there any reason
to use the other Google

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:59.330
account authentication process
from the services?

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.970
It seems like it's better
to use Google+, right?

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.250
JONATHAN BERI: So you mean the
local account manager?

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.250
JONATHAN BERI: That's the
current way, right?

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:08.400
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.550
JONATHAN BERI: And now the
Google+ way gets you a lot

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.880
more user information--

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.190
so more about their profile,
more about their connections.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.830
So you can make a lot more
meaningful social app, versus

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.550
just knowing their email.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:19.380
So with Google+ Sign-In, we
provide you access to all

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.499
those additional pieces of
information about the user.

00:34:22.499 --> 00:34:22.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.650
JONATHAN BERI: So we would
recommend you use Google+

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:25.636
Sign-In for that.

00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:27.115
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:34:27.115 --> 00:34:27.610
JONATHAN BERI: This one.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:28.980
AUDIENCE: Great presentation,
really

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:29.699
exciting what you're doing.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:30.020
JONATHAN BERI: Thank you.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:31.659
AUDIENCE: My question is
basically the same as what he

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.030
had, just want to make sure
to clarify though.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:37.510
So my question is, if I start
with a certain set of scopes,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.030
and then I want to escalate the
user later, like I want to

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:42.340
start with a certain set of
scopes that are very limited,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.860
and I escalate, do I
have then two OAuth

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.870
tokens that I'm managing?

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.110
Or is it a single OAuth token?

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.750
Because I could see that if I'm
having to manage multiple

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:52.420
tokens on my app side--

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.340
so is it a single OAuth
token that will be

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.239
resolved at the end?

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.730
Or is it multiple, and
do I have to do work?

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.900
Can you just talk a little
bit about that?

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.710
RIDHIMA KEDIA: So you will
get two OAuth tokens.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.820
We'd recommend you keep the
later one, because it will

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:06.480
have the greater set
of permissions, and

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.830
revoke the older one.

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:09.790
And then go ahead and
use the later one.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.790
JONATHAN BERI: And we're also
looking at how to make that a

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:12.415
better experience.

00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:12.800
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Yeah.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.550
JONATHAN BERI: So keeping
following our blog and our

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.840
Google+ page to learn more
about how we're improving

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.340
authorization and APIs.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I built
an app for GitHub.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.890
And I have like 400 OAuth tokens
in there, and I didn't

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.300
realize I was doing that.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.845
So that's something that--

00:35:24.845 --> 00:35:26.580
yeah, great.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:26.885
Thanks.

00:35:26.885 --> 00:35:27.190
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.520
I like your app.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.000
This way.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.810
AUDIENCE: So what about a
progressive enhancement.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:40.140
I want to allow people to log
in with any OAuth provider

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.680
but, if they have a G+ account,
get the additional

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.750
capabilities.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.510
How would that work?

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.980
JONATHAN BERI: So when you mean
any OAuth provider, do

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.450
you mean outside of Google?

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.920
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.410
JONATHAN BERI: So we've seen
a few solutions in the

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.180
marketplace.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.960
Typically, it depends on which
type of networks you're trying

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.420
to target--

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.330
if it's a business oriented
product, if it's a consumer

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.240
oriented product, if you have
your own OAuth provider.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.740
But we think options is a good
thing, but not too many.

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.910
Because that creates the
paralysis of choice.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.580
So we're seeing usually maybe
two providers in a single

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.845
dialogue, depending
on which are your

00:36:13.845 --> 00:36:14.710
two greatest networks.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.500
And then you just can provide
them as options.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.630
And then on your back end,
you basically have

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.950
a table of a user.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:25.330
And it's this social login
versus Google social login,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.640
maybe username and password.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.400
And you can just keep it
as a unified record.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.050
AUDIENCE: So I would have to
have a Sign-In with G+ and a

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.030
Sign-In with Gmail if they just
had a Google account.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.280
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, I see.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:46.880
So one thing that I hope I can
convey is Google+ Sign-In is

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.510
the way we want developers to
allow users to connect their

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.330
Google account with
your service.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.730
So think of Google as
a Google Sign-In.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.640
It's a Google+ Sign-In,
but it's Sign-In

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.310
with your Google account.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.720
So you should use Google+
Sign-In as your Google way to

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.940
authenticate.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.850
If you want to, let's say,
support GitHub, then you could

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:06.290
provide that as a secondary
Sign-In option, and combine

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.560
the user accounts that way.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:08.850
Cool?

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.210
Good question.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.180
AUDIENCE: Hello, I think you
might have mentioned this, but

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.600
a really simple question.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.430
When you mentioned that for deep
links, if you don't have

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:23.130
the app, does Google Play do
anything to carry that

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.896
referring source through the
installation process?

00:37:26.896 --> 00:37:27.730
RIDHIMA KEDIA: Yes.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.310
JONATHAN BERI: Absolutely.

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.480
So on Android, if I'm on the
Android app, the new beautiful

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.580
Android app, I click
that deep link.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.760
If the user doesn't have your
app installed, we'll take them

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.020
to the Play Store, we'll prompt
them to install it.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.780
When they're done, they'll get
a notification saying, do you

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.250
want to continue to
that deep link?

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.210
So they'll actually go exactly
to the right deep link, and

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.990
we'll pass the deep
link to your app.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:48.880
Even on iOS, we help the user
go to the app store.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.060
And we help them get to the
final deep link, as well.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.320
AUDIENCE: OK, how does
it work on iOS?

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.900
Did you--

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.210
JONATHAN BERI: We can talk
more about the specifics.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.190
But essentially, we take them
to the app store, and we use

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.100
the [? pay span ?]

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.420
to get them as a saved link.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:05.650
And they can go all
the way through.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.050
So mostly, they get there.

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:08.862
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:38:08.862 --> 00:38:10.590
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.620
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
how flexible are

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:14.380
the actions or contexts?

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.910
I know there's probably
a standard set.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.030
But is there a way to
extend that set?

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.350
JONATHAN BERI: So start from
the beginning again.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.910
Sorry.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.700
AUDIENCE: I guess, how flexible
are the actions or

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.790
the deep links, the contexts?

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:28.140
JONATHAN BERI: OK, so the
interactive posts, the call to

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:28.765
action labels.

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:29.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.490
JONATHAN BERI: It
is a thick set.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.990
We have over 100 of what we've
heard are the most common.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.460
And we're always up to add some
more ones that you think

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.080
would help a larger
population.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.880
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.130
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.530
AUDIENCE: Basically, it's very
exciting to see the Sign-In

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.730
process to give access
to developers

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.100
for actual user data.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.750
When would you think that we'd
be able to get access for

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.960
friend data, so we could build
smarter algorithms for finding

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.925
out friend affinity or content
analysis and things like that

00:38:56.925 --> 00:38:59.620
off of say, the pages
that your friends

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.130
actually like on Google+.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.250
JONATHAN BERI: So in the
beginning, I talked about

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.005
security and privacy.

00:39:04.005 --> 00:39:04.360
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.210
JONATHAN BERI: And the model
we're building right now is

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.380
the user has to authenticate.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.480
And we're being very
conservative on what

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.390
user data you get.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.300
So when a user does sign in,
we allow them to give you

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.980
access to their flat Circles.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.230
And that includes the public
Google ID, first name, last

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.240
name, and profile picture.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.740
I don't know if we're ever going
to go to that direction,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:28.450
but we'd love to hear your use
cases and see how we can make

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:29.380
them happen.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.020
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.830
JONATHAN BERI: Cool, and I think
we're done for time.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.730
I'll be around here
after the talk.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.810
And of course, we have our
sandbox, where you can ask me

00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:38.480
and the rest of the team
more questions.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.320
