CHRIS HELLMANN: Hello and
welcome to the one before last

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.810
session on privileged access.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.910
That's why I brought
the [? Politsi ?]

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.690
tee shirt to give you, not
there, not there, we go there.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.180
So it has to be organized.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.300
So we've got a panel of
illustrious people here.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000
So we got Diana from Vodafone.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.560
We've got Paul Kinlan
from Google.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.093
We've got Petro Soininen--

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:26.650
PETRO SOININEN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.960
CHRIS HELLMANN: OK.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
Fair enough.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720
ex Nokia and now at Five.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.369
And as we didn't have enough
blanket statements and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.610
outrageous swearing, we actually
brought Brian Leroux

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.660
from PhoneGap with us as well
who is actually going to start

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.450
the whole session by
telling us-- for 10

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.890
minutes and not longer--

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.060
what we are all about here
about privileged access.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.535
So take it away.

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:50.930
Take your closed technology and
show us what you can do.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.385
BRIAN LEROUX: OK.

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:55.820
Can you guys hear
me all right?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.596
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:57.596 --> 00:00:58.040
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.860
Well except for old man Russell
in the front there.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.110
So I'm going to talk to you guys
today about privileged

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.760
applications, packaged
applications, sometimes we

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.700
call them installable
web applications.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.660
I've even heard it called
a thick client.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.190
So--

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.220
oh come on pointer events.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.830
There we go.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.380
I work on a PhoneGap project
which you may have heard of.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.930
It's for building apps using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.240
And it's very much like a
packaged application.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.400
You host the assets
on a device and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.750
we load them locally.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.740
They're intrinsically offline.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.450
And it's also a powerful
extensibility layer.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.380
So PhoneGap lets you get
at, basically, anything

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.750
the device can do.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.310
And that's what we're
talking about.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.600
So the question that we were
posing was, did the web solve

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.860
cross platform?

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.220
And I think when it comes to
things like screen sizes and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.150
operating systems, the
web did solve cross

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.300
platform really well.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.180
Somebody was talking about Steve
Jobs earlier when he

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.200
said, you're going to build
apps and you're going

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.400
to build web apps.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.390
And I love that.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
I thought that was
a great vision.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.790
But web didn't solve
everything.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.120
Web intrinsically is sandboxed,
and this is

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.960
actually not a bug.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.080
This is a feature.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.650
This is how the web works.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.140
But because it has this
capability or this feature

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.650
that it's sandboxed, it
also doesn't have

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.690
access to device APIs.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.480
And so it's at a disadvantage
when it comes to native

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.830
applications.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.780
It's sandboxing.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.660
I guess another disadvantage
of the web is that it can't

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.200
participate in app stores
which maybe

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
we'll talk about later.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230
I don't think this is exactly
what packaged

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.930
applications are all about.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.110
So I don't know if you guys have
noticed but there's this

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.360
trend lately towards web
operating systems.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.840
Google's got Chrome OS.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.710
Microsoft has Windows 8, which
uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.040
to build applications.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.740
Some guys called Mozilla
are doing a thing

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.590
called Firefox OS.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.770
There's this thing called Tizen,
which is an open source

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.956
web operating system by
Samsung and Intel.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:02:59.425
And then there's
Web OS from HP.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:01.160
It kind of makes me sad so
I don't like to talk

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.730
about it too much.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.730
But there's all these things.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.450
So if you think about Google,
Microsoft, Mozilla, Samsung,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.110
Intel, and HP are all betting
on the web for their next

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.760
operating systems which is a
pretty interesting thing.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.480
And these are all privileged
applications and packaged

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.240
applications.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.440
Mobile is not quite so kind, but
luckily, with PhoneGap we

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.680
can get to these things
and we can get

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.150
inside these app stores.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.030
And this is not a cheap shot--
this is just a statement of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.140
fact and it's kind
of interesting--

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.880
all of these app stores
themselves are web

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.580
applications.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.930
They're hybrid apps.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.720
You can't install an

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.800
application without the network.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.790
And typically when you're
browsing for apps in an app

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.610
store, you're going
to the web.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.330
So forgive me if you've heard
this before because packaged

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.460
apps are not a new concept.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.110
This has been around
a long time.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.490
It used to be widgets
inside of Vodafone.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.320
There's this thing called
confabulator from Yahoo.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.980
Think it was Yahoo.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.100
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.350
BRIAN LEROUX: It was Yahoo.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.150
Maybe this thing called AIR
from this other company.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.870
I can't remember who they are.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.300
The idea has been around
for a while though and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.670
it's not a new thing.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.600
So apps that are designed for
a particular platform are

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.345
incompatible by their nature.

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.640
If you build for a particular
operating system, you're not

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.540
going to ship it on other
operating system unless you

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.130
believe Blackberry 10, you can
put Android apps on it but

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.410
that's another thing
all together.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.070
So that's why we
have standards.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.779
That's the point of
web standards.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.410
And there's actually some
emergent standards that are

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.520
around this, and there's
some older ones too.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.100
So there's a thing called the
Widget Spec, which kind of

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.870
died in a horrible death, but
it's around in its own way.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.750
Bruce is going to cry.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.810
I'm sorry, Bruce.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.460
It's not around anymore.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.120
There's the device API Working
Group at the W3C that thought

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.540
we need all these device APIs.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.870
Let's standardize all this
stuff, but they didn't think

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.455
about the security model with
enabling things like camera

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:49.390
and contacts and all
these device APIs.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.270
So there's a new group now
called the System Applications

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.200
Working Group.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.220
And it's starting with the idea
of the runtime context

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.030
and security model.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.700
And I'll talk about that
in a little bit.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.870
So to be really clear, what
we're talking about here is

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.150
packaged web applications.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.600
We're not just talking about
packaged applications because

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.630
packaged applications
have happened

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.210
before and they've failed.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.880
The web is naturally
interoperable.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.160
The web has this DNA where
things are portable, and this

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.070
is what we're looking for.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.980
And this is why packaged web
applications are important.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.910
So this is where shit gets
a little bit boring.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.950
Every application, or every
packaged application has to

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:22.395
have a manifest.

00:05:22.395 --> 00:05:24.380
And a manifest is going to have
things like your title,

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.100
your icon, your license, your
author, the things we need to

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.020
know what to display
when we have a

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.530
springboard for the app.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.080
But then it starts to get a
little bit more interesting.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.850
It also has to have an origin
because we need to know where

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.320
to go to update it, which
kind of comes back

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.130
to the offline stuff.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.110
And it also needs to have white
listing for the network

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.640
because a packaged application
typically runs local on the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.210
device but it needs to
know where it can

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.640
go to go get data.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.780
Packaged applications also have
permissions for features.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.740
We don't want every application
to have access to

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.130
your front facing camera, and
so you have to be able to

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.960
declare this.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.940
Packaged applications are
also a runtime context.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.170
So in the case of PhoneGap, we
run on the file protocol.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.610
So file://indexHTML is
where we load stuff.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.000
But this means that all these
applications intrinsically can

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.450
do cross domain requests, which
is dangerous, which is

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.760
why we have to white listing.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.930
The runtime context also has
some weird properties that are

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.720
a little bit different than
other types of applications.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.480
So window.open, for example,
might open an in-app browser

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.200
instead spawning a new tab.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.680
File system locations can be
different, that kind of thing.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.000
Thank god there's beer.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.650
OK.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.400
So I'm trying to go
quick here, Chris.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.520
Apps live a really
weird lifecycle.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.710
So an application right now in
a browser, you open a tab, it

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.800
starts up, you're good to go.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.920
An application running in a
packaged application runs in

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.810
kind of these different modes
and so we have online and

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.480
offline events.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.100
I'm of the opinion that we
actually need more information

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.370
than just online and offline
but we can talk about that

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.810
over the beers later.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.570
We also have pause and resume
so there's something called

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.510
the page visibility API in the
web but it's a little bit

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.180
nascent right now.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.670
And it's the same thing, but
when you're looking at

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.970
applications that are running on
a phone, we can put them in

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.550
the background.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.760
They may or may not be able
to do anything about that.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.990
Then there's system
notifications.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.400
And so the classic example I
like to give here is a battery

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.350
notification event-- if your
battery is about to die, you

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.270
might want to back up
your information.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.240
We implemented this in PhoneGap
and unfortunately,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.560
polling the battery drained
the battery.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.900
So we didn't know what
to do to fix that.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.910
This is a property of packaged
applications too.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.100
So there's runtime security
beyond the sandbox and this is

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.830
where stuff is most
interesting.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.110
There's things like
network security.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.050
There's encrypted key stores
possibly on some devices where

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.640
you can store data on
the phone securely.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.330
And that's where we get
to device APIs.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.240
So I like to put device
APIs into two buckets.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.360
You've got system sensors
and you've got data.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.270
Sensors are things like your
camera, your accelerometer,

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.430
your geolocation, and
that kind of stuff.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.760
GPS.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.080
Data is like your file, your
contacts, your media.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.110
That's what we want to get at.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.780
That's what the web
can't do today.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.850
And that's where the web needs
to go if it wants to compete

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.740
with the native platforms
that are out there.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.780
And that's why we're seeing
all this work going into

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.380
standardization.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.700
So all this stuff is cool and
everybody wants it, but if

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.720
we're not careful, we're
going to shoot

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.200
ourselves in the face.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.720
And this is why runtime
security

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.970
context is super important.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.090
Awesome, right?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.410
I just wanted to use that GIF.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.428
It's all I got.

00:08:25.428 --> 00:08:26.678
Thanks.

00:08:31.642 --> 00:08:34.039
Do you want to leave that?

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.130
CHRIS HELLMANN: It might be a
bit annoying after a while.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.210
Let's just switch to
something nicer.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.059
How do I type Mozilla's hiring?

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.169
No.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.049
OK.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.820
It's good when you get the
speakers drunk first because

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.853
then they're much faster
than normally.

00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:48.460
BRIAN LEROUX: Did
I go too quick?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:48.780
CHRIS HELLMANN: No.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.430
That's OK.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.000
We've got more time for
questions then.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.300
That's pretty good.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.210
So as you said, it's an
interesting concept because I

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.330
spent the last few months now
talking about Firefox OS to

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.560
people and talking about
packaged apps to people.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:06.080
And every time you talk about
web apps and people are like,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.770
what is that?

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.060
I don't quite understand it and
it seems to be this hybrid

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.650
that people just don't
get around first.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:18.210
So to start with that, what do
you think is the main thing

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.530
that keeps us from having proper
apps that could be, in

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.030
terms of privileges,
on par with

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.530
native apps at the moment?

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.990
Is it an understanding
problem?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.060
Is it that every provider has
a different manifest format?

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.670
Is it that people just don't
trust web apps yet?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.370
What do you think is the biggest
barrier that we have

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:39.970
to overcome?

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.190
Let's go through
you one by one.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.640
Diana, what do think?

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:43.890
DIANA CHENG: OK.

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.290
There are few things.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.520
Application packaging
is an issue.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.082
It's completely fragmented
at the moment.

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:50.560
Yeah.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.490
This is the way I'm supposed
to hold it.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.370
Another issue is security.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.280
So everything that runs
in the browser has to

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.950
have limited access.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.620
So as has been mentioned,
[INAUDIBLE] had a different

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.190
device APIs.

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:12.630
Working Group had a different
surface [? cope ?] first and

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.930
it was called device APIs and
policy working group.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.020
And then the policy bit got
dropped because websites are

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.810
intrinsically--

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.770
or you have to assume that
they're going to be malicious,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.110
that they can do
a lot of harm.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.756
So they cannot get write
access to a lot

00:10:28.756 --> 00:10:31.300
of data on the device.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.890
They need to be sandboxed
and all that.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.480
So we need a different
sort of runtime.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.730
We need a security model.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.560
You know that the new working
group is working on new APIs

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.130
that have extended permissions
that will be installable, that

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.980
will, hopefully, be certified
by an app

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.240
store, will be signed.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.590
And this is one of the
things that is new.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.650
And it's great that we have
implementations like Firefox

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.000
OS and they're going to
put this in the wild.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.110
It's not going to
be just specs.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.580
It's going to be an
implementation.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.880
CHRIS HELLMANN: Cool.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.135
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:14.135 --> 00:11:17.600
So I think the biggest thing
for me is we haven't got a

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.550
unified permissions model.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.520
We don't know.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.490
If you're on the open web and
you're kind of driving past a

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.790
URL, we haven't got anything
that's even slightly

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.800
considered compatible
across browsers.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.870
And I also think we haven't even
dealt with the fact that

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.210
a lot of the things that
we want to do in native

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.970
applications we want to do
with things like USB.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.300
And we don't even know how
to like opt the user

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.220
into access a device.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:45.270
In Chrome, we've got the ability
to query some device

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.770
ID to see if it's present on the
USB bus and then you can

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.270
open it up and read
and write to it.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.300
But we're still trying to make
sure that we've got that

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.000
permissions model quite right.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.204
BRIAN LEROUX: And isn't
that like a

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:56.220
fingerprinting issue too?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.530
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.310
Well, that's actually why it
changed relatively recently.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.800
Well, not exactly
why it changed.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:02.708
BRIAN LEROUX: You've
accepted that

00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:04.524
fingerprinting is going to happen?

00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:07.200
PAUL KINLAN: Well I think
everyone always has to accept

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.520
fingerprinting at some point
is going to happen.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.415
You can look at the EFF website
or whatever it is and

00:12:11.415 --> 00:12:13.490
they'll show you all the unique
characteristics of your

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.440
normal browsing session.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.070
The thing from the USB side of
things is that we're trying to

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.850
get to this place where, maybe
in the manifest, you say that

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.020
this application can have access
to your Fitbit or those

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.980
types of different devices
because you normally have a

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.420
vendor ID and a product ID.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.740
And then that might actually put
people off from actually

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.950
installing the application,
especially if

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.570
they don't have it.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.430
So we're starting to also move
to this idea of a runtime

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:40.670
permissions model for those
types of things.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.720
And I don't think any of the
browser vendors have even got

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.710
to any level of consistency.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.190
That's my biggest thing.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:48.470
CHRIS HELLMANN: Cool.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.620
PETRO SOININEN: I think for me
it's the thing that even if

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.080
you actually understand what
the hybrid concept or the

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.000
package web app concept is, is
that a lot of the customers

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.410
that we work with just say that
they don't have enough

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.980
experience or enough examples
of packaged web apps that

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.680
actually do deliver the
UX that they're

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:11.580
going to be happy with.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.330
So I think that we still lack
real showcases and real kick

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.170
ass applications that
actually deliver.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.890
CHRIS HELLMANN: Which is quite
bizarre because seeing that

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.400
even in the native markets,
a lot of them are actually

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.560
packaged apps with PhoneGap.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.570
They're just not advertised
as those.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.370
BRIAN LEROUX: That's right.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.190
Yeah.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.546
CHRIS HELLMANN: And some AIR
ones as well, funnily enough.

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:33.340
BRIAN LEROUX: Tons.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.442
CHRIS HELLMANN: Yeah.

00:13:35.442 --> 00:13:38.800
So the questions to moderator
are actually all going around

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.330
the same topic, which is the
biggest topic that everybody

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.160
has to deal with, how do I make
my end users realize that

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.320
they're giving permission
right now?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.050
Do we really need to ask for
permission for everything?

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.430
And how do we make sure we don't
overload people with a

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.750
question every time they
do one action?

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:58.120
Do you want to move
the mouse left?

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.700
Are you sure?

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.080
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.820
CHRIS HELLMANN: These
kind of things.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.890
Where do we draw the line?

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.910
What is the real problem
with that?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.820
BRIAN LEROUX: This is the key
issue to me because we don't

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.200
want to have web Vista where
it's like asking permission

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.030
for everything.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.430
Can I access your camera?

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.600
Can I access your contacts?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.000
Can I use your file system?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.780
That user experience
would totally suck.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.840
At the same time, we don't want
the user experience to be

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.380
website XXX has access to my
front facing camera and my

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.180
contacts, and yeah, we don't
have to go any further with

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.385
that analogy to know that
that's a bad thing.

00:14:31.385 --> 00:14:31.820
CHRIS HELLMANN: Speak
for yourself.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.750
BRIAN LEROUX: So browser vendors
are challenged by this

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.420
too because I think Google's
proposing something.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.160
They're trying to come up with
language in the system

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.450
applications working group.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.610
How do we have this thing called
like a trust gesture

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.390
where you say to the browser,
hey, I trust this thing maybe

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.130
one time, or I trust it
for all the time.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.280
We wanted to be able to get back
to those permissions and

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.430
look at them and maybe revoke
them possibly in case website

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.000
XXX turns a new leaf.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.610
CHRIS HELLMANN: It's also
no timely access.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.790
It always seems like it would
be a black and white thing.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.020
I give access and that's it,
but I could grant, for

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.460
example, a guest pass for an
app to access my camera for

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.230
the next five minutes and then
I have to revoke that again,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.130
or it revokes automatically.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.730
I mean, Flickr had this for
guest access to your photos,

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.640
for example, that you could
send somebody a string and

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.020
like within an hour they could
look at your stuff but after

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.790
an hour they can't
login anymore.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.260
That would be another
way of dealing with

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.860
that, wouldn't it?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.700
That I could say, OK, for the
next five minutes I want to

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.040
try that app out but after that,
you don't get access to

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.440
the camera anymore.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.900
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, we could,
but that exists anyway, right,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.070
in the sense that if you do a
get-user media it normally

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.580
pops up a little bar
across the top.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.320
It's because the hardware
manufacturer actually puts a

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.690
little LED at the front so you
know it's on, it's actually

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.220
doing stuff.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.050
But once you actually finish
with the stream, then it

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.570
closes down.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.310
The next time that you request
it you get the

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.250
prompt again normally.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.180
CHRIS HELLMANN: Yeah.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:54.510
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.240
I look at kind of having to
re-grant storage permissions

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.730
and increase storage.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.470
People just press the buttons
normally and we don't know

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.400
what's going to happen, right?

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.880
BRIAN LEROUX: That's the
Android problem.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.190
It's like, oh, this app wants
to do everything.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:07.510
Cool.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.436
Install.

00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:10.210
That's what happens.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.538
Then, later on, you don't know
what permissions you've

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:14.435
granted this thing because you
can't find it because it's

00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:16.660
buried in the system.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.620
CHRIS HELLMANN: One good
question was also when you

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.050
look at Facebook, for example,
you can give access to

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.080
everything in the world.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.850
Then this app turns out to be
evil and you can actually stop

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.700
that access.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.900
So you have a dashboard of all
the apps and what access they

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.210
have to which device.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.115
So there's a centralized
way of doing that.

00:16:32.115 --> 00:16:34.700
Would that be a solution that
we could think about?

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.560
That instead of every app having
to ask these things, I

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.750
have a dashboard of this
app has access

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.690
to these five things.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.520
So you have one grid on your
system that actually allows

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.180
you to control all of that.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:48.306
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

00:16:48.306 --> 00:16:52.060
I think I'm in this on
the previous kind of

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.010
proposal that you make.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.930
They both make sense.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.690
And there are a lot of
other good ideas on

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:57.490
this front as well.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.440
But I think one of the key
things is also just to make

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.210
sure that users actually
understand what are they

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.819
accepting and then, again,
the mechanisms--

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.540
how they can actually
control it.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.500
So as you said, that they're
probably just going to be

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.738
pressing the OK, OK, OK and
not really think about it.

00:17:12.738 --> 00:17:14.349
But that's not really
technology.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:18.200
It's more like psychology and
trying to figure out how

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.470
humans think.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.550
BRIAN LEROUX: Paul , you were
talking about this at lunch.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:26.920
You guys had difficulty with
the messaging or something.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.630
If you look at the way that we
have our installable kind of

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.040
hosted apps and packaged apps
in the next packaged apps,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.190
essentially, we have had kind
of this messaging issue.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.600
If you go to install the
application, and you're on,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.160
say, the detail page, it'll
tell you all the

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.510
things that it does.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.030
I don't know how many users
actually look at that.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.840
But when you press install,
there are at least three

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.650
different levels of ways that
we prompt the user.

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.030
So for some things like
unlimited storage, which is a

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.810
permission that you can have,
we don't even tell the user.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.210
It's just kind of assumed.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.680
There is, to your point before,
there's actually a

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.390
dashboard inside Chrome where
you can normally access like

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.430
the levels of permissions that
your applications have and

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.550
revoke them.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.100
But normally, when you revoke
something, it means

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.230
uninstalling the application.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.670
So that's a different
part as well.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:14.900
CHRIS HELLMANN: Is it
an innovation thing?

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.230
Because we had app cache, then
we had local storage, then we

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.760
have Nxdb, then we got web SQL,
and we put an interface

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.510
for each of them in the browser
rather than having one

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.350
interface for storage and saying
OK, this app wants to

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.870
store stuff offline, wants to
store things in a database,

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.710
and wants to store things
only for this session.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.420
Do you want to allow this?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.390
Is it now the time to actually
look at all the browsers again

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.720
and find a unified interface
for that?

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.500
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, there's
also this idea of quota system

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.140
which has been banging around
for a little while.

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.870
You can request some storage
or an increase in unlimited

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.630
storage, for instance, and
it goes across all of the

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.720
different types of persistence
mechanisms that you have

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.460
inside the browser.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.360
BRIAN LEROUX: Is that
the Quota API?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:52.640
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.240
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.050
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.190
These things exist.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.710
We just don't think we've
got consensus

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.960
amongst the vendors yet.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.130
I don't know what we do
other than talk more.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.480
CHRIS HELLMANN: Diana,
you wanted to--

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.710
DIANA CHENG: Yeah.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.030
I just wanted to say with
regards to that, it's a

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.270
difficult thing to agree on
because there is no place to

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.920
agree on that.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.700
So this is not something you
can write on a spec.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.160
Right?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.780
On the spec you write things
that are testable, that are

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.190
verifiable, but you don't
test UI stuff.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.050
Even in geolocation there was
only so much we could ask.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.700
You should specify the host of
the site that is requesting

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.340
the permission and
you show that.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.380
But it's very, very hard to find
a place where you make

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.270
people agree on this.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.990
CHRIS HELLMANN: So during lunch,
we talked about widgets

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.150
already and I remember
both Vodaphone--

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.360
I worked back then on it-- and
Opera were the first ones to

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.200
do W3C widgets to actually
have little apps on your

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.410
desktop that can run even
when Opera was closed.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.590
So that didn't take on.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.300
Why do you think?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.270
We needed the app model on
mobile phones for people to go

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.600
back to the app idea?

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.840
Or is it just that on a desktop
nobody understood the

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.905
concept of having an app that
actually is in web standards?

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.470
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know what
the official answer is, but

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.870
it's like just generally
widget was a

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.400
weird word, for one.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.920
It didn't denote anything like
an installable application for

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.500
me at least when I was
looking at it.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.110
BRIAN LEROUX: I believe they're
an evangelism team.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.854
AUDIENCE: At the time somebody
begged them to change the

00:20:28.854 --> 00:20:30.320
stupid name.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:30.790
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.210
If you look at the spec, a lot
of this stuff is very similar

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:36.790
across all the manifests that we
have apart from it's an XML

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.040
and not in the JavaScript
notation.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.880
It's kind of interesting.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.890
CHRIS HELLMANN: So one question
that people had was,

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.710
now that every single app
platform, like packaged app

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.810
platform in HTML has a different
manifest file, is

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:55.480
there a way to actually
automate that?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.900
Is there already a script
out there--

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:57.306
PAUL KINLAN: Appmeter.com.

00:20:57.306 --> 00:20:59.290
CHRIS HELLMANN: --to generate
all of them?

00:20:59.290 --> 00:20:59.560
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.920
We made one called Appmeter
which did Chrome apps, that

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.210
was very specific to Chrome apps
but Firefox apps aren't

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.710
too dissimilar.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.060
I think, Bruce, you had one?

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:08.530
Or you--

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.722
AUDIENCE: Scott Wilson from
Apache Project had--

00:21:11.722 --> 00:21:12.178
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:21:12.178 --> 00:21:13.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
translate Chrome.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:13.625
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:16.290
There's been a couple of these
ones where the core

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.720
functionality in most
of the browsers is

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.830
pretty much the same.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.960
We are diverging now a little
bit where we're starting to

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.240
get more hardware access.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.640
But we're still, as an industry,
exploring what that

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.560
means and kind of what
that entails.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.740
But yeah, we've had the ability
to kind of convert

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.850
between them but I've not seen
a huge appetite for it.

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.230
BRIAN LEROUX: We've got a
library called Confetti in the

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.470
PhoneGap project that
will spit out all

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.610
the different formats.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.990
So instead of trying to push
an agenda on one format, we

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:44.864
just decided we would
support all of them.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.430
CHRIS HELLMANN: It's interesting
because the apps

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.090
themselves are they
that different?

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:54.460
It's like, can you just build
one app and just render it on

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.550
all the different platforms?

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.580
Because if we're not
inter-compatible in HTML5

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.530
itself, then we can not really
tell the native clients off

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.030
that they're on.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.710
DIANA CHENG: Besides from the
manifest format, I don't know.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.360
I mean, the technologies
are the same.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.680
It's a package directory.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.080
And I think since Alex is at the
front that maybe this is

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.560
something that TAG could
address, like the

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.310
fragmentation, in terms
of packaging format.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.880
It's a long term problem in the
W3C and it would be good

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.000
to find solutions.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.370
BRIAN LEROUX: Save the
internet, Alex.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.470
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.120
Yeah so we've got different APIs
at the moment as well.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.750
Fundamentally, I think Mozilla's
got the web API

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.430
system and we've got our
own Chrome name space.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.470
Until that kind of settles down
and we know exactly what

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.860
we need from APIs.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.400
A normal web application, like
something that you would

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.200
expect to get in your browser
but that's got a little bit of

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.440
installability and all this type
of stuff, we've probably

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.260
got broadly compatible across
a lot of these platforms.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.560
It's when you get to these new
bits like UDP, TCP, USB,

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.700
Bluetooth, these things that
people want from their native

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.370
applications, but we don't
have access to

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.430
them inside the browser.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.130
We have to work on that
all together.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.400
CHRIS HELLMANN: Shouldn't
they already want to?

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.450
Isn't the big problem that I
can't take a photo at the

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.130
moment across browsers?

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.190
Aren't we already thinking about
the hard projects where

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:17.770
we don't even have parity with
native apps at the moment?

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.950
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, the latest
browsers we can take

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.670
photos and we can save
them in the gallery.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:22.600
We can do these things.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.110
We might have not done a greater
job at evangelizing

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.610
these bits--

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.190
CHRIS HELLMANN: Well then,
do it in the iPhone.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.050
PAUL KINLAN: You can, in the
latest one, I think.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:30.470
BRIAN LEROUX: You can.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:31.530
Media capture is there.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.260
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:32.770
Input type.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:34.810
BRIAN LEROUX: It's [INAUDIBLE]
user media but it's input type

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:35.710
in the camera.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.530
It declared [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:38.880
CHRIS HELLMANN: OK.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.950
Question there?

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:40.490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.050
[? Jonas Sicking ?]

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.130
from Mozilla.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.970
I've done a lot of work on that
platform for Firefox OS

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.620
including the web
APIs and so on.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.590
One of the reasons we don't have
compatible manifests, is

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.500
that we haven't actually
tried.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.960
The device API group went off
and did all the APIs but it's

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.100
kind of like they came at it
from the wrong way of not

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.190
doing the runtime first which
is why there was no common

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.450
ground to sort of build these
things on top of it.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.510
The sys apps working group is
the first real time we're

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:12.780
actually trying to standardize
the packaging format, the

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.950
runtime model.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.730
There are proposals a couple
of them including one from

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.800
Mozilla for defining a
standardized manifest and

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.900
packaging format and so on.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.390
I also wanted, since I
have the microphone--

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.180
the app model in Firefox
OS is absolutely not

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.860
packaged apps only.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.420
We do a lot to enable web
applications to run just like

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.345
a normal website runs today, but
as much as possible enable

00:24:45.345 --> 00:24:48.170
it offline, which it's not quite
there yet but we are

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.360
hoping to get it there.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.460
BRIAN LEROUX: I honestly don't
think it's an issue either.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.070
It's just a metafile format.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.510
And it's kind of the
most boring bits.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.130
The permissions is going to be
the thing that needs be solved

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.450
and the rest of it's like
where's your app icons and

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.870
what's the title on the
springboard and that type of

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:05.830
thing which is--

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.700
PAUL KINLAN: There's also the
point that [? Jonas ?]

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.160
mentioned a second
ago is offline.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.350
That was like the very first
thing that we tried to do in

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.390
the next version of Chrome Maps
is make sure the offline

00:25:13.390 --> 00:25:15.760
is kind of deep like baked in
completely, which means that

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.630
we've gone away on that side of
things from like the hosted

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.690
model right now.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.110
But we thought that was the
biggest thing because if you

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:27.290
move into phones and iPad,
iPhone, and Android, it's a

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.070
different development model.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.680
You're offline straight away and
then you need [? to put ?]

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.440
online functionality
into your app.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.050
And we believe that, at least
for installable apps right

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.010
now, that's the way we
should be going.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.960
CHRIS HELLMANN: One question
here is, to go back into the

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.150
UX what everybody asked about,
how do we ensure that people

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.760
know the impact of what
they're granting?

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.700
How do we make sure that people
don't go through the

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.200
Android way of like yeah,
yeah, yeah, I give you

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.870
everything because I want to
throw these birds at those

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.120
pigs or whatever?

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:00.370
Isn't it the problem
that we have?

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.880
Like already the press is saying
that HTML5 will never

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.610
be secure and native is secure
and when we start actually

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.830
advertising like, yeah, there's
things you shouldn't

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.780
give grant access to.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:14.250
Would there be a bad backlash
towards the platform?

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.560
BRIAN LEROUX: It's an education
issue absolutely.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.700
We have to teach people what
these things mean.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.160
And I think we're going to have
to teach people how to

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.760
use their devices in
a responsible way.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.740
And that's probably going to,
unfortunately, take a massive

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.980
privacy fail before we can truly
appreciate how important

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.280
these things are.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.590
DIANA CHENG: One thing that many
people claim, and that I

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:37.640
actually agree for
certain APIs is

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.360
through keeping the locality.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.250
So the relationship between the
permission and the action

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.440
that needs this permission makes
it clearer to the user.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.760
So having an API that allows you
to specify up front for a

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.970
website or web app what are all
of the permissions and for

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.240
the user to approve them in a
batch might not be the best

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.250
for all applications.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.920
It could work in many cases.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.890
If I just want your
location, then why

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.590
would I ask this upfront?

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:10.380
I want to be asked for this when
I actually want to see my

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.230
location with relation to
my car in a map, right?

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.010
So that helps the
user, I think.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.720
CHRIS HELLMANN: Well,
that's the power of

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.390
the web, isn't it?

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.520
The immediacy and the on demand
delivery of content and

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.340
on demand delivery
of functionality.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.280
Whereas, with packaged
apps and native apps,

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.370
we don't have that.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:28.020
It's like one app per thing
that does it perfectly.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.810
That's fine but I have to
install an app to convert

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.730
Celsius and Fahrenheit where I
could enter that in Google in

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.940
the search bar as well and
get the same result.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.920
So the question is, how do we
make people aware that the web

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.500
apps can't do more than that?

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.060
With packaged apps, don't we
just simulate what the other

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.540
apps are doing but we don't
have the same access to

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:53.690
hardware and we can't give
the same experience?

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.050
BRIAN LEROUX: Well, with the
PhoneGap hack we're just

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.040
utilizing what the operating
system does.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.450
So in the case of Apple,
the security

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.940
model is to be reviewed.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.630
In the case of Android, the
security model is to have a

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.640
permissions manifest.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.480
And then that's all we can do.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.540
Chrome apps, Windows 8 apps,
all these new web operating

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.050
systems, Firefox OS, this is the
opportunity to define this

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.510
and teach people.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:24.490
So basically what I'm saying is,
that's your guys' problem.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.030
CHRIS HELLMANN: Because the
issue is I scare a lot of

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.180
users off when I just show
them like I want to have

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.390
access to 20 things.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.180
This app can do this
and that and that.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:38.530
Whereas, if the usage of the app
is basic and later on they

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.050
go to other levels and
need more access.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.670
And then, the question
should come.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.640
But that's again, a UX
problem, isn't it?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.850
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.640
You have to work it out.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.400
It's actually a really complex
problem because you've got

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.100
different times that you might
want elevated access, like the

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.570
unlimited storage one is we can
let you know at install

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.040
time that this application's
got unlimited storage.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.240
I don't think we do at the
moment for that one, but there

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.290
are other ones like when you can
do cross domain requests

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.450
without breaking out the normal
site, like the sandbox,

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.590
like the domain isolation
at least.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.620
We let you know at install time
that this application can

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.650
do that, but it all depends
on the message that we do.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.780
If you put one or two sites
in, we'll tell you you can

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.360
access Twitter.com, it
can access Facebook.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:23.940
But if you put 10 different
like domain sources in, we

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:27.000
basically say this application
can access the

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.710
content of your sites.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.860
Because you can't list all 20.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.220
And especially when it's like
a weird regular expression

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.270
which is *.Facebook.com/*.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.850
Like normal users aren't going
to even know what that means.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.400
They're just going to see some
weird stuff when they install

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.110
it which increases the
likelihood that they'll just

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:47.310
click OK without understanding
the ramifications.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.960
AUDIENCE: I believe greatly in
the belief you should give

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.560
control to users.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.040
This is a question regarding
to the permission system.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.340
So I'm wondering about the
problem with education

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.760
regarding the user.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.920
The problem I see is that
there's no control to use

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.240
actually at the moment.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.180
Users giving a question
regarding giving access to all

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.310
of these permissions without
[INAUDIBLE] actually giving

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.590
updates set on the specific
permissions.

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.660
They don't wan to give access
to contacts, for example.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:22.220
I think that should
be possible.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.710
CHRIS HELLMANN: Yeah.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.490
The question is you have to give
all permissions and if

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.860
you don't give one of them, you
just don't get the app,

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.950
rather than it should be up to
you which ones to give and the

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.200
app should apply to that or
the app should change

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.290
accordingly?

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:36.520
BRIAN LEROUX: I think Chrome
got this [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.300
PAUL KINLAN: We're exploring
that at the moment where you

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.640
can request access.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.450
Basically, it's an optional
permission where you can

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.190
request access.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.690
You have it in the manifest so
you know the application's at

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.010
least going to ask for
it at some point.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:51.850
And then when you come to ask
for it, you can ask the user

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:53.500
are they sure they want
to do this action.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.290
I think the problem it comes
down to is, one, it's

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.240
relatively awkward to tell
developers to go and do this

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.780
and the easier one is just to
put the non-optional optional

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.840
permissions in.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:04.870
It all depends on the
functionality

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.500
of the app as well.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.810
If the app can live with
it, then it's fine.

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.480
If it can't live with it, what's
the point of installing

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.920
the app if you need access to
the camera and then every so

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.320
often you don't give access
to the camera.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.090
I don't quite know.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.480
CHRIS HELLMANN: In Firefox
OS, we've got

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.370
three different levels.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.910
We've got an app that you host
yourself which only has access

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.040
to the things that the browser
has in there now as well like

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.930
local storage and geolocation.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.730
And then we have an app that
has to go through the

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.700
marketplace and we have an app
that only Mozilla and partners

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.340
can do that get access to like
telephony and sending text

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.840
messages and things.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:37.560
Is that a good idea or is it
maybe something other people

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.420
should mimic?

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.960
Because the one size fits all,
that app can access everything

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.160
or nothing, is not getting us
anywhere at the moment.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.740
People want to host things on
their own server but they also

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.680
want to get access
to the hardware.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.900
BRIAN LEROUX: I like
that model too.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.050
I think these things
are compatible.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.260
If people happen to be running
Chrome right now, you could

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.390
click on the favicon icon, and
you can get this contacts menu

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.460
in your desktop browser that
shows you all these different

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:04.990
permissions.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.550
And I think this is the early
manifestation of these ideas,

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.250
but it is an all or nothing.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.050
You don't have this idea of
different levels of privilege,

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:17.130
the system apps, user apps, wild
west apps, I guess, would

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.350
be the third part.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.350
And then there's like the idea
of federation in app stores.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.440
So right now app stores are all
walled gardens per vendor,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.910
essentially, but it
makes no sense.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.610
Why is EA getting permission
from Apple to ship a game?

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.700
It's crazy, right?

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.920
EA should have its own store.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.570
I trust EA.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.330
I want to play games.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.650
CHRIS HELLMANN: Well if only we
had an open marketplace API

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.260
but I'm not going to talk about
that now, but you can

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.130
ask me later.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:46.630
What is interesting about this
is that you said like I trust

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.300
EA, but you can't trust
any server.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.400
It doesn't really matter
who it is.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.980
It's like larger companies
can get their

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.100
service hacked as well.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.570
It's just a matter of
how do you do it

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.320
unless you host it yourself?

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.890
And that, to me, is the main
crux of the matter.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.510
I just got an update on an
Android app that asked me for

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.090
1.81 gig update.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.120
And you're like, you haven't
understood mobile devices, did

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:12.860
you because I only got 8 gig
on this machine anyway.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.710
So how could we do an app that
are already granted access to

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.410
allow it to update
automatically, to only get

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.600
parts, to load a new level, to
load to new extra in a game

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.250
rather than replace the whole
packaging system?

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.460
I think that is failing
on the web.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.210
I don't want to download
an app every

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.520
time there is a change.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.850
But the change should be in
an extra API somehow.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.060
BRIAN LEROUX: That's an
imperative API for the cache

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.260
manifest would do that.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.150
So you could do delta updating
which I think is the stuff

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.860
that Alex and Jake have
been proposing.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:45.430
Yeah.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.230
It's a big issue.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.540
So PhoneGap apps have this
one all the time.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.920
We have a game and that game
could be gigabytes.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.990
They only want to load the first
level because you want

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.080
to be available over the network
and if the user gets

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.090
to level two in whatever game
they're playing, then download

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.400
those assets then.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.320
It's a huge issue for sure.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.560
AUDIENCE: I think when we were
talking on the permission

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.300
stuff, I can give a very short
run down on what we're doing

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:18.330
in Firefox OS, which is we
essentially have two types of

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.670
privileges for APIs.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.889
We have APIs where the user gets
asked the question very

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:27.780
similar to GPS and
geolocation.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.090
But there's a lot of APIs where
we just can't ask the

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.788
user, like asking the user do
you want to allow this app to

00:34:32.788 --> 00:34:33.639
use TCP socket?

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.790
It doesn't mean anything.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.510
So for those types of APIs where
we didn't feel we could

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:43.560
ask the user, we have to do it
through a review process which

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.239
is very unfortunate.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:48.420
Because it does mean that it's
much more similar to the iOS

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.350
model where it has to be someone
that is a trusted

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.260
party that has actually
done code reviews.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.590
Code reviews doesn't really work
but it's kind of the only

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.790
thing we have right now.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.800
We sort of have a third model
where it has to go both

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.110
through code review and we ask
the user where the code review

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:07.310
sort of covers the security
aspect and the asking the user

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.350
covers the privacy aspect.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.170
But these are sort of
the models we have.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.140
The code review part does mean
that it has to be a packaged

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.850
app because that's the only
way to ensure that the

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.920
reviewed code is what's actually
being executed.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.040
But that's something we'd like
to figure out but this is the

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.080
first iteration.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.010
CHRIS HELLMANN: One question
also on moderator was an

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.780
interesting one that says, I
trust the cam app from Google.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.510
Why don't we have apps that are
trusted for the access and

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.030
go through those rather
than having

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.550
the app itself contacted?

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.040
I don't want to put the dagger
in but Web Intents did

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.420
something like that,
didn't it?

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.165
Because I already knew I had
stuff on my mobile phone that

00:35:50.165 --> 00:35:51.210
I could take pictures with.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.140
Why can't I get the picture
from that app rather than

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.240
having to ask for permission
to access the camera?

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.730
Web activities do that, and in
the browser, input type camera

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:02.800
does the same thing.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.780
But an app cannot access it
the same way as far as I

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.290
understand it.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.160
Wouldn't that be a way around
that every operating system

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.500
comes with apps that are trusted
for different access

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.860
to different parts and
it goes through a

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.970
security level that way?

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.780
BRIAN LEROUX: Do it, Paul.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.500
Go.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.350
PAUL KINLAN: I actually
don't know the answer.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.980
People want natively integrated
experiences like

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.610
inside their app.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.490
They would like the camera to
be there so that they can

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.580
apply a little fish-eye effect
to it and make their face look

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.260
big and all these types of
things in real time.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.630
And we could go down the Intent
model of you delegate

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.620
the functionality to a
trusted application.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.490
That's fine, but people want
to integrate it into their

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.140
experience, and I don't
know how you delegate

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.520
between both scenarios.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.740
Maybe have an activity
Intent-like system at

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.145
the same time as--

00:36:49.145 --> 00:36:49.630
I don't know.

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:51.730
I think people get confused by
having to switch between apps

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:53.110
all the time.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.360
If you're having all
this functionality.

00:36:57.308 --> 00:36:58.020
I don't know.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.980
You've got to get broad
consensus across every single

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.800
different type of platform
about well

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.780
how do I access contacts?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.990
Do I go to the contact kind
of like contact manager?

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:07.410
Well, obviously if we have 10
different types of contact

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.743
managers, it's a desktop
machine and all

00:37:08.743 --> 00:37:11.845
this type of stuff.

00:37:11.845 --> 00:37:12.330
I don't know.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.580
CHRIS HELLMANN: Especially
with contacts it's an

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:17.510
interesting one because the
interface is optimized for

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.280
doing contacts so why should
any app build their own

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.620
contact manager on
top of that?

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:23.820
PAUL KINLAN: Well it's not
necessarily contact manager.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.630
It's like people want to share
invites to their friends on

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.120
different networks and all
this type of stuff.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.230
There's loads of different use
cases where you want to

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:38.070
integrate it directly into the
experience and that's why you

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.370
don't delegate out.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.300
CHRIS HELLMANN: We had
a twitch over there.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:43.559
Munir, did you want
to say something?

00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:44.545
MUNIR: Yeah.

00:37:44.545 --> 00:37:45.795
[INAUDIBLE].

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.580
CHRIS HELLMANN: As you see in
the Firefox tee shirt, he

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.936
actually works on the
web APIs as well.

00:37:52.936 --> 00:37:54.424
MUNIR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:54.424 --> 00:37:57.950
So I'd actually [INAUDIBLE]
exactly solving the issue you

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.050
are mentioning.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.590
If an app can't do something,
[INAUDIBLE] are doing

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.780
something, permissions or
something, like sending an SMS

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:10.790
in Firefox OS, only the
system can do that.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:15.226
You can just call that web
[INAUDIBLE] and system app

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:19.440
already has some behavior that
is secure like showing the

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.485
So all activity should
resolve [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:23.485 --> 00:38:26.250
where not want to
do some issue.

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.776
Web Intent has [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:30.628
or Intent on Android.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.200
CHRIS HELLMANN: Another
question we had, what

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.030
granularity should permissions
be at?

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.400
Obviously having separate
permissions for app cache and

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.400
local storage is overkill,
but do we need any

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.510
granularity at all?

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.290
Would a single privilege status
be enough, like can

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.890
take photos, can't take live
video, for example?

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.270
Shall we complicate this more
than it is already?

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.570
DIANA CHENG: I was going to say
granularity makes UI very

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:57.300
complicated.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:00.800
And that's something we want
to avoid because developers

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.700
don't like presenting
prompts to the user.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.030
That has been proven.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:07.390
They want to avoid it.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:12.240
So the more complicated the UI,
the least developers are

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.640
going to want to use
any APIs really.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:15.860
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.840
I think it comes down to what
Paul said earlier that if you

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.980
start having gazillion lines
in your prompt asking about

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.340
cryptic things no one is
going to understand

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.140
what it actually means.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:31.240
So there has to be a way to
try to keep it simple and

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.350
actually understandable
for the user.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.760
CHRIS HELLMANN: It's an
interesting task for the UX

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.790
people out there, isn't it?

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.160
It's like how to explain
something that complex in very

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.990
simple words and then translate
it into foreign

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:41.420
languages as well.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:41.606
PETRO SOININEN: Yeah.

00:39:41.606 --> 00:39:44.620
Plus when you take into account
potential kind of

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.560
different legislation
in some areas.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.950
For example, in China you might
have totally different

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:52.310
requirements on what kind of
privacy things you actually

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.015
need to ask from the user.

00:39:54.015 --> 00:39:55.970
And for example, if you
use the same service

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:58.290
in Germany or whatever.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:58.430
CHRIS HELLMANN: Yeah.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:59.870
PETRO SOININEN: Quite
a complex issue.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.190
CHRIS HELLMANN: You can't ask
for gender in Germany, for

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.470
example, these kinds
of things.

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.730
Yeah.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:07.630
DIANA CHENG: When it should
arise is also what happens

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.450
when the application changes.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.690
When the application gets
changed, if it needs a higher

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.180
level or a more specific
level of granularity.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.320
For example, for your location,
we thought OK,

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.560
asking for the exact location
all the time when only the

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.390
city is relevant.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.770
It's too much.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.480
Why shouldn't we ask for just
city, country, whatever?

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:32.740
Then what happens when the
app actually needs more

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.380
information?

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.660
They need to prompt
the user again.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:43.010
Or for a different action in the
same app, 15 minutes later

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.040
then you are prompting the user
again for a more specific

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.890
permission and that's
not good.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:48.960
CHRIS HELLMANN: It's
tricky, isn't it?

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.050
It all [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.170
to me it seems like we're not
going to solve this one here,

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:56.440
but I love the idea of any app
having access to a permissions

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.510
controller that actually would
control all the permissions

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.830
possible and actually allow you
to unset, set them, get

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.060
new permissions in, and
basically separate that from

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.100
your main app.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.350
Because right now, we have to
bake it in somehow and that

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:11.250
just feels like it
doesn't scale and

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.670
it's not future proof.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:16.370
Has anybody thought of that?

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.140
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah and it's also
really closely tied to a

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.170
capability model.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.050
So this is another problem that
we're running into pretty

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:26.715
often where we'll have devices
that don't have a camera and

00:41:26.715 --> 00:41:30.600
someone will ship an app in an
app store and that app will

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.170
utilize camera functionality.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.640
And right now our answer
is that we just fail.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.820
CHRIS HELLMANN: Trying to detect
a camera that isn't

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.140
there unless you ship
it with the app.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.016
BRIAN LEROUX: Right.

00:41:42.016 --> 00:41:43.330
Yeah.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.900
Buy this app, get
a free camera.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.350
AUDIENCE: Just an observation
about granularity

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.030
permissions, really.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.140
It seems that there's no
value in asking a user

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.855
can I use index TB?

00:41:54.855 --> 00:41:56.250
Can I use local storage?

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:58.660
Can I use app cache?

00:41:58.660 --> 00:41:59.820
Because they don't care.

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:03.060
But then something we thought
about in Opera was with like

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.290
geolocation.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.360
So we could imagine, for
example, that somebody like a

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.080
woman living on her own might
wish to say yeah my tweets can

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.380
have my location between 10:00
AM and 6:00 PM but I don't

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.965
want my tweets to have my
location after 6:00 PM because

00:42:17.965 --> 00:42:19.330
I'm probably at my house.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.473
CHRIS HELLMANN: So Geo-Fencing
that Flickr has?

00:42:21.473 --> 00:42:21.866
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:21.866 --> 00:42:22.260
Yeah.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:26.700
And one of the things that we
looked at as well about a

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.220
console where you
can look at the

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.960
permissions you've granted.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.730
You very rarely want to see what
permissions did I give to

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:39.150
Mr. Spanky dot DE,
for example.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.280
But you might very well--

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.240
sorry, Brian--

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.990
you might very well want
to say what things

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.950
can look at my camera?

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:52.180
So the question of which way
around the grid goes.

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.210
You probably care.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.940
Oh, shit!

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.200
What can look at my camera much
more than what have I

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.510
given every individual URL
or app, for example.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.690
And there's also with a camera,
of course, there's an

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.560
argument for having a big
kill switch so nothing

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.740
can look at my camera.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.910
Because obviously you cover the
camera on your phone or

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.200
your laptop, but there's no
guarantee that it isn't

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.815
actually a camera that's out of
reach that's plugged into

00:43:15.815 --> 00:43:19.612
your laptop and you might want
to have a kill thing.

00:43:19.612 --> 00:43:21.310
PAUL KINLAN: So one of the
interesting things about that

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.880
is I don't know whether we're
assuming that these

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.050
applications run inside the
browser, but a lot of the

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:28.820
stuff that especially we're
doing with Chrome applications

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.770
is that you don't know they're
actually even slightly tied to

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.180
Chrome in the slightest.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.280
So if you're going to have a
permissions model, you're not

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.440
going to put it inside your
browser for someone to go in

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.370
there and disable it.

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:42.270
And I don't know what type of
operating system level.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.530
We don't control
Windows, right?

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.750
So we couldn't put that in.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.690
So we have to go and add a
settings app, for instance, if

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:51.125
we're going to do that type
of thing it's hard.

00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:52.590
Yeah, just hard.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:54.380
CHRIS HELLMANN: Which brings
us to this one here.

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.020
What do packaged apps with their
close ties to particular

00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.670
browsers and web app stores mean
for cross browser as a

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.460
platform support?

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.030
As I said before, it's like we
always say in HTML5 you write

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.940
it once and it works everywhere
and then like

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:09.690
actually that app store doesn't
allow you to do that,

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.370
that one doesn't allow
you to do that.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:13.930
So can't we all just
get along?

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.970
When PhoneGap came out,
it said clearly

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.180
this is a gap solution.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.770
We want to be redundant sooner
or later and it's been now

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.420
four years?

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.670
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:26.730
Yep.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.960
PAUL KINLAN: But what's
it mean for

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.180
across browser support?

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.090
That's the question I've got.

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:34.230
If you've package this thing
up to be a deliverable--

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.050
it's like Adobe AIR, right?

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.800
When you could package a
[INAUDIBLE] on JavaScript it

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.830
would run with a really
old version of WebKit.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.640
Does the user know?

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.210
Does the user care?

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.420
Would they know it's Firefox and
not Firefox that's ruling

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.130
the renderer?

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.910
If you've got installable apps,
there are installable

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.430
apps which are technically
isolated from the browser.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.780
I don't know.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.520
And if you talk about things
inside the browser, then

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.410
that's a different
question again.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.610
BRIAN LEROUX: I think with
renderer things have gotten

00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.270
pretty clean at this point
because of one of the, I

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.320
think, biggest triumphs of HTML5
was defining the parser.

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.430
So now all browsers have the
same bugs and we don't need to

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.800
worry about cross browser
compatibility.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.960
This is just the new
part that's going

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.820
to be tough to do.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.110
And there's probably going to be
a jQuery of device APIs at

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:16.670
some point I would assume.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.530
And we're going to have
something that's going to

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.285
polyfill all this garbage
and then eventually

00:45:20.285 --> 00:45:21.650
standardize that too.

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.980
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.130
People are doing it
with Node, right?

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.760
So people are building these
Node-based servers which can

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.400
talk to AR drones and then go
well I want that to work on,

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.050
like a Chrome app.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.800
I want it to work on
the Firefox app.

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.600
Well, we'll just port the Node
APIs back across rather than

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.370
go and try and learn
the default--

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.180
BRIAN LEROUX: Browser find.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:37.650
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:42.010
Actually, we use browser find
in our project so it's cool.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.130
CHRIS HELLMANN: One question
we also had is why can't I

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:49.640
trust Open Full Screen without
the user having to give me

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.710
permission and the keyboard
access in Full Screen and all

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:53.650
the things we had?

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.270
That also ties into why can't I
have a video playing in the

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.580
background on iOS?

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.465
Why it is click to activate?

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:05.470
Education-wise, we probably know
why all of these things

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:06.200
are necessary.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.620
But it is a valid question
for end users.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.270
Why do I get this ugly window
saying this app is now full

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.480
screen because yeah, it's an
app, I want it full screen.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:17.680
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.150
It's all based on usage and
use cases and developers

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.290
actually wanting these
things, right?

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.260
And we didn't prioritize
that originally.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.790
We've added it in so that you
can request a window goes full

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.250
screen without any kind
of interstitial.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.290
But it's an installed app.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:30.590
It's a different thing.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.770
And I don't know whether the
access model from the web

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.680
translates to installed apps the
same way, where we have to

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:42.370
have an explicit user gesture
for activities such as across

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:43.180
a site and it just going

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.235
automatically to a full screen.

00:46:44.235 --> 00:46:45.540
You don't want that on
the drive by web.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.490
But as an installed app,
you're probably fine.

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:50.970
You want your game
full screen.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:51.141
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:52.640
It's to avoid fishing.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.680
Essentially because that screen
app could then fake

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:56.173
your Chrome.

00:46:56.173 --> 00:47:00.490
It could say, hey, you forget
to put in your bank path.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:01.810
CHRIS HELLMANN: I think the
best I've ever seen was a

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.080
banner that said has your credit
card being stolen?

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.180
Please enter your credit
card details here.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.550
That was amazing.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.750
I totally loved that.

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:15.320
So what do you think about
a model that allows you a

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.500
certain amount, like you can
store five photos without

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.280
asking for permission.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:25.440
Is that a possibility that we
have tried to buy permissions

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.250
and then when they like it, it
seems like you want to store

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.320
bigger photos.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.860
Please give us access to the
rest of the hardware.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:34.810
BRIAN LEROUX: Super
case by case.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.460
But yeah, I like it.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.470
I think it's good.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.490
And this is, for me, also one
of the fundamental issues is

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:41.980
offline storage.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.650
Right now we've got 2 to 5
megs depending on who you

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:47.920
believe which isn't enough
space to do anything

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.710
significant.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:52.030
And so yeah, I think we do
need these piecemeal

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.370
permissions to ease people
into the hot tub of it.

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.700
Right?

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.930
We got to get the
stuff into the

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.700
browser as soon as possible.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.680
CHRIS HELLMANN: How
about storage?

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:03.270
I mean, I don't want to go into
index DB versus web SQL.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:05.105
I'd tell people to
use Lawnchair.

00:48:05.105 --> 00:48:11.410
But it's still an issue that
people don't go into web app

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.320
development because they
basically say, I don't want to

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.470
write for 10 different things.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.920
Why can't your browser
vendors get along?

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.200
So what could be an
answer to that?

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:20.870
Use Lawnchair.

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:22.120
Yeah, I know.

00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:26.150
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.640
Use Lawnchair-- no, I don't know
what the answer is there.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.786
I think the browser vendors now
work together more than

00:48:29.786 --> 00:48:30.770
they ever have.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:33.470
The new browser war is
essentially consensus.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.520
That's the new battle that's
happening and it's

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.020
speed and dev tools.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.330
Those are the things that the
browsers are fighting about.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.820
So we're winning as devs but
there's just all these things

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.130
and storage is one of
them that the native

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.070
world kicks our ass.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.320
We need to fix that.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:53.090
CHRIS HELLMANN: OK.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:53.790
Any last words?

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:55.040
We're almost out of time.

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.240
Give us a timeline.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.390
When can we finally have
packaged apps that work

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:01.360
everywhere?

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.400
When can you close PhoneGap?

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.360
BRIAN LEROUX: I have
no idea, man.

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:04.590
I don't know.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.490
I thought we'd be done
all this by now.

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.130
CHRIS HELLMANN: Do you get a
lot of stuff in Adobe that

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.730
people from AIR look at you
like we've done this.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.520
Why do you have to reinvent
it right now?

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:14.890
BRIAN LEROUX: Actually, no.

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:16.980
They're awesome.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.040
You could say that the road was
paved pretty easy and we

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.240
have a good roadmap to
look forward to.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.180
Stuff that had been done
in the Flash Player and

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.860
with AIR for sure.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.280
Yeah, they're cool.

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.050
CHRIS HELLMANN: Good.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.630
What do you think will be
the next thing for you

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.340
like Chrome app store?

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.550
Will there be Chrome packaged
apps for mobile as well?

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:39.970
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:41.070
If you look on GitHub,
there's a public

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.750
repo and it uses Cordova.

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.980
It's our easiest avenue to get
a consistent API stuck across

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:49.450
those devices.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.180
The biggest thing for me is like
the API access whether

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.030
it's cross browser or not.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.700
It's like the developer doesn't,
in theory, want to

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.200
have to care.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.410
We're supposed to be trying to
solve that problem for them

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:00.470
with HTML in general.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.300
But we are at the stage where
everything is brand new and

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.890
we've not really done this
device access thing before,

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:07.260
and we're all trying out
slightly different things.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.100
And at some point, we'll get
consensus and we'll have a

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.590
nice model.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.490
But we need to prove that
built-in native apps is a

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.410
thing that actually is going to
be cool and works, and we

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:18.985
deliver great user experiences
with it.

00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:21.700
CHRIS HELLMANN: Do you see a
slight competition between

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.310
apps and asking for permissions
and browsers

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:27.170
having things like WebRTC
and things inside?

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:30.410
A lot of people come to me and
saw something on HTML Rocks

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:31.700
like look in the latest
[? cannery ?]

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.380
I can also take pictures so why
do you even complain about

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.630
this anymore?

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.400
It's like desktop browsers seem
to have some things that

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.280
mobile browsers just
cannot get.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.700
And as developers, we try to
show off to each other but

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.990
don't understand
the difference.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:49.680
BRIAN LEROUX: I wasn't
even aware.

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.990
Is WebRTC really there?

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.130
I mean, I know Firefox
and Chrome are

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.363
talking to each other.

00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:54.736
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:54.736 --> 00:50:57.060
It's coming to--

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.270
BRIAN LEROUX: There's
that other browser.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:02.080
I'm trying to remember,
Internet Explorer.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.330
CHRIS HELLMANN: Or the
Erickson thing.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:04.710
Yeah.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:08.006
DIANA CHENG: I tried WebRTC
on Opera mobile.

00:51:08.006 --> 00:51:11.630
So [INAUDIBLE] media and it
prompts for permission but it

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.520
didn't really work.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.360
It didn't really show
me my stream.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.560
So I don't know why.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:20.310
Maybe it's implementing a
previous version of the spec

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.370
and I'm just asking it.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.170
BRIAN LEROUX: In many ways, all
this is not [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:29.160
like the world of technology and
the web is advancing to a

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.140
point where it is kind of all
hybrid and the differences

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.200
between the native stack and
the web stack are getting

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:36.890
blurrier by the second.

00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:39.890
I think that it's not going to
be like web versus native,

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.110
it's just going to
be development.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.680
Software development
will be of the web.

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.480
CHRIS HELLMANN: Web GL is a
good point there as well.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.460
It gives you like full access to
the graphics hardware which

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.210
you cannot do from anything else
which CSS shaders will

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:54.660
have the same thing, which
another company it has a

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.410
different 3D engine basically
said it's a security problem.

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:02.490
So we're not quite there yet
but we have a lot of

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.690
technologies that try to do the
same thing but we don't

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.540
seem to be there to
come up with a

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:09.180
standard around that stuff.

00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:12.380
So where do you think
we should go next?

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.900
Where do you think people
should push us

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.600
to actually do things?

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.910
I like people complaining and
filing bugs to browsers.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.880
I think they should much, much
more, but they should have a

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:25.140
good ammunition to say this is
the first thing we need.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.030
PAUL KINLAN: I think they've
been saying that

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.570
for a while, right?

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.910
They want offline
apps to work.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.870
If it's an app, for instance,
they want that to work pretty

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.420
much wherever they are
regardless of connection

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.260
status and they want
it installed.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.440
They don't want to have to
launch a browser to go and

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.060
launch an app to go and do
something that they would

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.950
expect to just find on their
desktop and click and open.

00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:46.700
I think if we get those two
sorted, we're on a good path

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.210
to working the rest out.

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:51.260
And then it's use case
lead from there.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.240
BRIAN LEROUX: Yeah, I agree.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.286
Totally.

00:52:53.286 --> 00:52:54.600
Those are the biggest

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.370
challenges for sure is offline.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.632
Discovery may be another one
too, figuring out this app

00:52:59.632 --> 00:53:00.690
store thing.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:00.820
CHRIS HELLMANN: Yeah.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.860
Because we need a search engine
for app stores by now.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.990
There's far too many
out there already.

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:08.020
It's tricky to actually--

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:10.510
when promoting your app means to
have to go through like 40

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.560
different app stores, then
something went very wrong

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.970
along the way because we had
the internet already to put

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.360
your content out there and get
it found by people like Google

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.520
and others.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.380
Well thanks very much.
