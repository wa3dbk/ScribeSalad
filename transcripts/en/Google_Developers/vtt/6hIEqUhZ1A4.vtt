00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.280
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.610
from Moscone Center here
in San Francisco.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.260
We're here to talk
about Blink.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.090
I'm Louis Gray, and
I'm joined by Alex

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.120
Komoroske and Paul Irish.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.830
Welcome, gentlemen.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.140
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.565
PAUL IRISH: Absolutely.

00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:22.990
ALEX KOMOROSKE: No problem.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.245
LOUIS GRAY: Real quickly, we
want to talk about Blink, a

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:26.730
brand new rendering engine.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.830
I want to get you guys' take
on what's been introduced.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Blink is
a new rendering engine.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930
It's based originally
off WebKit.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.170
It's a rendering engine that's
open source, and it's using

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.820
Chromium and Chrome.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.090
LOUIS GRAY: So you
said open source.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.310
Is it a Google product?

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.250
Open source?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.460
Help us out.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.340
PAUL IRISH: I mean, it's
operated within kind of the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.110
Chromium open-source
community.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.510
So there's Chromium, which is
kind of the open-source

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.480
implementation of
Google Chrome.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.840
And they're basically 99% the
same, with a few very small

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.175
differences.

00:01:00.175 --> 00:01:07.880
But Blink is an open-source
project, and we expect it to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.315
be used in Opera's
products as well.

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:10.650
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.010
So it's open source, and one
of our main goals for the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.980
project is to be as

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.850
transparent, as open as possible.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.050
So we're trying to
have as much of a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.090
discussion in public channels.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.270
We've already seen a lot of
really good engagement from

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.900
people from other companies,
from other organizations, and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.740
web developers on these threads,
sort of providing

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.510
their feedback about features
we're thinking about

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.280
implementing.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.630
It's been really great.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.945
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:33.050
So how does a new
rendering engine

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.490
benefit consumers anyway?

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.140
Is it going to get faster?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.810
What's going to happen?

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.135
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So as
it starts out, it's

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.080
based off of WebKit.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.630
So basically, as of a
month ago, it was

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.870
almost exactly the same.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.100
Since then, we've been
optimizing some pieces on our

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.350
side, and it will continue
to get faster.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.670
And over time, however, a
stronger, faster rendering

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.630
engine allows you to
do new things.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.350
So it allows developers to
build better experiences.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.850
It allows them to be faster so
consumers' webpages will just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.290
appear faster and
do more things.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.080
PAUL IRISH: One of the main
things that we focus a lot on

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.670
is speed, right?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.889
And so when I'm scrolling a page
on my phone, I want it to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.140
stick my finger,
and I want that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.150
experience to be fantastic.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.310
And with Blink, we have the
opportunity to make some

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.080
really radical changes to the
infrastructure of how a

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.870
browser's put together to really
deliver a fast and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.330
awesome user experience.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.390
LOUIS GRAY: One thing that's
really interesting.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.240
You look at the web-- and it
was talked about today in

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.850
today's keynote--

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.470
we're on the 20th anniversary
of the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.740
introduction of the web.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.330
And one of the things that's
really helped the web grow and

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.720
just work on practically every
device is standards.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.980
And so with an introduction of
a new rendering engine, is

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.700
this situation where web
developers and app developers

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.810
who code for the web are going
to have to make two versions

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.990
of their product?

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.450
What does that mean for
a developer's side?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.530
PAUL IRISH: There's no
big real changes.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.410
Blink is dedicated to
just supporting an

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.530
interoperable web.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.400
And that's something that we
believe a lot, and it's having

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.480
a compatible, interoperable
web.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.470
So for developers building
for the web, you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.490
build to web standards.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.430
You build just as you did, and
you can expect it to work.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.220
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And I think
back many, many years ago,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.940
different browsers were
very different.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.040
I think in the past few years,
the different rendering

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.840
engines have gotten
closer and closer.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.370
PAUL IRISH: A lot closer.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: A lot closer as
everyone really is taking

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.910
standards very seriously.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.710
We're also very excited to
invest more in testing, so

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.590
helping write tests with
standards organizations and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.170
other browser vendors
that all the browser

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.245
rendering engines can run.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.310
And that helps verify that
these things are

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.130
interoperable.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.780
And so the developers don't
have to write totally

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.100
different versions for
different browsers.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.740
PAUL IRISH: In the past,
developers have known about

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.895
browser quirks and
things like that.

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:46.240
And over the past two years,
there have been less and less,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.810
because browsers are running
the exact same tests, even

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.010
though they're different
products.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.130
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.150
So this is the situation.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.930
You used to have
modern browsers

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.590
and non-modern browsers.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.020
Is Blink a cut above?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.110
Is it going to be the
most modern browser?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.320
PAUL IRISH: It certainly moves
fast, and it gets new features

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.670
all the time.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.120
But you're going to get a
consistent experience when

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.520
you're coding to the
new features.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: The goal is
to build the best possible

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.840
rendering engine we can.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.390
But what's great about the open
web is you have all these

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.620
different compatible rendering
engines, and so this is very

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.540
healthy competition
to spur innovation

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.120
throughout the ecosystem.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.814
LOUIS GRAY: One thing we
talked about before.

00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:25.050
Since Blink is still fairly
new, and we're talking a

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.380
little bit about the new
features that are

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.105
going to come out.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:29.740
We expect the community to
respond really strongly.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.580
One of the questions I have
around browsing is we have so

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.660
many people who are browsing on
mobile these days, relative

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.700
to the desktop.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.610
How much did the advancement
of mobile usage of browsing

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.310
impact the decision to
look toward Blink?

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.150
And do you think that mobile
users can see the benefits of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.780
Blink as quickly as desktop?

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.520
ALEX KOMOROSKE: If you saw the
keynote this morning, Linus

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.970
talked a lot about how the
future of the web is mobile,

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.730
and so we take this really
serious on the Chrome team.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.880
Now, the reason that we started
Blink actually came

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.080
down to the fact that Chromium's
multiprocess

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800
architecture is just different
than the other WebKit-based

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.105
browsers, and it led to
complexity in the code base.

00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:06.860
And that was primarily the thing
that drove us to make

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.370
this decision.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.595
But yes, we care very deeply
about mobile, and we're

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.060
excited about the different
kinds of things we can

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.750
experiment with.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.500
LOUIS GRAY: And when
you look at the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.730
complexity in the code base--

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.490
I remember when we launched,
and we had our initial blog

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.200
posts and the reactions
to it--

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.860
a lot of discussion was taken
to kind of getting away some

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.070
of the cruft or older code that
was available in WebKit.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.520
How does that benefit
folks as well?

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.380
Is it just easier to
develop on it with

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.250
fewer lines of code?

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.290
I mean, what are we
getting away from?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.092
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I want to point
out, actually, that

00:05:29.092 --> 00:05:30.920
WebKit is an amazing
code base, and

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.540
it's an amazing community.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.690
And what we were trying to
remove were pieces that just

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.110
weren't relevant to Chromium.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.760
And so when you have extra stuff
in a code base that you

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.610
aren't using, that's
code that has more

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.730
surface area for bugs.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.265
It takes longer to check
out as a developer.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:45.830
It takes longer to
buil build even.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.850
And so it was removing pieces
that didn't apply to Chromium

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.560
but were still very nice
pieces of code, like

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.740
JavaScriptCore, for example.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.240
LOUIS GRAY: And you've mentioned
code and cruft.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.570
One of the fun things I've seen
bump up in coverage of

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.890
Blink is vendor prefixes.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.820
For those of us online who
don't know what a vendor

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.490
prefix is, what is it, Paul?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.180
And why do I care about
a vendor prefix?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.390
PAUL IRISH: Sure.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.020
The idea behind vendor
prefix is a way to

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.680
kind of insulate users.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.660
When browsers want to introduce
kind of a new,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.600
experimental feature and they
want to be able to have a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.810
little bit of freedom to maybe
change it in the future.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.460
And then, browser vendors will
kind of work together,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.100
standardize it.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.825
And then, the prefix that's in
front of it will disappear.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:25.470
It will graduate.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.100
Now, that was kind of
the idea behind it,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.275
and that sounds good.

00:06:28.275 --> 00:06:31.020
But in practice over the past
few years, it's kind of not

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.110
worked out, and it's had
some kind of harmful

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.740
effects on the ecosystem.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.980
So one of the things with the
introduction of Blink was that

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.290
we were able to take a policy
and said that we're not going

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.220
to be introducing any
new vendor prefixes.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.840
It's painful as a developer to
deal with having multiple

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.090
vendor prefixes, and we're not
going to add any new ones, and

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.760
we're not going to introduce new
features that have this.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.080
And this is a similar model to
what Mozilla with Firefox has

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.640
gone towards.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.205
And also, the W3C CSS Working
Group has kind of said that

00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:03.341
this is the direction that makes
sense going forward.

00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:05.630
LOUIS GRAY: Now, Blink
is still fairly new.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.590
I know a lot of people, often
when something comes out,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.790
right away they say, how can
I get my hands on it?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.340
And because Blink is an engine
and not an app, it's not like

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.630
you can just download Blink
and start playing.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.520
So if you want to get your
hands on it, either as a

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.200
developer or as a user, what's
the best way to do that?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.770
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So again, from
the very beginning, it was

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.050
literally just WebKit.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.650
And then, we've been developing
in a slightly

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.710
different direction.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.820
And so all the newest versions
ever since April 4th, I think,

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.360
when we announced Blink, have
been using "Blink."

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.420
It's just that it's not really
that different yet.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.050
It's getting more and
more different.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.360
And so those versions will
become on the stable channel

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.793
of Chrome in a number
of weeks.

00:07:39.793 --> 00:07:43.220
PAUL IRISH: The Chrome Beta has
Blink in it, and Canary

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:43.735
has Blink in it.

00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:46.540
So if you want to try
it out, but--

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.440
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's not going
to feel very different.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.430
PAUL IRISH: No.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.590
LOUIS GRAY: And as a Chrome OS
user, do I get access to Blink

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.220
as well, or is that
a separate branch?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.545
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:52.870
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.690
LOUIS GRAY: So I'm using
my Pixel here.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.750
I use Pixel practically every
single day, as often as I can.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.420
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I love mine.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.020
LOUIS GRAY: And so one of the
things that's been really cool

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:00.760
for me for the Pixel--

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.660
I know we have a conversation
about that tomorrow--

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.420
is you're finding more and more
web apps are replacing

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.110
the things that I traditionally
had to use a

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.320
desktop for.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.795
Is that part of also our
consideration, as we build a

00:08:12.795 --> 00:08:15.420
new rendering engine, to enable
what's next in the

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:15.810
world of web apps?

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:16.390
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.860
We believe very firmly that the
web platform deserves to

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.080
be as powerful as any other
native platform.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.680
And so we've been pushing within
the ecosystem, within

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.575
the standards bodies, and really
supporting that drive

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.512
to make the web platform as
powerful as possible.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:32.924
LOUIS GRAY: That's awesome.

00:08:32.924 --> 00:08:35.260
Well, Paul and Alex, I
appreciate you guys coming

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.549
down today.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.590
I know you have a very busy
Google I/O. Really one of the

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.559
hottest topics that's out there
for the web and for

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:41.720
Google in general.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.669
For those you on the livestream,
stay tuned.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.990
We have four more sessions
coming your way, whether

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.960
you're on the Android Channel,
Chrome Channel, or the

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.940
technical ones as well.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.230
And we'll be back right after
those with more programming at

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.800
Google Developers Live at I/O.
