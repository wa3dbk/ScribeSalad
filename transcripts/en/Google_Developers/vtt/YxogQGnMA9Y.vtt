VIJAY MENON: Thanks
for coming.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
We're talking about Putting the
App Back Into Web App--

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.150
Web Programming With Dart.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.880
How many of you just attended
the last talk by Lars and

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.895
Kasper on Dart?

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:27.390
Great.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.570
I think that was most of you.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.440
If you haven't, you should
be able to pick it up.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.080
Dart's a very familiar
language.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.690
We're excited about the Dart
programming language for its

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.760
potential for creating web apps,
particularly apps code

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.035
that runs in the browser.

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:40.110
I'm Vijay Menon.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.520
DAN GROVE: And I'm Dan Grove.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.310
We're here from Google's
Seattle Team.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.490
So how many of you have
used web apps before?

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.108
It looks something like this.

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:53.596
All right.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.012
How many of you are
happy with this?

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:57.500
Beautiful.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.460
I had to ask.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.670
VIJAY MENON: This talk
is not for you.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.852
Sorry.

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:06.310
DAN GROVE: When I got to Google
back in late 2007,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.262
there was a lot of talk about
developing [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:12.050
But they're really ugly.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.375
But that's OK because they
all [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:15.770
AUDIENCE: Your mic's
not working.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.202
VIJAY MENON: Oh, your
mic is off.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:20.034
DAN GROVE: It says it's on.

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:20.978
I'll try it again.

00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:22.394
Let's see.

00:01:22.394 --> 00:01:23.935
VIJAY MENON: You got it?

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:25.420
DAN GROVE: It's not working.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.410
How about now?

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.660
No?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.570
VIJAY MENON: Why don't I take
over for a little bit while we

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.070
get Dan miced up properly.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.120
So yeah, now it's 2012, and our
expectations have changed.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.760
And one big thing that's changed
in the past five

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.880
years-- you've seen it here at
Google I/O. We have these

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
things now like tablets
and mobile devices.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.790
And that's really changed
our expectations of

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.540
what a nice app is.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.040
And this is an app that we wrote
to specifically run well

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.200
on a tablet.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.940
And we had quite a few
aims with this.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.000
One is that we wanted to
make it beautiful.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
And to do that, we really wanted
precise control over

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.620
how the app looked on the screen
and on a variety of

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.120
different form factors.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.220
We wanted it to be very nice to
interact with, particularly

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.000
with the latest and
greatest devices.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.800
Touch.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.300
We wanted rich animation.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.930
So we want the illusion
of infinite scroll.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.470
We want 60 frames per
second interaction.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.800
We just want this thing to be
able to respond to us very

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.330
quickly in, again, a variety
of form factors.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.320
So what we were interested in
figuring out is whether we

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.780
could build this sort of
an app in the browser.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.630
So basically our experiences
were validated.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:56.130
And this is the same exact app
running on Chrome with pretty

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.900
much the same sort of interface
capabilities and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.270
interactivity with it.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.520
DAN GROVE: Yeah, so users
really wanted to have

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.810
something that was a lot better
than what we were

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.320
giving them back in 2007.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.120
And when we designed Swarm, we
really wanted to make this

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.670
thing beautiful.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.110
And we think that the mobile
space really has driven the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.690
beauty requirements
for apps quite a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.980
long way at this point.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.580
We also wanted the app
to be really fast.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.450
We wanted it to start
up instantly.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.810
And we also wanted
it to be super

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.800
responsive to user actions.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.090
And there are a bunch of
good reasons for that.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.120
One of them is how many of you
guys have had Wi-Fi problems

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.670
here today?

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.700
Anyone?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.030
So that sucks, right?

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.900
You're trying to use
your application.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.960
You're waiting for the
web to respond.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.700
It's terrible.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.250
We were told this morning that
no Wi-Fi was working at all

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.720
for speaker talks.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.950
And so we were happy that our
app actually works offline.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.600
So that was great.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.060
We really wanted an app
that works offline.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.970
But we also wanted one that
would leverage the cloud when

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.110
the cloud was available.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.800
VIJAY MENON: Yeah,
Lars and Kasper

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.510
talked about this theme.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.820
It's been hit a few times.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.860
One of the reasons we did it,
the news app as our test

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.970
application in Dart, well
one, we're news junkies.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.440
And we knew it was an app we'd
use, which is always good.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.100
But the other is that, that
was a fairly common

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.860
experience.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.390
With the web, you don't
have to install.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.300
Probably, most of you've
gotten this experience,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.350
particularly on a mobile device,
where you get a link

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.950
to a news story, you click on
it, and then you get this

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.440
message that says, please
install this app for

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.430
such-and-such newspaper you've
never heard of to get the best

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.760
viewing experience.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.450
And there's many cases
where it makes

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.400
sense to install apps.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.520
But that's one where at
least we think it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.310
made no sense at all.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.420
We just want the system to get
out of our way and be able to

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.670
just get to our content in
the browser on the web.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.660
DAN GROVE: Yeah, so we wanted
to build a web application

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.360
that was really first
class in every way.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.100
The good thing was that the web
had actually changed a ton

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.350
in the last five years.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.680
So one thing that's happened is
that web capabilities have

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.260
improved radically.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.160
So you've gotten things
like animation

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.780
and Canvas and WebGL.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.420
I'll tell you a story.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.570
I was incredibly disappointed
when I first arrived at Google

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.660
back coming up on
five years ago.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.340
Because I thought, the web can
do all this cool stuff.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.640
There's all this great stuff.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.630
And I went out, and I met with
a bunch of teams to find out

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.130
what they're doing.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.260
They said, well Web 2.0, it's
string concatenation,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.620
essentially.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.610
That was basically it.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.880
There was nothing more
to it than that.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.230
And we've moved way past that.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.830
You can actually do these kinds
of cool animations and

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.870
3D graphics on the web,
which is fantastic.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.350
We've also gotten rid of
a lot of plug-ins.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.970
So you can actually build audio
that competes with the

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.520
best native audio.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.840
You don't need plug-ins
for video.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.880
That's another fantastic
thing.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.850
And then there are really crazy
things that have been

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.300
developed, like sockets.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.156
You could actually have a socket
between the client and

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:40.620
the server.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.580
I mean, it's 2012.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.420
It's about time, but you
can actually do it.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.920
One nice thing I'd point out
here is that this is code for

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.080
creating a web socket in Dart,
and it's actually very pretty.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.160
It's actually typed.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.750
It's very easy to
reason about it.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.450
It has nice closures.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.810
When I first put up the
code for this--

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.400
I actually put up the
JavaScript code for

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.060
WebSockets--

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.430
and frankly, it was a lot uglier
than the Dart code.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.980
So we'll be talking a
lot more about this.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.430
But I think it's really
fantastic.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.500
And there are a lot of other
really cool features that are

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.140
coming on the web.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.150
And there are more coming
all the time.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.170
There are all kinds of talks
here about doing new P2P

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.630
real-time video and audio and
all kinds of other neat stuff.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.260
VIJAY MENON: The other axis, big
axis, that's changed over

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.940
time is JavaScript
performance.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.250
And this is a really
interesting graph.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.630
Because for a very, very long
period of time, up to 2007,

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.740
performance of code running
in the browser

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.250
didn't really change.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.210
And then in 2008, something
happened.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.700
One of those things, at least,
was that Chrome was released

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.670
with V8, its JavaScript
engine.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.560
And performance suddenly
got a lot better.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.190
And then over the past five
years, it's really gotten

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.010
much, much better, not
just on Chrome but on

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.520
other browsers as well.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.080
In fact, even your mobile
devices today run JavaScript

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.690
far faster than what a desktop
did five years ago.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.250
And what's interesting about
this is that a lot of the apps

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.290
that we interact with were
designed in this old world,

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.650
where you really had no ability
to do any interesting

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.430
compute on the browser itself.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.170
It was just way too slow.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.750
And this is going to be kind of
a running theme here that

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.550
we'll get to later, that we
can rethink apps today.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.690
This is not Moore's Law.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:23.000
This is Moore's Law on steroids
if you look at the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.570
gains that we've seen
in performance

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.030
in just five years.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.250
And that lets us dramatically
rethink how we design apps.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.510
DAN GROVE: Right.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.530
So the bottom line here is that
the browser has really

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.880
changed across two axes.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.110
It's gotten far more
capabilities, and the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.470
performance has increased so
much that we can start doing

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.590
things radically differently
from the way we were doing

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.570
them in the past.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.910
So we talked about the web.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.060
But why are we here talking
about Dart?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.540
Well, programs don't just
get better magically.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.390
They get better because
programmers develop them.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.830
And developing these better
apps often requires bigger

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.800
apps that are made out
of building blocks.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.760
And that requires actually
programming at scale.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.900
And when we talk about
programming in scale on Dart,

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.500
we're talking about things
like 100,000-line or a

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.720
million-line application.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.550
You're unlikely to build
that yourself.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.100
In fact, you're unlikely to
have two or three people

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.060
building that in
a small group.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.570
What you're likely to
have are actual

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.790
composable building blocks.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.250
You're going to need
to reuse code.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.420
And we're not talking about
copying and pasting code or

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.460
downloading a little
piece of JavaScript

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.240
and pasting it together.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.956
We're talking about something
where you actually want to be

00:08:29.956 --> 00:08:33.039
able to build libraries and
reuse those libraries.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.250
In order to do that, you
actually want structure.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.820
So structure is great, because
it actually lets you start

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.850
reasoning about your
application.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.750
All those things you learned
back in Computer Science 101

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.100
are actually very relevant
in Dart.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.580
You have classes, and you have
interface, and you have all

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.780
these nice things.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.230
You also want to have
static checking.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.030
So grep works great when you
have 1,000 lines of code or

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.410
something like that.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.800
Grep doesn't work great
when you have a

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.680
million lines of code.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.420
And at Google, we actually have
a number of people who

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.070
spend their time thinking about
tools to go and search

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.460
over your code and reason
about your code.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.390
Static checking and static
checkability of a language

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.600
really assist this.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.870
You also want it
to be toolable.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.800
vi or TextMate probably start
breaking down when your

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.590
application gets to
be 100,000 lines.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.120
You actually want to be able
to jump to definition.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.660
You want to be able to find out
if a type exists, or you

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.830
want to be able to find out
if a method exists.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.510
All these things are really
important, and one of the

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.990
things we'll be talking about
in this talk is the Dart

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.730
Editor and how it helps
you with these things.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.290
So we have a bunch of tools to
make Dart easier to program.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.840
And the first of these
is the Dart Editor.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.010
This is an Eclipse-based editor
that Kasper showed off

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:42.840
in the last talk.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.630
And it provides a lot of very
nice features, which Vijay

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.820
will be popping into
in a minute.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.590
We also have something
that we call Dartium.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.900
And Dartium is our own
home-brewed version of

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.730
Chromium with the Dart
VM embedded in it.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.985
And this is really fantastic
because it gives you that

00:09:56.985 --> 00:09:59.790
instant edit refresh cycle
that everyone likes.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.860
When it's time to actually
deploy your app, Kasper talked

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.690
at length about the Dart2JS
Compiler in the last talk.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.030
The goal here is that Dart
does not break the web.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.320
We compiled Dart to the tip of
all the major browsers that

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.590
are auto updated.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.260
And we also compile
it to run on IE9+.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.800
VIJAY MENON: So rather than
just tell you about this,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.730
let's dive in and show.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.850
And one of things we're going to
show later in this talk is

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.930
we're going to go into detail
on the Swarm newsreader.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.670
But before I dive into that,
let's start with something

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.290
really simple.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.370
Let's just go into the Dart
Editor here and create a new

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:34.850
application.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.060
Let's just create a "Hello
World!" application here.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.100
So it's a nice wizard to just
get me bootstrapped.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.700
But it's really quite
simple here.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.370
There's just--

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.240
If you look at what this
created, I have an HTML file.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.530
Let's go there first.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.890
That's, of course,
where you land.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.790
And it's HTML.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.460
The things I really want to call
out to you here are some

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.870
things that we've done to help
you debug your application on

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.940
Dartium and also deploy
it on any browser with

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.890
the same HTML file.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.630
So first you'll notice two
script tags at the bottom.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.110
The first one has a type you
may not have seen before,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.390
application slash dart.

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.600
That's a new type that is
intended for browsers that

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.300
support Dart natively.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.050
And in our case,
that's Dartium.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.910
And so Dartium will be able to
just run hello.dart directly

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.995
with no tools involved.

00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.410
You just change your
app, reload it in

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.210
Dartium, and it works.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.110
Of course, you want your app
to run on all browsers.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.280
And to make that easy, at least
for the development

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.110
perspective, we have this little
script called dart.js,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.400
which just bootstraps.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.330
It detects if you've got
Dart loaded or not--

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.960
or Dart supported
natively or not.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.780
And if you don't have Dart
supported natively, it will

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:51.420
replace it with a JS version
instead that you've generated.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.050
And of course, if you're
deploying this, you don't

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:56.400
necessarily want to do this
stuff, you could just deploy

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.880
directly with the JavaScript
that you generate

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.640
out of Dart to JS.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.390
So let's take a look
at hello.dart.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.390
We're importing a library.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.450
I'll get to that in a moment.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:14.535
The main entry point of any
Dart application is Main.

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:18.420
And it's calling a method called
showMessage here, which

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:24.120
is taking a string and doing an
operation on it to show the

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.620
message "Welcome to Dart"
on a web page.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.210
So let's just fire that up.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.090
This is running in Dartium.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.610
And you can see it's just
loaded up right here.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:34.730
So let's take a look at this.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:39.080
So first of all, dart:HTML is
the way you interact with the

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.560
browser at the lowest
level in Dart.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.670
And we had a few things that we
were trying to do when we

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.710
created this library.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.770
First, we wanted to basically
give you all the capabilities

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.800
that you have in JavaScript for
interacting with the DOM.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.140
So anything you can pretty much
do in JavaScript you can

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.510
do in Dart as well.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.900
But we also wanted to take
the opportunity to

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.370
clean up the API.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.410
A lot of times, people will use
frameworks, like jQuery,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:10.270
for example, just because the
raw DOM API is kind of clumsy

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.830
to use and shows its age.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.750
So we definitely took
inspiration from some of these

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.000
frameworks and tried to just
clean up the raw DOM.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.060
So just accessing the DOM
directly was nice.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.370
And then finally, this library
was really codesigned as the

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.970
Dart language itself evolved.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.670
And we tried to make the API
take advantage of all the

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.920
features of Dart.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.550
So for example, this query API
here is-- it's kind of

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.950
analogous to the dollar-sign
operation in jQuery if you're

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.230
used to that.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.010
It's basically a querySelector
on the DOM looking for an

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.160
element of ID text and
then setting its Text

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.650
field to the message.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.550
And the nice thing about this
is that it's typed.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.150
So let's take a look at this.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:03.610
So suppose we just want to
go to the declaration.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.860
We've got the tooling to
go ahead and do that.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.820
So we can just see, what
is this query method?

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.260
Well, we have this comment here
that tells us that it's

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.070
returns the first element in
some traversal of the document

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:14.810
given a string.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.290
What is an element?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.750
Well, we can do that too.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.640
Just chase that down, and we
see it's an interface.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.030
This ends up actually being one
of the basic interfaces in

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.410
the HTML DOM that we can
go ahead and work with.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:32.790
So a nice thing also about using
the Dart Editor is that

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.080
it's doing some analysis here.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.190
So it knows the type.

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.140
So remember, query returns
an element.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.780
And so you're able to use that
information and get auto

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:41.580
completion here.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.480
And we know what
the fields are.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.800
And so, as a programmer,
you can quickly search.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.230
You don't have to look
up documentation.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.940
You have at your fingertips
what you can do.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.760
Another nice thing is if
you do make typos,

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.770
the editor can tell.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.000
It'll look at the type
information, and show you that

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.110
you did something wrong.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.355
DAN GROVE: There's a red
line under there, for

00:15:05.355 --> 00:15:06.230
those in the back.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.050
VIJAY MENON: The yellow line or
problem, and if we look at

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.300
the list of problems
here, we see, hey,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.190
there's something wrong.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.730
Text is not a member
of element.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.260
If you were at the last talk,
one of the things that Kasper

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.800
talked about in terms of
JavaScript is that it had this

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.640
just trucking mentality.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.800
And this is a case where, if
you do this kind of code in

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.030
JavaScript and you misspell
the field, it will happily

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.630
just create a new property
called txt on your element.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.560
And it won't show up.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.010
And you'll just be wondering
what happened.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.480
And you'll have to dig
that out yourself.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.980
Here, we get that information
right away.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.920
And that's, again, the
philosophy of early error

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.360
information in Dart, which we
think is going to be very

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.880
important as we go
to larger apps.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.080
So let's show more about Dart
HTML before we move on.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.925
One of the fundamental things
you want to do with DOM is

00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:54.710
create elements.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.910
And we have a nice way
of doing that.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.020
In JavaScript you
need a factory.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.740
In Dart you just call
a constructor.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.960
So we can call new
CanvasElement

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.120
to create the Canvas.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.450
And the constructor for Canvas
takes height and width.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.800
It uses a feature called
Optional Named Parameters.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:19.820
So I don't have to remember
the order in which it's--

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.920
whether it's height or width.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.550
I can just go ahead
and invoke that.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:27.215
And this typo, at least,
was on purpose.

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:29.420
It shows that, hey,
I got it wrong.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.680
That was the wrong name
of the field.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.740
Every time I give this talk
I have different typos.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.910
So you can guess which ones--

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.460
They're all on purpose.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.840
It's all right.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.310
So yeah, I could tell right away
that there's a problem.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.620
And I can go ahead
and fix that.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.520
And again, I get cool type
completion from here.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.040
So again, I know what's
on the Canvas.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.840
I know that it's got a context,
a 2D context, in

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.450
particular.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.140
Usually want to get at the
context to be able to do

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.620
interesting things.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:08.372
And then if I want to set the
fill style in the context, not

00:17:08.372 --> 00:17:13.930
the Context 2D, again, I
can see what's there.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.180
Let's make this one red.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.216
Let's also fill a rectangle.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.130
Go with something very
simple here.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.340
But again, I see, as I'm typing
in, what the signature

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.370
of this method is.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:31.990
So I don't have to really guess
at what the parameters

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.820
are or have to look up
things on the side.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.370
It just sort of works for me.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.890
And let's go ahead and add this
to the document and see

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.870
how that looks.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.575
So I'm just going to get the
nodes of the document's body.

00:17:44.575 --> 00:17:47.310
And I'm going to go ahead
and add the Canvas.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.290
And let's load that
up in Dartium.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.340
And now you can see our "hello"
app with just a little

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.840
Canvas at the bottom.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.330
All right.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.600
So let's make this a little
bit more interesting.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.250
First of all let's just--

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.140
Because I don't type too fast,
let me just do some cut and

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.500
paste and create a second
Canvas here,

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.060
and save this off.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.810
And as I do this, one nice thing
I get is, hey there's

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.630
some errors.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.730
You can't just do it
the way you did.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.290
The editor shows me right away
that Canvas and context are

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.360
duplicate definitions.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.870
And in this case, I can look at
my code and know that these

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.200
two definitions don't conflict
with each other.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.520
And I can make sure that I'm
doing the right thing here.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.870
And let's make this one a little
bit different for fun.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.380
Give it a different width.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:42.230
Let's make it blue, and
just load it back up.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.740
And again, I'm just
reloading--

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.660
I'm restarting the browser,
because it's so fast.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.370
But you don't have to do that.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.140
I can just go change it here.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.220
I do have to save my file.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:56.000
But then I can just go
back into Dartium

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.720
here and reload it.

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.030
And everything just works.

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.140
So that's how you
create elements.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.110
You've got nice constructors
in Dart that you

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.210
can use to do it.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.700
You've got named optional
parameters to make it easy to

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.440
set things up.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.450
Let's say you want a query.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.320
That's a fundamental
operation.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.400
And we showed one example
right here where we're

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.230
querying for text, for the
element with the text ID.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:28.070
Let's do another one where we
get a list of all of the

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.800
Canvas objects.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.270
So Query All is another
operation like query, but this

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.150
returns a list.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.770
So now you get nice typing
information.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.480
List is a fundamental data
structure in Dart.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.250
And there's nice language
support for it.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:49.750
So I get this list, and it's
really easy to just iterate

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:51.950
over all the elements
in the list.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.840
So this will give me each
Canvas, and I can do something

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.620
interesting with it.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:02.010
So in this case, let's go ahead
and set the context.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.940
And note that this
is pretty cool.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.850
The editor is still able to
reason about this and do some

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.450
nice auto complete for me.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.660
So let's fill in another
rectangle, slightly different,

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.910
so we can actually
see something.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.300
So this should go through the
two Canvases on my page and

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.740
draw an existing rectangle.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.500
So let's see if I
did this right.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.500
And yes, you can see that
here is the second

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.390
rectangle on both.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.160
Iterating over properties,
this is kind of a

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.930
cool, subtle thing.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.950
You can write this code
in JavaScript and

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:37.840
iterate over the list.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.320
But it doesn't do exactly
what you want.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.750
It will not only give you the
Canvas objects, it will also

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.760
give you the length property
and so on.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.670
So it's not as nicely integrated
as it is in Dart.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.790
And that makes for a pretty
cool experience.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.570
One of the things we liked
a lot about jQuery is the

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.010
ability to chain things
together.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.190
And you can do that in pretty
cool ways in Dart, too.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:03.030
So let's do another operation
on the Canvas here.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.150
And again, this is going
to give me a

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.830
list of all the Canvases.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.790
And the list object in Dart has
a lot of nice functional

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:12.460
style methods.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:15.980
So one of the things we
can do is filter.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.020
And that takes a closure.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:22.540
So we can basically say, well
let's get all of the elements

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:27.650
where the width is
equal to 100.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:32.840
So that should give me
the second Canvas.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.640
A lot of times--

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.390
And again, I get the nice
auto complete as I go.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:43.350
A lot of times, again, when
you're working with a Canvas,

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.140
you really just want to
work with its context.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:50.780
So we can go ahead and pull
out the context 2D.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.860
So now instead of a list of
Canvas elements, we have a

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.020
list of Canvas rendering
context 2D.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.515
That's a bit of a mouthful, but
we haven't actually had to

00:21:59.515 --> 00:21:59.930
type that in.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.920
So it's not so bad.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:11.360
And then finally, once we have
that context that we want,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:16.110
let's go ahead and, since I'm
having so much fun with

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.330
rectangles, fill another
rectangle this time.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.465
And let's make this kind of
long, just so it shows up.

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.914
And I need to close that off.

00:22:33.914 --> 00:22:36.150
Oh, don't have a semicolon
there.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.980
It's awfully nice having an
editor that tells you what you

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:42.370
did wrong when you're giving
a live demo, by the way.

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.730
So yeah.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.040
I save that.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.790
Let me go ahead and
load that up.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.340
If I did this right, yes, you
see a difference only on the

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.070
second Canvas.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.410
So again, you've got this nice
way of just chaining things

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.640
together in Dart that you just
get for free, because we're

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.930
able to leverage the core
Dart data structures.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.100
And one final thing I want
to get to in dart:HTML.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.200
Fundamental thing with UIs, of
course, and web UIs, is you

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.080
want to be able to
add listeners.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.810
So you can do that.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.980
And that's another thing that
we've changed a bit.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.140
Let me just go ahead and use
this text element here.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.390
This is an element.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.230
We can listen to all of the
events on it by just looking

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.080
at this On field, which gives us
a list of all the things we

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:22.910
can listen on to.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.730
So we can easily see
what's there.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.160
And of course, one of the more
interesting ones is click.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.120
We can go ahead and add
our own handler that

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.150
listens to an event.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.470
And in this case, we're
not going to do

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.280
anything with that event.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.530
We're just going to show
a new message.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.030
And if I did this right,
I have the event here.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.400
OK.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.460
So that's all running
in Dartium.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.950
Of course, you're going to want
to be able to run your

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:00.810
stuff as JavaScript, and
that's easy to do.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.200
You can just generate
JavaScript here.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.570
And let's go there, grab that
same URL, go to another

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.260
browser, Firefox--

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.980
we haven't actually put
the Dart VM in there.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:20.350
And OK.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:21.175
Thank you.

00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:23.490
Hey, it's great having an
audience that knows

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.220
what I should do.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:25.010
So Firefox running.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:26.090
Thank you very much.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.050
And here's the same code.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.800
And glad you're paying attention
and helping me out.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:37.190
And it's running the same
as it ran in Chrome.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.550
So all this tooling really
helps us out, we believe.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.730
But you don't have to use the
tooling if you don't want to.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.660
All of the stuff is available
there to use

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.720
at the command line.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.360
DAN GROVE: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.690
So we certainly have people on
our team that will never use

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:54.950
an IDE ever.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.650
And they're actually perfectly
happy writing Dart code.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.510
These are the same people,
they use vi.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.930
They're really addicted to it.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:02.940
They're not going to switch.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.510
But all the tools
work fine there.

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.660
So you can run the Dart VM
on the command line.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:09.115
You can run the Dart Compiler
on the command line, produce

00:25:09.115 --> 00:25:10.870
your JavaScript for your
web application.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:11.640
You can use Dartium.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.720
You can use everything.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.890
So you don't have to buy into
all of the tools in order to

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.660
make this work.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.040
So let's get back to Swarm and
talk about the design choices

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.720
we made and how we
think modern apps

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.430
should be built in Dart.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.290
So going back to the goals here,
we really wanted Swarm

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.140
to be a great news reader that
was written in Dart.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.890
Why written in Dart?

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.720
Because we care a ton about
Dart, and we actually wanted

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.880
to learn about the language.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.100
And we wanted to iterate on
the language with a real

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.640
application.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.810
Speed is critical.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.570
If you work on the Dart Team,
you have to care about speed.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.820
There's just no way around it.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.990
So 60 frames per second is the
requirement these days.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.900
We needed an application that
could be customized to

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.830
different form factors.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.290
I remember the first time
we showed it to someone.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.500
The first question we got was,
so if you want to run this on

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.180
a phone, do you have to
rewrite the entire

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.840
application?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.970
And the answer is no.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.030
We tried to design it in such
a way that we could actually

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.490
build customized UIs relatively
straightforwardly.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.290
And finally, we wanted it
to be offline capable.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.120
And not just so that the demo
would work when we were

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.610
talking at Google I/O.
But there are a

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.580
lot of other reasons.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.710
Most of you, I guess all of us,
will wind up with these

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:19.550
Wi-Fi-enabled tablets that
have no connectivity when

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.780
they're outside a Wi-Fi zone or
when they're at Google I/O.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:25.240
So people that have those are
going to care a ton about

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.430
being offline.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.290
People that live in the US care
a lot about this too.

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.060
Because the mobile networks here
are pretty lousy, and you

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.030
often wind up without
connectivity.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:39.210
So we needed to meet all these
goals to make Swarm work well.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.390
So we started with the UI.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.570
And we wanted to build
a great layout.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.050
And we wanted to build a system
that would work nicely

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.550
on phones, on tablets,
and on the desktop.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.190
We really liked what we saw
when we went out and

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.365
looked at CS's grid.

00:26:51.365 --> 00:26:54.120
We thought, that's super cool.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.890
Unfortunately, it's
not everywhere we

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:56.900
needed it to be yet.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.220
It's critical to us that we not
break the web and that we

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.320
actually build Dart applications
that work across

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.430
all the browsers that
we're targeting.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.350
We also looked at CS's
flex box, which is

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.080
also kind of cool.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.340
But it has some problems.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.930
One is that it doesn't
support animation.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.430
And animation is really critical
if we're going to

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.290
build really great apps.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.000
It's also not identical
cross browser.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.570
And we didn't really
want to do a lot of

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.690
tweaking across browsers.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.770
And then we had a revelation.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.580
We thought about building this
and doing layout in code.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.360
And that's kind of nice.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.550
Because layout in code could
be the same everywhere.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.450
And you can actually get
animations that work.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.340
And we can build on all this
awesome VM speed that has been

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.900
developed over the
last five years.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.110
We don't have to rely on only
the browser primitives.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.240
We can actually do interesting
stuff in code.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.590
And that was what we decided
to do for the

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.630
layout engine here.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.310
Underneath the layout, we
thought that we would actually

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.330
try to take a fairly structured
approach to

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:53.470
building the application.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.120
And it's kind of a mouthful,
like the

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.580
Model-View-ViewModel Approach.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.530
And this has been an approach
that's been taken, basically,

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.790
since the mid-2000s for rich
client applications.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.570
And the general idea here
is that you have Views.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.020
And each of those Views is
coupled to its own ViewModel.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.800
And the ViewModel essentially
maintains state that is

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.460
related to the View but that
isn't the same as the true

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.100
model that stores the data.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.330
So ViewModels often have
transient state.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.950
They often interact
with each other.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.430
And they essentially mediate
between the core data model

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.880
and the UI.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.510
Underneath the data layer,
we can actually

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.240
connect to the cloud.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.480
And the nice thing is, if we
build our application this

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.400
way, we can actually deal with
lack of connectivity to the

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.880
cloud, which is important.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.580
So let's walk through Swarm
and take a look at these

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.320
different parts.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.430
So first of all, the model.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.380
The model is the true
application state, and by that

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.860
I mean that all of the data
that we need to be able to

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.280
build the application
lives in the model.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.860
One of the important things for
us is that, in order to

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.890
have things like offline and
local acceleration where

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:02.650
you're actually responding to
results on the client, you

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:03.980
actually need to be
able to construct

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.100
the UI on the client.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.960
And we can do that, because we
have these powerful VMs now.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.770
There are a lot of other neat
things that you can get if you

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.120
actually build a model
correctly.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.720
One is tab consistency.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.940
This is something that annoys me
constantly as I have Gmail

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.420
open on a couple of
different tabs.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.810
And one tab says I have 20,000
unread messages, and the other

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.960
one says I have 20,001
unread messages.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.440
It's really irritating.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.650
We can actually use things like
shared workers on the web

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.670
to have a shared model between
different tabs and start

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.290
getting tabs that are
actually consistent.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.420
And when that day comes, it
will be a fantastic thing.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.550
We can also get strong data
and View separation.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.470
And that's really nice, because
then we can actually

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.010
build different Views and
different UIs without

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.320
rebuilding the entire
application.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.930
So let's look at what the pieces
of the Swarm model are.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:53.850
So first of all, we
have the sections.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.260
And these are the sections of
news that I've decided to

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:56.970
subscribe to.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:02.840
So no surprise, Google is one of
them, Geek is one of them,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.100
all the usual things.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.950
And then we have feeds.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.620
And the feeds are essentially
RSS feeds that

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.670
are stored per section.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.740
And then in the model, we
have articles per feed.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.260
And these articles are
not what you're

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:14.960
seeing on the screen.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.030
These articles are the actual
full text of the articles.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.790
We'll turn that into
UI in a little bit.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.870
But the entire content of the
article is stored here.

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.930
Once we have the model, we can
pop up the stack a little bit

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:30.450
into the ViewModel.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.930
And the ViewModel is essentially
responsible for

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.030
transforming the model
for the View.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.850
It also performs all the
interactions between the View

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:39.430
and the actual application.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.410
You can think of the View as
really being the UI side of

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.180
things and the ViewModel being
where those UI events get

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.320
modeled into something that
deals with the rest of the

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.570
application.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.600
You can also have Events here.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.590
You might have data that's
changing on the cloud and

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:54.240
popping up through the model, or
changing in some other tab

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.350
and then popping up
through the model.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.330
All these things happen
in the ViewModel.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.560
And we build one ViewModel for
each View in the system.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.890
There's also a lot of
transient state

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.070
that's stored here.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.020
For instance, in the Swarm
ViewModel, you'd have things

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.480
like the Current Section.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.350
And you can see if you're really
close, that there's a

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:13.920
little carrot up underneath
the top.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.260
And you can see the top is
actually written in red.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.230
Current Feed so that you know
what feeds you should be

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.010
displaying on the screen.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.130
The Current Article so that you
know where in the where in

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.860
the list your cursor is, and
then the Article Tiles.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.820
And the Article Tiles are
things like the title, a

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.160
thumbnail for the article, an
abstract for the article, that

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.250
sort of thing.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.030
And then, as we rise up the
stack, it's time to get into

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.000
the View itself.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.910
And we think of Views as being
composable UI units that are

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.320
responsible for handling
all UI interaction.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.320
We build these out of Dart
and HTML and CSS.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.680
We looked at a number of other
options, but in the end, HTML

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.870
and CSS are actually a really
good story for the web.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.910
If you need to, you can always
build a Custom View that

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.750
decides to render itself in
WebGL or Canvas, but we expect

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.890
that most Views will actually
get rendered with HTML.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.850
Views are actual Dart objects.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:08.340
So this is fantastic, because
you can start doing things

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.850
like deriving them
from each other.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.600
So you can build a menu, and
then you could build a

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:15.590
specialized kind of menu and
actually take advantage of the

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.770
object-oriented nature
of Dart.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.740
Views are also responsible
for handling events.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.750
And they're responsible for
handling events that come in,

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.490
in two directions.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:24.840
One is they need to handle
UI events that are

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.800
coming in from the users.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.510
These might be clicks, or
scrolls, or keyboard events.

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:31.670
The View is also responsible
for handling events that

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.130
bubble up from the ViewModels.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.690
So these could be events that
come in from another View and

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.450
get mediated through
ViewModels.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.610
Or they could be data that's
changing out in the cloud and

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.680
gets pushed up to
the application.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.850
So let's go take a look at
Swarm in the Editor.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.435
VIJAY MENON: So yeah, let's do
a deep dive on Swarm now.

00:32:48.435 --> 00:32:50.390
And this is a much bigger
application.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:54.190
So let's also come at this from
the mindset that we're

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.500
actually trying to tackle
here, which is large

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.510
applications in a production
environment.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.630
Imagine you are a new team
member on a team that's

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.570
writing Swarm.

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:06.880
And you're looking at this
code for the first time.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.850
Can you just jump in
and be productive?

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.480
That's the thing that we're
trying to measure.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:17.400
So let's take a look at Swarm
and find, basically, the main

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.510
HTML page here.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:23.430
It looks a lot like "hello." If
we look down at the bottom,

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.820
it's a bit more complicated,
obviously.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:29.010
But we, again, see the
application Dart, with

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.260
swarm.dart, the main
entry point.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:33.320
And also, this Dart to
JS that will let us

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.970
boot-strap and test out.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.120
We have this nice application
View.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.710
So instead of looking at a long
laundry list, you can

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.770
actually see the different
libraries that we used to

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.910
compose together and
create Swarm.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.250
So we have this entry point.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.670
We've actually put most of the
application itself in a

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.850
separate library that we import,
create a new Swarm app

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.380
instance, and run.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.950
And you don't have to
go searching for

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.010
this again using grep.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.480
You can just dive in and see
what's going on here.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.060
So this gets us to
the Swarm app.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.679
We can take a look at that.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.639
This is the Swarm class.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.489
And the main elements that Dan
talked about are here.

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:19.460
Sections is, essentially, the
model, the data model.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.520
FrontView is the
top-level View.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.880
We'll get to that in a moment.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.270
And Swarm state corresponds
to the ViewModel or the

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.600
transient UI state.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.159
Let's take a look at what this
constructor's doing.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:33.340
The first thing it's doing
is initializing from URL.

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:34.790
Let's take a look at
what that does.

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:36.630
We can just dive in here.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.449
And we can see that,
OK, there's--

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:39.870
Again, you can notice
to-dos here.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:40.760
This is, again, an app.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.190
You're just diving into any
production app, it's probably

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.080
going to have some
to-dos in it.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.940
It's always evolving, right?

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:47.750
And you want to find
out, which path is

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.630
this thing going on.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.570
Well, again, we want
to be able to

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.070
just set a break point.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:55.770
So let's run this, and we can
see right away that, hey, it

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.730
went down this path.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.210
So we've got an idea, at least
in this mode, of which way

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.120
it's going.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.520
So we can follow
the execution.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.940
And let's go ahead and run
that to completion.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.080
And we can see--

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.890
Oh, this is running in Chrome.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:18.680
Let's get the version
here in Dartium.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.280
And you can see that here's the
app running in Dartium.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:29.390
And if you are used to Chrome
Developer Tools, you can just

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:30.710
load that up as well.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.730
And you can see that all of that
is actually starting to

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:37.150
get pretty nicely integrated,
as well, in Dartium.

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:40.090
So just as a quick thing, let's
just try loading this

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.700
application and seeing what's
actually coming across.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.740
And this is all being served
from the local file

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.510
system, in this case.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.920
One thing you'll notice
is that there's

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.350
lots of Dart files.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.630
If you include transitively all
the libraries that we're

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.910
pulling through together
here, there's about

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.100
60-some Dart files.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.740
So as you're just editing and
debugging, this is great.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.740
Because I just change one of
those files, I reload, and I

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.520
get the new effect right here.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.170
And of course, as you compile
this to JavaScript, it's going

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.300
to do the smart thing and
create one or very few

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.770
JavaScript files that
you deploy.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.790
And when you eventually deploy,
Dart will do similar

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.040
things there as well.

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.840
So now you've kind of gotten
familiar with the app.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.390
Let's suppose you have
an initial task.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:30.560
And the task we have is, as you
dive into a news article,

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.250
we want to show the author
as well as the feed name.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:37.100
So let's say that we want to go
ahead and make that change.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.390
All right.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.160
Let's go back to Swarm.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160
We saw where the top-level
View is.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:46.110
We can go in and dive
into there.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:51.210
The top-level View is
essentially a compositional

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:51.950
set of Views.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.640
So if we look at the different
pieces in this class, we can

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:59.210
see here's a topView, the
headerView, the sliderMenu

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:02.190
Menu that goes across the top.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:07.160
And again, a lot of other
different names of Views.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.130
If we just click on something,
we can kind of get a sense of

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.550
what's what by it, because the
comments just show up at--

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:15.920
The editor's able to see where
the definitions are, embed the

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.220
documentation, and pull
it as needed.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.880
And it turns out that
StoryContentView, reading

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.580
around a little bit, is the
one we want to modify.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.990
So let's take a look at that.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.000
So the first complaint we
might have is, well,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.560
StoryContentView, that
was a little bit

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.420
hard for me to find.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.080
Gee, it would be nice if I could
change that name so the

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.520
next person that has
to dive into it can

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.600
find it more easily.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.070
So it turns out that that's
a pretty easy thing

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.450
to do here in Dart.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.180
We can just go ahead
and rename it.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:54.140
And we can call it
ExpandedStoryView.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.540
And the editor's able to do the
right thing here, and just

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.420
go ahead and change.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.360
And you could see that this
constructor here magically

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.820
changed as well.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.020
And if we go to a terminal--

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.440
Dan mentioned grep.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.280
Sometimes we like to do tools
like grep or diff.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.730
And we can see that a number
of changes have been made

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:19.450
throughout the code base,
in this case.

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.520
Not too many.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.180
This particular View isn't
accessed very many places.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.060
Let's do something maybe a
little bit more risky.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.570
The item shows up all over the
place in our core code.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:36.150
So that's a case where you don't
want to just do Search

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:39.130
and Replace, because you'll
probably end up changing a lot

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.430
of things you didn't
mean to change.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.500
And again, the Rename
facility here is

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.420
actually, it's quite nice.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.580
It's able to just use the
structure and the types to

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:49.050
know what the right
thing to do is.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:54.540
And let's go ahead and Name
Item Article here.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.080
And you can see it
does that live.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.690
And if we go back and grep
again for "item," there's

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:02.800
still a bunch of
"items" there.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.610
So it did the right thing.

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.310
Of course, we should actually
make sure that

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.795
it runs still, right?

00:39:08.795 --> 00:39:10.810
Because otherwise,
it's no good.

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.900
And sure enough,
it still runs.

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:13.560
It does the right thing.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.490
It's able to reason
about the code.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.950
The tools help you out, which
is the goal here.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:20.240
So again, we said we wanted to
actually make a change here.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.420
So we ran into a few things we
wanted to fix just to make the

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.670
code a little bit more
understandable.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.410
Let's take a look.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.260
So the main thing that any View
in this app is doing is

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.240
it's rendering.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.640
And it's an abstraction over
HTML, but it's not a huge

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.200
abstraction.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.920
Every time we render, we produce
a new HTML element

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:38.640
that goes into the app.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.540
And in this case, it's taking
the contents of that article.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.100
It's doing some scrubbing.

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.790
And we showed how to build
the DOM elements

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.460
compositionally by code.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.300
Sometimes it's convenient
to use a large template.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.560
And Dart makes that easy with
the string interpolation, it's

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.270
a nice feature.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:59.630
You can take a big string, a
multiline string, and you'll

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.660
notice these little dollar-sign
operations where

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.830
we can just call in to code and
embed data from the code

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:08.210
right into the string.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.140
So the Feed Title is here.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:17.680
Let's go in and add the
author of the article.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.980
So even though we're inside of
a string here, the editor is

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.550
able to understand the context,
see that there's this

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.840
article in Scope, and tell
you what the fields are.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.870
It knows the Type of that.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.480
And I can just see, hey, there's
an Author Field here

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.490
and go ahead and use it.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.120
And Save.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:44.720
And let's reload and see if
it did the right thing.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.430
Oh, this is--

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.040
Sorry.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.520
I keep going to Chrome.

00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.440
I haven't compiled yet.

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.780
So I need to go to Dartium,
because I haven't actually

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:52.640
recompiled.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.190
So Dartium gives me the nice
experience of just being able

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.340
to reload, because it's
this native support.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.620
And I can see right here that
next to the Feed Title I have

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.130
the author.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.860
So everything just worked.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.060
I'm done with my first change.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:10.275
So our experience with this
has been really positive.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.650
The goals that we set out really
seem to be working.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.360
We have a language here that's
much more toolable, easy for

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.800
us to jump in and use.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.500
And we feel that we're on the
right path for a whole

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.960
platform that makes it easier
to write large applications.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.630
You can take everything we've
shown here and download it

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.140
yourself and play with it.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.420
This is an early version
of the Dart platform.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.600
The interesting starting
point is dartlang.org.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.000
There's a lot to read there.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.090
The language specification
is pretty stable.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:46.110
It's not quite yet at 1.0.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.275
You can see the API
documentation for Dart:HTML,

00:41:49.275 --> 00:41:51.750
the other core libraries.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:55.860
You can download the latest
versions of the Dart Editor,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.230
Dartium, all our Command
Line Tools.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.560
And there's a mailing list there
that you can join-- it's

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.410
very active--

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:04.270
to join the community,
give us feedback.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.950
A lot of changes have been made
just based on feedback

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:07.590
from the community.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.100
It's been great.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.500
All the code, if you want to
build it yourself, or just

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.380
look at how it's implemented,
it's all there at

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.970
dart.googlecode.com.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.880
That includes Dartium, the
Dart2JS, Compiler, the Virtual

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.420
Machine, the Editor, all the
libraries, and Swarm, the

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.330
sample app there.

00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:28.190
So you can basically look at
all the code you want, muck

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:32.340
with it, tell us what you
learn, play with it.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.840
It's all there.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.360
You can learn a lot more at
Google I/O. If you didn't make

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:38.320
it to Lars' and Kasper's
talk, it's recorded.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.500
So you can find out more about
the Dart language.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.190
It's a great starting point.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:45.660
In this very room, there'll be
another talk in just a few

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.930
minutes on migrating code from
GWT to Dart, where Ray will

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.190
talk about that.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.450
And you can learn about
both of those.

00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:56.190
And then all afternoon, we
have Dart Office Hours.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.500
So you can find us, ask us
questions, and just get your

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:00.810
hands dirty with some
of the stuff.

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:04.240
If you really want to get your
hands dirty, come to the Code

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.560
Lab tomorrow that Seth and
Jamie will be running.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.970
A lot of us will be there.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:11.840
It's your chance to write
your first Dart app.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.000
DAN GROVE: Yeah,
so summing up.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.180
If you only remember three
things coming out of this

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.310
talk, first of all,
remember that the

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:18.830
web has changed hugely.

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.950
The last five years have really
delivered a whole lot

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.670
of changes in capabilities
and in speed.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.730
Secondly, in order to take
advantage of this, you've got

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.480
to be able to program
at scale, and Dart

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.850
enables you to do this.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.750
And finally, over the next year,
Dart will enable modern

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:35.530
web apps by providing a large
set of libraries to really

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.020
make this a straightforward
procedure.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:40.150
Thanks, and if you have
questions, the

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.930
mic is there, I believe.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:48.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:48.660
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:55.420
I wondered, our search engines
were indexing dot application.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:44:01.550
Do you have a way to build
static versions to

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.175
be crawled by robots?

00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:08.430
DAN GROVE: To allow it to
be crawled by robots.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.010
We haven't done anything in
particular on this yet, but

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.650
I'm sure we will.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:17.070
AUDIENCE: So basically when you
write a dot application,

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.852
it won't appear in
Google Results.

00:44:20.852 --> 00:44:22.760
VIJAY MENON: So we expect
when people deploy Dart

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.440
applications that you'll
be able to--

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.680
And you can do server-side
detection to check whether the

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:32.870
browser that's hitting your site
has native Dart support

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.890
and serve accordingly
Dart or JavaScript.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:37.340
So I haven't thought
very deeply about

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.140
your specific case.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.950
But that should be a case where,
again, you can take

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:40.880
advantage of the fact that this

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.460
just runs on all browsers.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.740
DAN GROVE: Yeah, it should be
no different from running a

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:45.990
JavaScript application.

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:49.970
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.300
So I realize you're going to
have a talk next about the

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.980
transition from GWT to Dart.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.290
But I was wondering if you could
just mention briefly

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.820
what the differences
are between the

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:02.020
goals of the two projects?

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.780
They seem to have a
lot of overlap.

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:05.270
DAN GROVE: Yeah.

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:07.690
So I think there's actually--

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.900
So first of all, there's both
the talk today, and then

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.770
there's a talk later this week
about the future of GWT.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:18.200
So we have not actually paid a
ton of attention to GWT on the

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.890
Dart project.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:20.960
We're really trying to build
a whole new platform.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.250
And the goals may be similar.

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.120
But we also think that we can
do much better than Java in

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.500
terms of the developer
workflow.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.460
VIJAY MENON: If you went to Lars
and Kaspar's talk, you

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:33.390
can see that when they created
the language, it borrowed a

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.510
lot of elements from different
languages, including Java.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.350
So Dart really tries to hit the
space between JavaScript

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.180
and Java and get a lot of
the best of both worlds.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.190
You get the checking and
toolability from Java but also

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.250
some of the terseness and
simplicity from JavaScript.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:52.550
Ray's going to go into detail
on some side-by-side

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:55.070
comparisons of how the things
really compare.

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:57.480
So I highly recommend that if
you're interested in that, you

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.420
stick around for that talk.

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:05.850
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
how the performance of Dart

00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:09.100
code running in the VM compares
to V8 optimized

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.520
JavaScript.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.670
DAN GROVE: Where's Lars?

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:15.730
I think the answer is that
it's not there yet.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.390
If you looked at the VM today,
it exceeds where Chrome was

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.890
when Chrome launched
by a decent amount.

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:25.470
But there is still
a long way to go.

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.280
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, I mean
performance is something

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:30.380
that's being actively
worked on.

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.800
It's a big theme, so definitely
at release point,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.290
it will get to better than V8.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:40.030
If you run natively it should
be pretty much close to

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:43.110
hand-optimized code
if you compile.

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.890
For us it's nice because it's
already pretty fast.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.450
And it's getting faster
underneath us every day.

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:50.530
So that's pretty cool.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.310
DAN GROVE: Yeah we have the
advantage of working on a

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:56.810
project that has among the best
VM performance people in

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:57.790
the world working on it.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.330
And they're unbelievably driven
to make this faster.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.940
VIJAY MENON: One great thing of
this being very open too,

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.470
is that if you complain about
performance on a certain thing

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.410
on the mailing list, it tends to
get a lot of attention too.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:12.420
So the things we care about,
again, performance wasn't so

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.850
much of an issue when
we did Swarm.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.700
So we were able to get the
performance we wanted, and we

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.686
were able to--

00:47:18.686 --> 00:47:20.730
AUDIENCE: Is that a milestone
that you have for like--

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.120
I know the Dart release is
coming up in fall 2012.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.240
Is that something you
have in a miles--

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.830
DAN GROVE: You know, I don't
know that we've published an

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:29.965
official goal for that,
but I suspect one

00:47:29.965 --> 00:47:31.215
will be coming soon.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys,
for a great talk.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:41.750
The question is, obviously,
people have quite a large code

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.030
base over existing JavaScript.

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:47.650
Do you consider implementing
any way to call

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.700
JavaScript from Dart?

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.190
DAN GROVE: That's a
great question.

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:51.370
VIJAY MENON: That's a
fantastic question.

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:52.850
That's something that we're
actually actively

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.170
looking at right now.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:57.310
And we do want to have a good
solution for that in place in

00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.040
the next few months.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.050
DAN GROVE: In fact, that's
something that you're going to

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.520
be working on, I believe.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.260
VIJAY MENON: I think I
signed up for that.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:06.440
So look for something.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.450
We're looking at a few
different solutions.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.580
If you keep an eye on the
mailing list, you can actually

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:13.660
look at the details of the code
reviews of the different

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.710
things that we're playing
around with there.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:18.840
We're trying to do it in a way
that you get a good experience

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.020
when you're running Dart
natively, as well as when

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.820
you're compiling Dart
to JavaScript.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.380
And we're trying to make a very
nice interop layer that

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.560
performs pretty well.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.560
DAN GROVE: Thanks.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.930
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, how does Dart--

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:37.635
All these presentations that I
see, they all compare to the

00:48:37.635 --> 00:48:40.200
current version of JavaScript,
whereas the next version,

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.735
Harmony, has got a lot of the
same things I'm seeing.

00:48:42.735 --> 00:48:44.140
It's got modules, string

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.940
interpolation, lexical scoping.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.280
It's got a lot of
things that--

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:53.680
So I'm wondering, I guess, how
does Dart stack up to the next

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.690
version of JavaScript?

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.740
And are you worried
about adoption?

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.770
Is that your biggest
thing, or--

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.690
DAN GROVE: Well, we care hugely

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.910
about adoption, obviously.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:02.760
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.140
But ultimately, this is about
making web apps great.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:10.020
And if JavaScript gets
better and better,

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.770
that's a good thing.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.650
And it is getting better
and better.

00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.350
Lars and Kasper can
go into a lot of

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:19.270
detail there where they've--

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.780
You can't always
just add to the

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.210
language and make it better.

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.620
There are challenges,
particularly at the

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.080
implementation level, and also
holes in the semantics that

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.260
are hard to get around.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:30.120
So there is an advantage,
at some point--

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.780
And JavaScript's been around
for a long time.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.940
There are advantages that we can
get from starting anew and

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.460
taking a lot of the lessons
from JavaScript.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.830
You might still be able to get
a lot of what you want coding

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:41.580
in JavaScript.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:43.270
I think everyone's experience
will vary.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:46.520
So what we would say is to try
out these different things and

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.920
see what works best for you.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.710
DAN GROVE: Yeah, and I think
Lars and Kasper would tell you

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:53.360
that, on a fundamental basis,
you can make Dart

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:56.350
significantly faster
than JavaScript.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:59.690
They're probably the best
qualified people in the world

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:00.540
to make that statement.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:01.993
And they're very
clear about it.

00:50:01.993 --> 00:50:02.680
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.630
And as far as adoption, do you
ever see it landing in Firefox

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.040
or other browsers,
the native VM?

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.830
DAN GROVE: That is so far away
that we can't even consider it

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:14.620
right now, which is why we
have to have a great

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.360
compilation story.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.630
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, Dart2JS is
really the deployment story,

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:19.300
even now for Chrome as well.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:22.580
And we've got to make that
really, really good.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.680
And Dart's been designed so
it can compile well to

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.340
JavaScript.

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.040
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.350
Thanks.

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:29.690
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.500
I'm curious about debugging.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.560
You showed how you set a
breakpoint in the IDE.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.720
Is this a browser plug-in,
or how does it work?

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.950
And does it mean that you
only can debug in

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:41.070
Dartium right now?

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:42.380
I can say a little
bit about that.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:47.510
So Chrome has support for
external debuggers.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.550
And I don't think we had to--

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.380
We had to do the hook-up
for the Dart VM.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:55.890
But otherwise, you can do
similar things with V8 and

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.210
external debuggers.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.690
And there's also the internal
dev tools in Chrome that you

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:04.940
can use as a debugger as well,
with V8 and JavaScript on

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.110
regular Chrome, and on
Dartium, that as

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:09.080
well as Dart code.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.260
So really, just using the
existing plumbing that's there

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:11.810
in the browser.

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.620
DAN GROVE: Yeah, and the other
approach you can use, of

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.850
course, is debugging the
JavaScript code that's

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:19.530
produced by the Compiler, which
is a pretty reasonable

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:19.830
experience.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.660
VIJAY MENON: There's actually
work going on right now in

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:23.830
using Source Maps.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.480
Chrome has Source Maps.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.310
So if you're compiling from any
language to JavaScript,

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:31.600
you can get a better debugging
experience and look at your

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.180
original source and see
how that [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:40.060
AUDIENCE: You probably can't
debug in IE or Firefox?

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.120
DAN GROVE: You would debug the
generated JavaScript code.

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.130
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.580
DAN GROVE: And that's a pretty
decent experience.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.370
We have a lot of experience
doing that, and it's not bad.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:50.970
AUDIENCE: And second question.

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.560
You said the IDE is
built on Eclipse.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.465
Is it an Eclipse plug-in,
or is it stand-alone?

00:51:56.465 --> 00:51:58.790
VIJAY MENON: It's stand-alone
right now, but

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.130
I think Lars actually--

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.830
DAN GROVE: I think he answered
this in the last one.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:02.280
VIJAY MENON: Answered
this question.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.300
So I'll just repeat what
he said, which is

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:05.330
that it will come.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.690
There will be an Eclipse
plug-in.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:07.260
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:08.198
Thank you.

00:52:08.198 --> 00:52:09.448
VIJAY MENON: Yep.

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:14.420
AUDIENCE: I was curious about
unit test support.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:15.860
DAN GROVE: Yeah.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:17.920
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, we care
a lot about unit test.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.960
There is a unit test library
that's been in Dart for a

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.900
long, long time.

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.690
And we use it pretty heavily.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.600
DAN GROVE: Yeah, and there's--

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.060
We're always adding new
testing support.

00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:30.680
So there's a new mocking
library that's going in

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.930
nowadays, for instance.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:36.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.490
I wonder about the commitment
that Google has to Dart.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:44.210
Is it just a playground where
you evaluate what's possible

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:45.380
and what's nice?

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:51.300
Or is Google actually putting
critical applications from

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.420
Google [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:57.040
DAN GROVE: Dart has started
being used inside Google to

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.920
build critical applications
at this point.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.760
I would tell you, in terms of

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.840
commitment, I'm pretty committed.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.300
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.340
DAN GROVE: We have a very large
team, and we're spending

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:09.860
a huge number of resources
to make Dart successful.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.760
VIJAY MENON: And we're working
pretty closely with those

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.460
teams to make it a success.

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.410
DAN GROVE: Yeah.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:17.242
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:17.242 --> 00:53:21.120
AUDIENCE: Do you have time for
one more fast question?

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.970
Is there any plans like to
support or maybe solely be

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:25.830
supported--

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:31.390
Can I run my Dart apps like
stand-alone on any V8

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:35.200
implementation outside of the
browser, just throwing away

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.490
the HTML part with
DOM and stuff.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:39.420
VIJAY MENON: Absolutely.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:41.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah like,
I mean, basically,

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.860
will it run on nojs?

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.395
Like if I just compile
and run it?

00:53:46.395 --> 00:53:49.570
VIJAY MENON: So nojs has been
a big source of inspiration.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.150
And I think as Kasper mentioned
in the last talk,

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:56.680
the Compiler is self-hosting
as well, right?

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:01.920
And it's a standalone app
written in Dart that reads

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.810
from the file system using
server-side APIs that we don't

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:06.360
make available in the browser.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.760
That is part of the long-term
version of Dart, to actually

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.380
have code that you can share.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but basically
the standard API should work,

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:14.890
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:14.890 --> 00:54:16.840
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, the core
libraries will work

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.570
everywhere.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:18.460
We want to make that--

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.120
We want to make it as easy as
possible to take code from the

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.050
server and put it in the
client, and vice versa.

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys.

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:28.620
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:34.350
In one of your demos you did a
query of Canvas elements, put

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:38.380
them into a non-generified
list, and then iterated

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.740
through those and was able to

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.650
context-assist out the 2D context.

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:44.170
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:45.140
AUDIENCE: How did you do that?

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.690
VIJAY MENON: That's
really cool.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:48.770
Actually, I only discovered
that this week.

00:54:48.770 --> 00:54:51.530
Like I said, the great thing
about having this active team

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.050
is that stuff just improves
under the hood.

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:56.455
And that was a new feature that
just started working, I

00:54:56.455 --> 00:54:57.590
think, in the last week.

00:54:57.590 --> 00:55:00.830
So the Dart Editor is
smart enough to do a

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:01.675
class hierarchy analysis.

00:55:01.675 --> 00:55:04.870
It essentially knows the base
type of what you've got.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:09.050
And it's able to look at the
sub-types and give you a list

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:12.430
of all the possibilities that
you could want to do.

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:16.340
Now if I had put list bracket
Canvas element, I would have

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:19.530
gotten a shorter list of
completion, potentially, when

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:20.340
I pulled stuff out.

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.070
So it can still be sort
of advantageous.

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:23.950
And we're still trying to figure
out what the right

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:25.950
balance of that is.

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.070
Being able to put that type
information is useful, because

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:30.590
we do-- and I didn't show
an example of this.

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:34.010
But you do have the opportunity
to validate that

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:36.510
at run time and get some
early error checking.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:38.600
You can kind of think of it
as assertions in the code.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.280
But yeah, the tooling is able to
actually reason a lot about

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:46.520
the code because it knows
the structure.

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:50.830
So it grabbed all of the
attributes of anything that

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:52.400
extended, element or whatever.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:52.690
And--

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.230
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, so if it
knows that the base type is

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:57.551
element, it's able
to show you--

00:55:57.551 --> 00:56:00.390
I don't know if this showed up
this time, but if I start

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.970
typing "context," I can see the
context field that's on

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:05.580
the audio element as well as the
context 2D that's on the

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:06.620
Canvas element.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:10.440
And if I put the more specific
type in there, I would see a

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.150
more filtered list.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.990
AUDIENCE: And I assume if you
were to put an attribute that

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:16.240
didn't exist, you'd
get some type of

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.240
runtime error or something?

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.610
VIJAY MENON: If you put
an attribute that

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.150
doesn't exist, the--

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:23.520
DAN GROVE: Yeah, you'll actually
get a runtime--

00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:24.195
It's a run--

00:56:24.195 --> 00:56:26.485
VIJAY MENON: First of all, if it
can tell it statically, it

00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:28.760
will tell you a warning
right there.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:31.020
DAN GROVE: But it'll still
let you compile it.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.910
VIJAY MENON: It would still
let you compile it.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.660
But the more common case is that
you actually try to get

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:39.095
the context 2D, but you have an
audio element or a div or

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.020
something like that, right.

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.860
And there, you will
fail at runtime.

00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.075
And you will get an error,
an exception.

00:56:43.075 --> 00:56:45.390
And if you're running in the
debugger, it will stop right

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.320
there at the point at which
it made that call.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:49.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.890
Cool.

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:51.140
Thanks.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.590
AUDIENCE: When will I be able to
deploy my server-side Dart

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.330
code to Google App Engine?

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.990
DAN GROVE: I don't know.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:04.680
We haven't made any announcement
about that yet.

00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.420
VIJAY MENON: Good question,
though.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.590
DAN GROVE: It's a
good question.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.000
OK, so I guess that's it.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:09.510
VIJAY MENON: Thanks
for coming.

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:10.760
DAN GROVE: Thanks.
