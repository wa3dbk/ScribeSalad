00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.120
SETH LADD: Cool.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:02.640
All Right.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.380
So if you've joined us, please
mute, and we'll open up for

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.240
questions later.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.190
But welcome everybody
who's watching on

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.400
air and in the hangout.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.590
This is Dartisans Episode Two.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.430
We have two special guests
today from the Dart team,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.220
Vijay Menon and Anton Muhin.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.383
Hi, guys.

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:22.820
ANTON MUHIN: Hello.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.281
VIJAY MENON: Hello.

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:26.250
SETH LADD: So thanks for
joining us today.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.700
This is really awesome.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.340
Let's get right into it.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.760
Tell everyone who's watching,
and our YouTube friends at

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.940
home, what are your roles
on the Dart team?

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.922
What are you doing
in these days?

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:41.514
VIJAY MENON: You go
first, Anton?

00:00:41.514 --> 00:00:42.280
ANTON MUHIN: OK.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.160
Thank you, Vijay.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.250
So we're working on Dart's
[? room ?], which is home to

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.920
Dart VM and to Chromium.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.060
So we can get the best
performance we can provide,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.958
the best developer experience,
and stuff like that.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.600
SETH LADD: So you're working
on integrating the Dart VM

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.530
into Chromium.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.610
That sounds pretty exciting.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.790
I know a lot of people are
looking forward to that.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.675
Vijay, what are you working
on these days?

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.020
VIJAY MENON: Generally, my
background's compilers,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.750
runtimes, and I've been working
the past while also on

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.680
DOM integration, browser
integration, of the Dart

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.490
language, the Dart APIs.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.570
And also very closely with Anton
on seeing what it's like

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.350
integrating the Dart VM
into the browser.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.310
SETH LADD: Awesome.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.250
Sounds like you have a sweet
spot of background to help the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.130
Dart team out, here.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.990
Anton, what had you been doing
before the Dart team?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.480
ANTON MUHIN: Before the team, I
was engaged into performance

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.780
work on the DOM bindings
and on the [? 8th ?]

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.310
virtual machine.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.760
Also I had some exposure
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.710
before.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.540
And I really hope this
experience will help us make

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.445
the best integration possible.

00:01:57.445 --> 00:02:00.470
SETH LADD: I would imagine that
experience on the v8 team

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.680
would definitely be relevant
to the Dart team.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.030
What are some of the lessons
that you learned from working

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.939
on the v8 team that's helped
you with the Dart project?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.480
ANTON MUHIN: Everything was
minimal [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.720
matters when you talk about
performance, because sometimes

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.120
[? there ?]

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.460
[? was ?]

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.710
much more to just if you can
remove a couple of comments,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.750
you get the biggest
[? core ?].

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.770
So it's an exciting
project, actually.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.880
It's exciting stuff
to work on.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.150
SETH LADD: I know that
performance has always been a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.570
goal of the Dart team,
so that's great.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.275
Well, you guys have been working
really hard today, and

00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:40.860
I know we have a special
announcement today.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.120
What are we announcing today?

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.650
VIJAY MENON: We're announcing
something?

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.750
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] down
in Seattle.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.786
I think that was it, right?

00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:49.250
SETH LADD:

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.482
That was fast. [LAUGHTER]

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.390
VIJAY MENON: Anton, do we have
a special announcement?

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.720
ANTON MUHIN: I believe so.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.340
You go ahead, Vijay.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.130
VIJAY MENON: Sure.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.480
Well, you know, any of you
guys who have been paying

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.130
attention, or just listen to
what Anton and I work on, know

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.040
that we've been working
on integrating the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.040
Dart VM in the browser.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.660
The builds are public, and I
know a few of you brave souls

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.670
have actually built it from
our public [? repo. ?]

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.600
We've been working on hosting
binaries and making it easier

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.040
for you guys to do that.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.690
And I believe Seth could
probably give you the actual

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.795
time, but we'll have some
instructions later today, you

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:36.495
think, Seth?

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:37.400
SETH LADD: Yeah.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.340
VIJAY MENON: On exactly how
to download binaries.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.920
Mac and Linux today.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.920
Windows very, very soon.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.690
Fingers crossed.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.830
We're just working on a few
things with the VM team.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.360
But Mac and Linux should be
there today that you can play

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.100
around with.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.570
Binaries this time, so you don't
have to actually build

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.410
it yourself.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.550
And it's actually just going
to be the output of our

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.320
continuous build, so you'll
get the latest

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.770
and greatest stuff.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.060
That said, there are
a few things we

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.100
want to talk through.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.470
I don't know if it's a good time
to do it, but where we

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.475
can give a demo later
on, maybe.

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:17.070
SETH LADD: Yeah, that's
fantastic.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.730
So to reiterate, for everyone
who's just joining us, welcome

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.779
to Dartisans Episode Two.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:25.520
And we have just announced that
we'll be releasing public

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.200
binaries of Dartium, which is
Chromium with the Dart virtual

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.820
machine integrated into it.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.580
And we'll make these binaries
available later

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.920
today on our website.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.760
This is huge news.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.940
This is another step forward
for our batteries included

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.170
Dart platform.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.380
When we announced and launched
last October, we had a virtual

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.090
machine, language spec, early
revision, libraries, and now

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.010
finally, moving closer to this
batteries included idea by

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.050
putting Dart VM into Chromium.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.300
So this is great news.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.600
Thanks, guys.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.040
Can you talk a little bit about
what it actually means

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.435
to integrate Dart
with Chromium?

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:08.360
I mean, exactly what
did you do?

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.330
VIJAY MENON: As you heard from
Anton, he worked before on

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.350
putting v8s into the browser.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.780
And this is kind of another
exercise in doing that.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.470
Embedding the VM itself in the
browser means kind of drilling

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.020
all the holes through, getting
all of the DOM integration so

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.140
that you can actually interact
with the browser's DOM from

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.390
the Dart language.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.590
Integrating it with things like
developer tools, adding

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.180
the support for the MIME
types, and so on.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.240
Doing a lot of performance
work.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.460
So there's quite a bit to it.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.440
Chrome is a big beast, and
figuring out how to get this

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.780
to work, and work alongside the
v8s has kind of been the

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.030
main challenge.

00:05:58.845 --> 00:06:00.420
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.360
SETH LADD: Go ahead, Anton.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.010
ANTON MUHIN: Sorry.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.360
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.750
cases you should be aware of,
because all this stuff,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.170
something like when you upload,
[? you just ?] see

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.500
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.350
[? collect ?]

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.610
some stuff, and how the API
should behave, how the

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.480
application should be started,
how you can then [? upload ?]

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.970
application.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.100
There's a lot of difficult
and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.030
we have addressed, we
hope to address.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.450
And we wanted to explore, and
ideally to provide the best

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.890
environment for the
applications.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.306
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:36.306 --> 00:06:38.970
SETH LADD: So if the Dart
virtual machine is now

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.120
directly inside Chromium, that
means I can run Dart code

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.240
straight up in Chromium.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.720
But what about other browsers?

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.686
What do we have answers
for those?

00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:52.690
VIJAY MENON: Well, compiling
to JavaScript using the

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.220
Dart-to-JavaScript compiler
is still very, very

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.320
important to Dart.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.900
That's how you will get it to
run on other, modern browsers.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.900
And to emphasize, it's not
in Chromium proper.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.880
It's in our branch of Chromium
that we're calling Dartium.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.330
This is very much a development
tool that we're

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.550
working on and experimenting.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.550
It is work in progress.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.440
Those of you who really use it
will know that you're really

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.130
using it when you managed to
get an "Aw, snap" screen in

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.000
Chrome, and so on.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.660
So very much work in progress.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.920
We're trying to prove to
ourselves and everyone else

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.870
that having native Dart support
in the browser is a

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.210
good thing, and we're hoping
for feedback on that.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.640
I think that's kind of the
point we're at right now.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.490
Early feedback is if
people like this

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.800
for development purposes.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.560
They love the ability to be able
to just edit their Dart

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.930
code and just reload in the
browser and see it working.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.450
And as we go forward, the VM
team is working really hard on

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.050
performance.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.040
We're working closely with
them on performance with

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.820
respect to rendering
in the browser.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.400
And you should see
a lot of those

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.150
improvements coming along.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.450
So we're looking for feedback
to see, does this make the

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.550
experience better, both with
developing Dart applications

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.415
and running Dart applications,
and I think we go from there.

00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:15.335
Improve it in Chrome first.

00:08:15.335 --> 00:08:16.840
SETH LADD: That's an
excellent point.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.240
This is very much a technology
preview.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.890
Along with the whole Dart
project, which is still in

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.290
technology preview as we add
features to the language, we

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.215
smooth out the libraries, and
launch this stuff very early,

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:32.419
so as you say, get feedback
from developers.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.710
How can developers give
us their feedback?

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:35.960
Any recommendations there?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.480
VIJAY MENON: Tell us what works,
what doesn't work.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.280
In particular, file bugs.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.010
It's a lot of the things people
have been doing with

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.730
the Dart language and so on.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.110
A lot of these things are
just coming live.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.790
Developer tools, support.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.480
There's some preliminary
stuff in there.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.730
It's going to continue
improving.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.440
Give us feedback on what works,
what doesn't work.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.340
When things crash, please
file bugs on us.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.250
If things don't work, please
file bugs on us.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.970
That's a big reason why this
is going out early.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.310
ANTON MUHIN: And just
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.860
We are really looking
for feedback.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.740
We just did a couple of
decisions when implementing

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.650
Dart, Dartium, and in
some cases, we just

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.180
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.320
We really hope to get feedback
from people who do web

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.670
application programming so we
can revisit our old decisions

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.580
and make things more
convenient, more

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.740
easy for you to use.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.096
So we're really, really looking
for your feedback.

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:48.720
SETH LADD: So specifically, if
you want to send us bugs and

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.390
issues, please do
at dartbug.com.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.290
That's a nice shortcut to get
to our issue tracker.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.340
So that's dartbug.com.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.460
And on dartlang.org, you'll see
links to our mailing list

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.090
where there's lots of active
discussion, and many of our

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.660
Dart team participate there.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.780
So lots of different ways to
send us your feedback.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.880
We launched this stuff early
in developer preview

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.900
specifically to get
your feedback, so

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.230
please don't be shy.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.190
For everyone who's joining us,
this is Dartisans Episode Two,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.740
with special guest from
the Dart team.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.340
We've just announced the
binaries of Dart VM integrated

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.410
into Chromium will be available

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.270
later today for download.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.260
And we'll take questions for
everyone, so please add

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.390
questions to our Google+ posts
if you're not joining us in

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.720
the hangout, and we will route
those into our guests.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.830
In fact, we already got a
question here from Google+.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.940
John asks, why is it that the
Dart support was shipped into

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.300
a separate build of Chromium
in the first place, rather

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.735
than just shipping it into
the Chromium builds?

00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:58.030
ANTON MUHIN: The reason
is actually simple.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.180
Dart is complicated and
very big system.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.610
Dart [? and ?]

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.980
[? the ?]

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:02.720
[? bindings ?].

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.720
And we don't [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.380
right now, but we have all
these resources out.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.690
So we don't want to compromise
stability, the ability of

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.010
Chrome, its current stage of
development of Dartium

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.050
integration, but we are really
aiming for that later on.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.940
So when we think we're in better
shape, and we don't

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:25.150
provide any security risk,
and instability risk, any

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:29.540
slowdowns from Chrome when we
don't compromise on any point,

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.456
we'll call to have Dart
integrated into Chrome.

00:11:33.456 --> 00:11:36.090
VIJAY MENON: And to follow up
on that point, I want to

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.370
emphasize that this is
a developer release.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.235
Please don't use this for
day-to-day browsing.

00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:45.970
As Anton said, this hasn't gone
through the stringent

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.100
security that we do this
with Chrome builds.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.570
It doesn't autoupdate.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.200
And we basically set these
things to expire in about a

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.790
week or two, so we want
you to download--

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.790
this is, again, early.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:06.090
We need to get it more stable
before we can get this into

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.620
Chromium proper, or
Chrome proper.

00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:13.600
SETH LADD: And I think the
question everyone's asking is

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.060
where can developers get this?

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.700
We will post links of this on
dartlang.org later today, and

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.990
it'll be real easy for you to go
and download, just like you

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.520
can download the Editor,
et cetera.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.260
So just watch for dartlang.org
later today, where you can get

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:28.970
your hands on this.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.500
This is cool stuff.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.530
And Vijay, you answered
the other question.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.090
Will it be automatically
updated?

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.740
I think you said the answer is
no, this is not our normal

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.620
Chrome or Chromium channel.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.250
This is a standalone, kind
of snapshot build.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.880
Is that the right way
to think about that?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.901
VIJAY MENON: Right.

00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:47.727
Right.

00:12:47.727 --> 00:12:50.780
SETH LADD: So now that we have
the Dart virtual machine

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.230
inside a build of Chromium,
can developers run both

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.235
JavaScript and Dart
on the same page?

00:13:01.372 --> 00:13:04.130
VIJAY MENON: Yes, they can.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.390
That's one of those things that
Anton talked about it.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:13.820
Right now, you can't invoke one
directly from the other.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.500
And that's probably going to
stay that way because of a lot

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.660
of the technical issues
involved.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:22.830
The way you can communicate
with--

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.340
there'll probably a couple
different ways you can

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:27.670
communicate between JavaScript
and Dart.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.650
First of all, JavaScript and
Dart are essentially isolated

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.190
from each other on the page.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.150
They can communicate
via the DOM.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.110
They can communicate via
things like post

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:38.110
message on a window.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.500
You can add a handler in Dart,
and you can send messages to

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.364
it from JavaScript,
and vice versa.

00:13:44.364 --> 00:13:49.570
ANTON MUHIN: And ideally
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.970
ideally will prefer if you don't
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.670
same DOM tree from both
Dart and JavaStream

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.800
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.680
pretty complicated and just
[? kernel ?] cases.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.770
So [? new ?] for communicating
between Dart [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.570
you have an I frame or have just
a subtree of DOM, and you

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.340
just communicate with something
like post message

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.225
[? router. ?]

00:14:12.225 --> 00:14:16.400
Just as a model of Dart, we
hope [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.992
to communication
of JavaScript.

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:21.530
SETH LADD: So it sounds like
the recommendation is, use

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.050
post message right now to
communicate between your

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.155
JavaScript code and
your Dart code.

00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:27.450
VIJAY MENON: Yes.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.300
ANTON MUHIN: But you can have
use cases when you want to

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.100
modify the same DOM directory.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.630
Please let us know, because we
are really looking for your

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.280
feedback for your experience,
for your needs.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.720
SETH LADD: So what it sounds
like, it is possible today to

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.420
manipulate the same DOM with
both JavaScript and Dart, but

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.715
that could get you
into trouble?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.430
ANTON MUHIN: It's very unlikely,
but probably yes.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.020
VIJAY MENON: Well, yeah.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.800
You can put Dart scripts and you
can put JavaScript scripts

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.820
on the same page.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.310
They can both manipulate
the DOM.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:05.250
It's our intent to make that
work perfectly well.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.490
But today, expect to see some
funky behavior, and if you do,

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.940
let us know about it.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.690
And there's certainly still some
technical challenges we

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.370
have to solve there with
essentially garbage

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.480
collection, making sure things
don't leak, get a little

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.050
complicated when you have two
runtimes in the browser.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.330
SETH LADD: It sounds like the
expectation then is once we

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.960
get the kinks ironed out, you
should be able to have both

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.560
scripts operating is it more
or less concurrently?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.490
Are they running
in the separate

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.250
processes or separate threads?

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.590
Or how would you characterize
Dart and

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.220
JavaScript parallel execution?

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.390
ANTON MUHIN: This is just a
common DOM model when you have

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.000
the same stuff running on
the main UI thread.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.580
So you run a JavaScript
for some time.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.270
When you yield, then you run
Dart script for some time, you

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:58.950
yield, and so on.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.770
So nothing will change
dramatically here.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.840
Of course, if you don't use
something like isolates or

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.320
[? workers, ?] stuff which adds
real multithreading into

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.836
both Dart and JavaScript.

00:16:11.836 --> 00:16:14.490
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, they do run
in the same process, and

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.470
that's actually pretty
important to getting

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.920
performance.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.840
That's why Dart is very
different from, say, a

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.140
plug-in, where if you look at
plug-ins-- like, say, the Java

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.850
plug-in or others-- they
typically don't interact that

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.870
tightly with the DOM.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.650
They live in their own window.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:36.360
In order to really write apps
that interact very closely

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.300
with the DOM, you really need
to be running on the same

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.950
process, tightly coupled with
the UI of the browser.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:48.440
And so Dart really sits right
next to v8 in our builds, the

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.525
JavaScript engine.

00:16:51.525 --> 00:16:54.490
SETH LADD: So John asks
a good question.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.970
Can you clarify, do the
individual Dart script tags,

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.731
are they all running on
the same UI thread?

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:03.985
ANTON MUHIN: Yes.

00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.430
But in different isolates.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.475
For each script tag, you have
this on a separate isolate,

00:17:09.475 --> 00:17:12.300
and involve on all those
isolates from [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.956
the main UI thread
of the browser.

00:17:14.956 --> 00:17:17.730
SETH LADD: So if each script is
running in its own isolate,

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.410
does that mean each script then
is required to have a

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.004
main function?

00:17:22.004 --> 00:17:22.839
ANTON MUHIN: Yes.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.804
VIJAY MENON: That's correct.

00:17:24.804 --> 00:17:26.589
SETH LADD: Can you just
spend a minute

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.609
talking about isolates?

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:29.365
This is kind of a new
concept if your

00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:30.440
're JavaScript developer.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.990
What does that mean
each script is

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:35.165
running in an isolate?

00:17:35.165 --> 00:17:37.880
ANTON MUHIN: An isolate is just
a unit concurrency in

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.870
Dart, just unit [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.050
It's roughly a thread
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:46.880
So it's instance of
the [? image ?]

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.580
as a separate heap, so we can
ensure references between

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.360
different [? isolates ?].

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.400
And it executes on its own,
but it doesn't always

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.300
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.720
some [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.900
system thread.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.320
As we talked just a couple of
minutes ago, some isolates are

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.100
multiplexed on the
same thread.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.500
And we'll probably
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.750
support for [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:11.510
and stuff like that.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.290
And to some extent, isolates
are close to current

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.760
JavaScript [? workers ?]

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.000
but they're supposed to
be more lightweight

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.350
but [? workers ?]

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:24.280
should be heavyweight.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.970
We expect isolates to be pretty
much lightweight and

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.580
just roughly [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.940
formalize it.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.690
VIJAY MENON: To follow up on
the green thread point, so

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.550
different script tags run
different in isolates.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.320
Any isolates that can interact
with the DOM all

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.415
run on the UI thread.

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:46.870
They're all multiplexed onto
that same UI thread.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.850
So it is really like a sandbox
unit that in some cases can

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:56.130
run on background threads if
they don't touch the DOM.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.930
And we went with that model
for better security.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.320
We think we can build more
secure apps that way.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.100
Script injection's less of an
issue because Dart scripts,

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.250
even if you inject a Dart script
into a page, you can't

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.280
directly interact with other
Dart scripts that

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.056
you have on the page.

00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:17.080
SETH LADD: Which I think
is a very important

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.070
clarification, right?

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:21.160
So you can potentially have
multiple script tags, each

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.570
loading up a Dart file which
has a main function.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.850
Each one of those is running
in an isolate.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.680
If that Dart script touches or
manipulates the DOM, it will

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.820
run in the same UI thread, but
it's still isolated in the

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.830
sense that one Dart script
doesn't know about the other

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:40.490
Dart script.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.630
Is that true?

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.930
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.170
It's somewhat similar to what
we were just talking about a

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.700
few minutes ago about Dart to
JavaScript communication.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.410
Again, two Dart isolates on the
same page, two Dart script

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.450
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] tags on the
same page, can again

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.070
communicate via post message.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.990
But they can't directly reach
into each other's heap.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.240
SETH LADD: Got it.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.970
How does Dartium know if
a script does or will

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:10.930
manipulate the DOM?

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.980
Do you look through
the API calls as

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:14.230
you compile the script?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.790
ANTON MUHIN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] we
apply a pretty simple rule

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.300
If you have script tag in the
page, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.620
manipulate DOM.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.470
And currently [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.220
API to spawn [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.970
dominated isolates versus
just plain isolates.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.200
So roughly in API with the
special call, we say, I want

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.160
to create a new isolate,
but I want this

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.040
isolate to have DOM access.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.202
Which means that this isolate
will run on plain UI thread.

00:20:46.202 --> 00:20:49.300
Or we say, I want to say it will
spawn in our isolate, and

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.660
I don't care about
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.472
And in this case, you have the
liberty to put it on any

00:20:54.472 --> 00:20:57.370
thread which you find
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.775
convenient for us.

00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:01.520
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.360
The isolate API is definitely
under a lot of

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.180
iteration right now.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.930
Today, the declarative
script tags are run

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.610
on the same UI thread.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.000
You have to programmatically
create isolates that run on

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.030
background threads.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.870
SETH LADD: I see, OK.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.760
And I think that if you're
familiar with Dart has light

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.490
and heavy isolates.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.510
And a heavy isolate, at least
when compiled to JavaScript,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.390
will go to a web worker.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.090
But if you have a heavy isolate
running inside of the

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.955
Dart VM in Dartium, that will
just spawn a separate--

00:21:36.955 --> 00:21:38.400
it doesn't go to web
worker, right?

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.810
It just goes to a heavy isolate
inside the virtual

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.315
machine, I would imagine.

00:21:43.315 --> 00:21:45.310
ANTON MUHIN: Yes.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.330
But once again, that's a very
[? messy ?] topic for us,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:54.150
what's the best way to divide
the space between isolates and

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:59.016
workers, because both has its
benefits, and to some extent,

00:21:59.016 --> 00:22:01.630
both are pretty close
concepts.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:06.110
Once again, if that is
[? good ?] for us, and this is

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.702
the area of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
research.

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:09.340
SETH LADD: OK.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.200
So it sounds like we're
definitely asking the

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.720
developer community, play with
heavy and light isolates, play

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.640
with multiple script tags, and
give us some good use cases

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.536
and feedback on how
all this works.

00:22:19.536 --> 00:22:21.530
ANTON MUHIN: That would
be just awesome.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.150
SETH LADD: OK.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.330
So do I need to do anything
special to activate Dart on my

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.020
pages here?

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.710
Or is just a simple script tag,
is that all it takes?

00:22:33.867 --> 00:22:37.150
VIJAY MENON: So we iterated
on this quite a bit.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:43.130
Part of the trickiness is just
getting it integrated into

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.580
Chrome and WebKit, and
figuring out what

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.850
the right hooks are.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.300
With the binaries that are
released today, you won't have

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.940
to do anything.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.420
If you just have a script with
the type application Dart, it

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.680
will go ahead and run.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.760
Those of you who have built it
in the past few weeks have

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.560
noticed that we changed
this a few times.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.130
We had a function that we were
using from JavaScript to

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.540
bootstrap it.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:08.290
If you look under the hood,
that's still there.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.610
We just have a way of just
invoking that for you, so you

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.500
don't actually have to
put it on your page.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.860
And I'll show you an example
later if have

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.435
some time to demo.

00:23:18.435 --> 00:23:20.790
SETH LADD: Yeah, that's
an excellent segue.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.720
And for everyone joining us,
this is Dartisans Episode Two.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.550
We have special guests
from the Dart team.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.180
Today we've announced that
binaries of Chromium plus Dart

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.480
VM integration will be made
available later today on

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.150
dartlang.org.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.350
And for everyone following along
via the live stream,

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:43.840
please add your questions and
comments to the G+ feed.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.040
We'll be monitoring those, and
we'll ask those questions to

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.320
our panel here.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.510
But yeah, I think
it's fantastic.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.240
Let's see a example.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.600
Can you show us a Dart program
running in Dartium?

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.072
What does that look like?

00:23:57.072 --> 00:23:57.820
VIJAY MENON: OK.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.285
Let me try to share
my copy here.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:08.140
OK, is that showing up?

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.160
SETH LADD: Yeah, looks good.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.190
VIJAY MENON: OK.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.632
So this is Dartium.

00:24:16.632 --> 00:24:21.470
You can tell it's the Mac by
the boundaries and so on.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.260
So as we were saying earlier,
this is the

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.660
development tool right now.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.750
Before I launch into anything,
I just want to emphasize

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.240
what's in red here.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.330
This is technical preview.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.015
Don't use this as your
primary browser.

00:24:34.015 --> 00:24:38.080
It hasn't gone through all the
deep security review that we

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.830
do for, say, production Chrome,
and not even as much

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.070
as, say, the Chromium that you
get from the dev channel.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.960
So this is very preliminary
stuff.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.250
It's great for testing
your Dart apps.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.340
Don't go off, read your mail, go
to news sites, or whatever

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.346
on this, because it hasn't
been secured.

00:24:57.346 --> 00:25:02.200
So that said, we wanted to do
a few of those things to

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.580
integrate those in there
to help developers.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.840
One is that we wanted the start
page just to emphasize

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.690
this point.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.650
This is the home page
when you launch.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.260
It will give you information
on Dartium.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.550
So let's get to the
meat of it.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.270
As we said, the interesting
thing here is being able to

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.000
run Dart applications.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.100
And here's a very simple example
of a Dart app, a

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.660
test.html that I've got here
that's just got a script, an

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.900
application Dart script,
in my bin.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:34.840
Its importing the HTML library,
and it's basically

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.625
running hello from Dart
and adding that to

00:25:37.625 --> 00:25:39.250
the body of the document.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.420
And you can see that
running here.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.690
So again, this is pretty
short and sweet.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:45.690
Nothing really to it.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.670
It's creating an element,
adding it to the body.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.510
There's nothing that you
need to bootstrap it.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.230
Just you will see the
application Dart, and as we

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.430
reload it, it's there.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:58.690
We can also run larger apps.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.660
This is a test version
of Swarm.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:05.600
It's a newsreader that
we've demoed before.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.610
This is really what's
just in the source.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.940
It's not showing any articles.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:15.060
But this is all running
in the Dart runtime.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.860
If you've seen it demoed
before, you've seen it

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.440
compiled to JavaScript.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.770
So we think cool things about it
when you run it in the Dart

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:28.310
VM, is that you get
the console here.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.630
You can look at all
of the scripts.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:35.780
So this is an application that
has some 60 Dart files to it.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:38.650
They all just show up in
the dev tools thing.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.165
As you make changes, you can
just reload it, and it will

00:26:41.165 --> 00:26:42.410
just reload it in the browser.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.690
So we really think that'll
be cool for

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.200
the development cycle.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.150
And this stuff just started
coming up in

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.640
the past couple weeks.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.820
Pavel, one of our colleagues in
Saint Petersburg, has just

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.680
added a lot of support
for dev tools.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.670
Here I've set a break point
on the onload thing.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.000
So if I go ahead and
I reload the page,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.240
you can see it break.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.850
Let's see.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.310
He's just changing
what you can see.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:15.620
So again, much incentive
to keep updating this.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:20.110
You'll see more and more
cool stuff here.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.560
ANTON MUHIN: Tomorrow, the day
after tomorrow, we should be

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.550
able to inspect your frames.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:28.050
So it will be closer to full
fledged [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.920
VIJAY MENON: Right.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.220
So here you can see, you can
already set break points and

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.360
continue on from there.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:39.240
So I think this will be pretty
cool to use for writing large

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.210
Dart applications.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.480
Even if you intend to compile
it to JavaScript, this is a

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.203
very nice way of developing.

00:27:45.203 --> 00:27:47.910
And you get the native
Dart runtime support.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.020
We really like the dev
experience, and that's the

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.021
feedback we've gotten
to there.

00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:56.200
SETH LADD: That's a
good point, Vijay.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.600
To reiterate, I think if
anything, Dartium just really

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.300
makes an awesome
dev experience.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.570
You can think of, you're coding
in the editor, you're

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.940
getting syntax highlighting,
you're getting code

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.200
completion.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.340
And you can run that Dart code
straight inside Dartium.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.560
Zero compilation step, there.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.270
Test your app.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.360
And then when you go to
production, you can compile to

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.490
JavaScript and hit every
major browser.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.320
So if anything, Dartium enables
us to move just as

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.140
fast as other web developers
with no compilation.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.435
I think that's just fantastic.

00:28:29.435 --> 00:28:31.520
ANTON MUHIN: And [? develop ?]
feature we expect to be

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.260
implemented pretty soon.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.760
Something like in a couple of
weeks, so we want to have

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.510
better integration between
Dart editor and Dartium.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.200
So you will be able to debug the
code in Dartium from your

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.940
Dart editor [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.745
So we hope that it will
help you as well.

00:28:49.745 --> 00:28:51.190
SETH LADD: That's an
excellent point.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.896
I'm looking forward to that.

00:28:52.896 --> 00:28:55.120
VIJAY MENON: And one other thing
I want to show up here.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.880
You'll notice this Dart
tool tip here.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.220
The icon's probably a little
hard to see over there.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.540
We've integrated this kind of
playground here that we found

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.710
really useful for testing
out stuff.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.380
This is sort of analogous to the
Dartboard app if you used

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.740
it on Dartlang, except it's
actually just running locally.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.190
There's no server
involved here.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:16.100
It's just running.

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.210
And of course, it's also running
on the VM, so it gives

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:22.330
you a chance to see what
works on the VM, what

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.980
doesn't work on the VM.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.040
As you find problems with APIs
or stuff like that, this is

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.720
also a great way to test
something out, send us an

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.990
email saying, hey, I tried this
in the playground and it

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.880
didn't work.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.860
So basically, this is
stuff you can go

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.136
ahead and edit here.

00:29:38.136 --> 00:29:44.410
"Hello from Dart today." And it
just goes ahead and runs.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.680
And you can play around
with that.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.355
The other thing here is that you
can look at the console,

00:29:50.355 --> 00:29:52.130
and you can get error
messages.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.420
So print also just prints
the console.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.120
It's like console.log, for
those of you who are

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.195
familiar with that.

00:29:58.195 --> 00:30:00.000
Let me see if I can go
ahead and open that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.320
You can see that, open the dev
tools console to see this just

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.790
printed out, when we went
and clicked on run.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.740
Let me try that more time,
you'll see the message appear

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.230
one more time.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.240
So again, it's a really easy
way, even if you're not really

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.030
interested in the browser, you
just want to play around with

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.770
what can VM do, what are the
semantics of this or that,

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:18.620
play around with the language.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.000
The playground is really
handy for that.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.450
And error messages
will improve.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:29.020
But here, let me just take
out this quote here.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.980
So I've got a badly formed
program, and you see the error

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.160
message here.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:40.200
Unterminated string literal,
line 3, position 43.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.130
Again, that can be improved, but
you get the messages that

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.640
can really help you see
what's going on.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.400
And as you load your Dart apps
to- if you have a syntax

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.580
error, just open the console.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.940
You'll see the errors
from the VM show

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.190
up here on the console.

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:00.080
SETH LADD: That is so cool.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.920
VIJAY MENON: I can go
ahead and fix that.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.530
We'll see that running again.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:08.780
OK.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:16.930
So anything else you want
to show, Anton?

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.940
ANTON MUHIN: Probably not.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.150
VIJAY MENON: I'll just
add one thing Anton

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:25.980
actually just added in.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:26.970
Let's see if this works.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.880
ANTON MUHIN: I think it's
Chrome version.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.580
VIJAY MENON: I think I actually
went to this thing.

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.360
But yeah, another thing is you
can see the version of the

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.780
Dart VM that's integrated here
now, as well, along with

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.090
everything else.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.190
As you do report issues or run
into issues, please let us

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:46.000
know what version number you've
got, and that will help

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.254
us reproduce things
and fix stuff.

00:31:51.254 --> 00:31:55.487
SETH LADD: It would be very cool
if in the console, you

00:31:55.487 --> 00:31:57.796
could have "report this bug."

00:31:57.796 --> 00:32:00.610
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:01.180
Yeah.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.630
We've talked about that.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.810
Especially with the playground,
it's just such a

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.990
nice way of writing test cases
that are small, and say, yeah,

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.320
this API doesn't work.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.560
Seth, you've been following a
lot of bugs lately in the past

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.680
week, so you know it's a nice-

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.340
SETH LADD: I don't
call them bugs.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:16.135
I call them opportunities.

00:32:16.135 --> 00:32:17.470
VIJAY MENON: Opportunities.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.830
You've been sharing many
opportunities with us, with

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.670
the team recently.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.686
So, yes.

00:32:24.686 --> 00:32:27.720
SETH LADD: I have a couple
questions about how this fits

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.560
into the other features of
the Dart virtual machine.

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.130
For one, Dart can run in two
different execution modes,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.660
production and checked.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.890
Production mode will run with
the type assertions turned

00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.770
off, and check mode will turn
on those type assertions.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.870
Oftentimes, check mode is very
useful during the debugging

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.650
cycle and the authoring cycle.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.120
How do I toggle between
these two

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.200
different modes in Dartium?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.440
VIJAY MENON: You want to
take that one, Anton?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.290
ANTON MUHIN: OK, if
you don't mind.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.880
So for now, it's not
very convenient.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.440
For now, we have to provide
a special--

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.320
when you start Dartium, you only
provide [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.970
just environment variable
which [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.350
flags and enables
checkit mode.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.770
For example, enable
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.660
We are going to open that, and
eventually want to expose

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.270
somewhat APIs so that we can
control this setting in more

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.610
convenient way.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:35.840
And we hope to publish a tiny
article, just maybe a page,

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.490
maybe even less, how to enable
those [? checks ?]

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.168
later when Dartium release
will go official.

00:33:43.168 --> 00:33:44.100
SETH LADD: Right.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.790
We will publish those
when we publish the

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.000
how to download Dartium.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.180
So we'll include the instruction
how to flip

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.380
between these two modes.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:56.300
Do you think we'll eventually
put those into about:flags?

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.690
ANTON MUHIN: Maybe, maybe just.
We definitely have one

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.670
option we have discussing
something like that.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:08.179
You can switch this mode on
directly from the Dart.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.489
So something like you start the
Dart application, and you

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:13.190
say, on check mode, something
like that.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.659
We are really discussing
it these days.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:19.154
It's another thing
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:19.154 --> 00:34:20.630
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, we definitely
want to make it

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.650
easy to run check mode.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.340
By default, it's off, as
you can see if this

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.210
example is still up.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.199
I just said, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
message equals a string here,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:33.010
and you can see it's still
running just fine here, and

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:33.949
printing it out.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:36.570
That's because we're running
in production mode.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.230
If you do run it in check
notice, as Anton said--

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.350
today you have to use a set
environment flag to do that--

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.690
then you would see an error on
the console saying that the

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.730
type check fails.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.190
In check mode, you'd have
a type check on

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.479
that line right there.

00:34:53.479 --> 00:34:57.810
ANTON MUHIN: On the good side,
when we have is planned

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.040
integration with Dart editor,
Dart editor should be able to

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.970
start Dartium for you with all
the flags properly set.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.130
So in development mode, you will
have this check mode for

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.420
free, and you won't have to
default with nested flags,

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.332
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and
stuff like that.

00:35:12.332 --> 00:35:14.260
VIJAY MENON: Yeah, that's a good
reason to use the editor.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:17.700
I think they already have the
support in there to fire off

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.720
in dev mode, and I highly
recommend it for

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.440
development of apps.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.740
It will run slower, but when
you're trying to find bugs,

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:30.500
it's great to have this check
here and catch this.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:31.780
Presumably you put
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.540
message, because you want to
actually convey something.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:42.950
And you will get that
check in check mode.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.500
SETH LADD: So Vijay, you can
flip back to you and

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.340
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.650
Awesome, hi.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.910
So John asks another
good question.

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.410
Another feature of the
Dart ecosystem is

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.070
the support of snapshots.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:01.980
Snapshots allow you to take a
snapshot or kind of a binary

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.840
[? serialization ?]

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.070
of the heap of the
program right

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.760
before it starts executing.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:14.270
This we've seen in our internal
test really speeds up

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.980
initialization of the program.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.320
Is this something that Dartium
supports today, snapshots?

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.734
And if not, what's
the plan there?

00:36:21.734 --> 00:36:24.670
ANTON MUHIN: Oh, yes, we do some
support snapshots, which

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.460
really supports two kinds
of snapshots.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.250
So the first snapshot
allows you--

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.860
once again, in Dart everything
is an isolate.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:36.630
So we have a very fast way to
start an isolate from a

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.400
snapshot, which loads all the
libraries you have to use.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.665
And that gives us a quite
reasonable startup time for

00:36:44.665 --> 00:36:48.770
the application, and still
want to improve upon it.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.570
Dartium supports now an
interesting feature.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.910
It's only partial application
snapshot, which allows you to

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.260
make binary representation of
the application, which it

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.580
starts on top of
the libraries.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.160
And we have experimental support
in Dartium for caching

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.360
of these partial snapshots.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.554
So roughly, if you have a
huge application, you

00:37:10.554 --> 00:37:12.140
would start it once.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.230
Program is able to cache this
binary [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.280
application.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.200
And next time you will open
this Dart application, it

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.330
starts even faster, because
you're starting

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.500
directly from snapshots.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.550
This is an experimental feature,
because it might have

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:25.800
security implications.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.150
We had some interesting
discussions about caching

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.370
policies of this partial
snapshot, because

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:33.990
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.730
normal web case, server can
tell you how long you're

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.890
allowed to cache
this resource.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.920
But [UNINTELLIGIBLE] application
consist many

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:50.150
parts, so we need to devise a
reasonable policy for caching

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.430
partial snapshots.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:53.760
But we really hope to have
something like that

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.130
eventually, because one of our
goals is absolutely blazing

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.345
startup time for your [? old ?]
applications.

00:38:02.345 --> 00:38:06.200
SETH LADD: So this application
snapshot experimental feature,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.890
it sounds like that's actually
here today, and we as

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:12.760
developers will be able
experience this much faster

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.310
startup time on the
second load.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.260
Is that something we should
explicitly test for you and

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.351
send feedback on?

00:38:19.351 --> 00:38:21.420
ANTON MUHIN: If you please.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.450
Right now, in the current build
of Dartium, it will only

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.730
work for you if you reload the
application in the same tab

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.010
due to technical difficulties.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.750
Later, we can expose it,
for example, under the

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.734
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] so we can
switch it on and off to

00:38:37.734 --> 00:38:40.335
experimental test.
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:40.335 --> 00:38:42.160
we will just [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.060
VIJAY MENON: Also today, if
you turn it on, it won't

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.850
interact very well with dev
tools, because of course,

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.520
there's some tricks.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.000
Dev tools likes to work off the
actual scripts, and the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.190
snapshot actually doesn't
need the scripts.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.790
So that bridge will be closed
too, so there's still some

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:05.540
things to clean up there to make
it really easy to use.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:09.540
But yeah, an app like Swarm, I'm
pretty excited to see what

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.140
we do with snapshot.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.430
As we saw, there were like 60
different files that write.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:19.785
So being able to have the
snapshot just cache that in

00:39:19.785 --> 00:39:23.430
the browser and restart from
that I think will be great as

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.940
we deploy these applications.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.340
SETH LADD: I'm really excited
for this feature, actually.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:33.500
I agree improving startup time
has always been an important

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.690
goal of the Dart project, and I
think snapshots are going to

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.620
help tremendously here.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.830
VIJAY MENON: To follow up
Anton's point about there

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.080
being two levels of snapshot.

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.660
So things like dart:dom,
dart:core, dart:html, those

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.340
are all part of a snapshot that
you're getting for free.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.520
So we're actually starting
from the snapshot that's

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.570
already defined all those things
in there, and that's

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.000
why we can have a bigger library
there, which are

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.130
library for Dart and
not pay so much for

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.900
it at startup time.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.480
SETH LADD: So if I write a
random Dart script-- like you

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.440
had the "Hello world"
example there--

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.610
and an imported dart:html.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.890
Does that mean when the Dart
virtual machine inside

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.600
Dartium, loads up your "Hello
world" simple, three-line

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.240
script, it's already
starting from a

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.660
snapshotted version of dart:html?

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.855
ANTON MUHIN: Yes.

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:26.140
SETH LADD: That's pretty
impressive.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.740
Let's take some questions from
the Google+ stream here.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.750
Alan asks, is there an API
into the operating system

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:39.330
environment settings
from within Dart?

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:44.645
And I can't tell if this is
specific to Dartium or not.

00:40:44.645 --> 00:40:47.190
ANTON MUHIN: Exposing API, which
can access operating

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.160
system services from the
browser, sounds like

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.180
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.970
due to various security
considerations.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.140
So we are not aiming to provide
any additional API

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.620
than just a typical browser
already has implemented in

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.750
JavaScript.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.250
But if you're [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
have a use case, maybe the

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.950
better way would be, for
example, to improve on file

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:13.570
API in the browser.

00:41:16.074 --> 00:41:16.970
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.460
I mean, in terms of the
operating system capabilities

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.580
or other environment
capabilities, we're not

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.970
looking to add anything new to
Dart that you can't do in

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.840
JavaScript.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.690
We really want to get
that from HTML5.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.890
HTML5 is starting to add more
and more cool stuff that lets

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.410
you have local storage.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.870
I think particularly for mobile
devices, there's all

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.220
kinds of cool stuff
you can get.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.080
And our goal is to really
expose that in Dart,

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.980
not drill new holes.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.510
You really want to be careful
about providing access to that

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.965
sort of stuff so you can do
it in a very secure way.

00:41:51.965 --> 00:41:53.970
SETH LADD: That's an
excellent point.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:57.110
I think it's important to
reiterate that the Dart inside

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.990
the browser effort, we're
following all the lessons

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:02.260
learned, all the best practices,
all the security

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:08.650
reviews, eventually, that the
JavaScript world has pioneered

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:09.910
for many, many years.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.080
That is, we're operating on the
same types of constraints

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.190
that any other scripting
language, like JavaScript

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.100
inside the browser.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.500
And that's very important
for us to do.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.340
I think to answer Alan's
question, though, from the

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.820
server side, Dart does work
on the server as well.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.640
And nothing we're doing with
the language design or

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.290
libraries paints us into any
kind of corner for just client

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:33.440
side web apps.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.040
So I believe on the server side,
it would be interesting

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.540
to be able to find the system
OS environments.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.490
We already have server side
support for opening socket,

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.910
server side support for reading
files off the native

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.140
operating system file system.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.500
So Dart is definitely being
designed holistically to be an

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.520
end-to-end solution,
server and client.

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.490
But these kind of questions
about operating environment

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:00.420
settings, as Vijay and Anton
mentioned, that would really

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.010
only apply to running on the
command line over on the

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.246
server side.

00:43:04.246 --> 00:43:04.840
VIJAY MENON: Yeah.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.210
One thing that's cool about that
is there'll be libraries

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.720
that will let you access
that on the server.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.580
So I think dart:io, I haven't
played around with it much,

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.460
but that has a lot of the sort
of stuff you'd want on a

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.730
server to access the local
file system and such.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:22.030
And that library will not be
available in the browser,

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:24.700
because we're not going to give
you the ability to just

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.480
go mess around with the
user's file system.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.980
SETH LADD: You're operating in
the same kind of sandbox

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:34.650
security environment that any
other JavaScript file would be

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:38.040
running in, which is
very important.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.760
Mark from the Google+ stream
asks, will Dart eventually be

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.600
submitted for standardization
by a body outside Google, or

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.820
will it continue to be primarily
a Google technology?

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.150
I'm interested in Dart, but
not in learning a Google

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.290
version of VB scripts.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.560
What's our general
philosophy there?

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.340
VIJAY MENON: I don't know
what the timeline for

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.850
that is going to be.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.740
I'm not probably the best
person to answer that.

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.200
You'd probably give as
good of an answer on

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.540
that as I could, Seth.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.640
But I think eventually, sure.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.910
I couldn't really comment
on what the--

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:10.520
SETH LADD: Yeah.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:14.130
I think that eventually
standardization makes a lot of

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.170
sense, especially as we target
Dart for the entire open

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.350
modern web.

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:25.980
But we think it's very early to
talk about that, and right

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:31.360
now we just need to get to a
1.0, get to some sort of a

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.760
shipable production-ready
version.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.200
And I think only then does it
make sense for us to begin the

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.420
standardization process.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.570
I do want to be clear about this
comparison of VB script.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.190
I don't think that's
entirely very fair.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:52.390
Dart has been open source ever
since our initial technology

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:54.210
preview launch back
in October.

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:58.080
And it has always been
compilable to JavaScript, and

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.150
it will always be compilable
to JavaScript.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.560
And so, Dart is very much
aimed, since day one,

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.190
explicitly at the entire
open modern web.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:14.660
So I think it's a way to
encourage developers from all

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:18.660
different app platforms to
develop and deliver fantastic,

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.510
complex, engaging apps
for modern web.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.680
And to do that, we'll always
have to compile the

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.210
JavaScript.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.290
So I don't think the
comparison of VB

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:28.580
script is very fair.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:31.960
Let's see.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.860
Jay from the Google+ stream
says, regarding check mode,

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.220
has there been any discussion
about using check mode checks

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:39.830
to report code coverage?

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.450
Since all checks happen at
runtime, they don't do any

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.510
good if they're not being hit.

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.745
Reporting number of checks that
are never executed would

00:45:45.745 --> 00:45:49.830
be a great quantitative
testing tool.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.640
ANTON MUHIN: We really hope
that Dart will have

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.550
[? great ?] tools eventually
which will make

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.485
developer life easier.

00:45:57.485 --> 00:45:59.010
And we [? could ?]

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.990
have something [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.570
as well [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.740
which we use currently for
checks, can be used to produce

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.201
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:12.800
I don't think it will come in
just a couple of weeks, but

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.140
eventually we want to provide
the best development

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.390
experience we can.

00:46:19.684 --> 00:46:21.440
SETH LADD: So we have about
10 minutes left.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.740
So if you want to get
your questions in,

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.080
please join to hangout.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.040
There is room here.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.280
Or post to the Google+ stream.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.290
For those who are going to
download Dartium later today

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.860
and start testing this out,
are there any caveats they

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.420
should be aware of other than,
of course, this technology

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.340
preview, and please don't use
it for day-to-day browsing.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.530
But for instance, does it create
its own profile, or

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.160
does it use the existing profile
of their currently

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.410
installed Chrome or Chromium?

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:57.650
VIJAY MENON: You want
to take that, Anton?

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.450
ANTON MUHIN: If you
don't mind.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.775
I think just to say,
once again, Dartium

00:47:01.775 --> 00:47:03.810
is the project preview.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.530
So we would really recommend
you to create a separate

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.260
profile for Dartium, because
you probably don't want

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.760
Dartium to mess up with all
your bookmarks and your

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.300
personal stuff [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:15.870
profiles.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:20.460
So it's just a sanity measure
to keep your regular Chrome,

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.330
if you have Chrome
as your regular

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.580
browser, and Dartium separate.

00:47:27.415 --> 00:47:29.660
VIJAY MENON: If you're running
regular Chrome--

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:31.240
not Chromium, but Chrome--

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.160
alongside Dartium, and Dartium
is the only-- you're not

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.420
running Chromium, it should
just by default have a

00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:38.460
separate profile.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.450
But if you do use Chromium for
some other reason, you have

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.600
two different Chromium
builds, they will

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.013
trample on each other.

00:47:45.013 --> 00:47:48.720
ANTON MUHIN: And we will provide
guidelines in the

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.360
Dartium documentation
how to use a

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.210
separate profile for you.

00:47:54.210 --> 00:47:55.100
SETH LADD: That's right.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.300
We'll include in the
documentation we'll release

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.200
later today how to set up your
own profile directory so you

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.215
don't trample on other existing
compound Chromiums.

00:48:03.215 --> 00:48:05.620
That's why it's usually great
for testing, too.

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.890
You can blow away the specific
profile if you need to start

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:10.635
fresh, and you don't mess
with anything else.

00:48:10.635 --> 00:48:13.780
So, absolutely.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.600
So let's take another question
here from the G+ stream.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.150
Are there any difficulties you
face as a developer when you

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.020
develop Dart because it needs
to compile to JavaScript?

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:25.840
Is there anything that will
become impossible to compile

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.090
the JavaScript?

00:48:29.005 --> 00:48:30.970
VIJAY MENON: That's a really
good question.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:34.080
It's certainly not our intent.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.910
I mean, as Seth said earlier,
compiling the JavaScript is

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:42.120
very, very important and
will be important for

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.370
a long, long time.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:50.090
So Dart, I mean, in my view is
one of the reasons why we have

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:53.680
a new language here, is that we
wanted to create something

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.450
that you could compile pretty
faithfully down to JavaScript,

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.440
but still you gave a better
developer experience.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.750
So I think for the foreseeable
future, I don't see anything

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.425
where you wouldn't be able
to run it on JavaScript.

00:49:07.425 --> 00:49:11.445
I think down the line, you'll
get benefits running natively

00:49:11.445 --> 00:49:15.860
as Dart because you get better
performance, better startup,

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.290
check mode, stronger
checks, and so on.

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:24.420
But your apps should run in
JavaScript, absolutely.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.340
SETH LADD: I should probably
add that through some of my

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.760
experimentation, there are very
corner cases we still

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.540
have to work out to be
totally transparent.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.890
For instance, Dart, its
integers are arbitrary

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:39.360
precision, for instance.

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.090
You can just bang on your
keyboard all day for an

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.540
integer, and Dart will go
ahead and suck that in.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.640
But when you compile that to
JavaScript, JavaScript has

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:48.940
limits on integer precision.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.800
So there is a slight
disconnect there.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.880
There's some open bugs there, if
you're curious about that.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.790
And so, this is why we launch,
I think, in technology

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.650
preview, too, right?

00:49:57.650 --> 00:50:01.150
We want real developers to test
this out, and help us,

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:04.820
first, identify these corner
cases, and then help us

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:07.400
understand what it is that they
want the system to do in

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.460
these kind of cases, as well.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:13.970
But generally, as Vijay said,
the intent is to be able to

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.880
compile to logical, same
performance JavaScript, and

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.885
that's a core tenet of the
language, absolutely.

00:50:20.885 --> 00:50:27.430
ANTON MUHIN: And for example, we
have a huge pile of tests,

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:29.280
and we run both [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.550
Dart VM, Dartium and compile
to JavaScript code.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.990
And we try to minimize the
difference between the results

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.700
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] absolute
possible minimum.

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:43.540
SETH LADD: So as we wrap
up here, what's

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.640
next for you guys?

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.780
What's the next couple weeks or
months look like for you in

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:48.030
the Dart team?

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.230
Vijay?

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:53.890
VIJAY MENON: Sure.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:59.170
Well, we're going to
make things better.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:03.540
Dev tools, you're going to be
seeing big changes there over

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.365
the next few days, actually.

00:51:05.365 --> 00:51:08.390
I think Pavel's got some changes
coming in that will

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.980
help stuff.

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.380
Anton said--

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.090
I talked about snapshotting
as something he's been

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:14.420
working on a lot.

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:17.430
Isolate APIs.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:21.080
Also dart:html is something
under active development as

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:26.780
well, and basically we're
working to make sure you get

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.650
the same experience on both the
JavaScript path and the

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:31.410
Dartium path.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:34.410
But sometimes one runs ahead
of the other, but we're

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.300
actually using a lot of the same
scripts now to generate

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.520
the implementations for both
to keep those things

00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.530
consistent.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:44.000
So a lot of improvement
on APIs, a lot of

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.840
improvements on dev tools.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.540
We're doing a lot of performance
testing right now.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.510
We just really started
on that.

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:58.730
So a lot of things that Anton
alluded to the very beginning.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.380
He did a lot of work on v8,
which is a fantastic

00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:01.940
experience.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.640
He knows where a lot of
the problem areas are.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.780
But we're just starting
to benchmark,

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.310
hammering on the DOM.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:13.190
And we got a ways to go there,
but we fully intend to make

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:20.760
that very fast and yet
consistent between Dartium and

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:24.910
compilation to JavaScript
as well.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:26.700
SETH LADD: Anton, anything
to add there?

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.700
What's next for you with Dart?

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:33.520
ANTON MUHIN: Just one
important thing.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.310
We are not complete on the API
implementation because in some

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:41.140
cases we had to take shortcuts
just because we don't have

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:42.280
enough hands.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.330
We are going to improve
our [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:49.850
APIs, especially some
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:51.294
APIs.

00:52:51.294 --> 00:52:54.860
And that would be a constant
goal for us, I think, at least

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:58.220
for a couple of months
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.240
SETH LADD: I think you bring
up an excellent point.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.350
A lot of Dart isn't done yet.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:03.840
We're still in technology
preview.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.920
So the main ask for our
developers out there is please

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:09.680
do try all these different
aspects of the Dart platform.

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.750
The editor, the language, the
libraries, the virtual

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:15.710
machine, the JavaScript
compiler, and now Dartium.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.310
And please do join the mailing
list. Please do file new

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:21.300
issues, dartbug.com.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.380
We definitely listen to
all this feedback.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:27.000
Our team is very well-engaged
and listening to

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.700
what's going on.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:31.110
So please do try it all
out, and let us know.

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:33.580
And it looks like one more
question, because I know this

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.070
comes up a lot, from John.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:38.390
So reflection, our mirror-based
reflection API.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.010
Do we have any ideas?

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:43.820
Is this weeks, or months,
or years away?

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:49.370
VIJAY MENON: I don't know,
actually, to be honest. Not

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:54.180
weeks, but I know it's being
actively worked on.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:57.295
I don't know what the timeline
for that coming out is.

00:53:57.295 --> 00:53:59.860
SETH LADD: Yeah, I get the sense
that this is a large

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.240
implementation effort than maybe
some other, just like,

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.380
pure library features.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.290
And so I do know that it's very,
very close on the radar,

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.290
and there's active discussion
to work on it.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:12.810
But yeah, we're not exactly
sure what any kind

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:13.770
of timeline is there.

00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:18.240
But definitely we'll be
delivering a mirror-based API

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.880
at some point for us
to experiment with.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.150
Well, I want to thank everybody
for joining us for

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.210
Episode Two of Dartisans.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:29.770
We hope to continue these with
your support, so please do

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:31.460
leave some comments on
what worked and what

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:33.330
didn't on our G+ stream.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.050
And as always, join our mailing
list at dartlang.org

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.700
and let us know what's working
for you and what you'd like to

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:42.330
see from the Dart platform.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.650
So on behalf of the whole Dart
team, I want to say thank you

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:45.330
to everyone.

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.430
And Vijay and Anton, thank you
very much for being our

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.730
guests, and congrats on getting
Dartium released.

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.550
That is big, and we'll open that
up for downloads, if all

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.432
goes well, later today.

00:54:57.432 --> 00:54:59.156
VIJAY MENON: Thanks, Seth.

00:54:59.156 --> 00:55:00.235

SETH LADD: All right.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.400
Thanks, everyone.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.030
