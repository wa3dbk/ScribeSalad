00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.769
&gt;&gt; TORI: I am Andraz Tori, Co-Founder and
CTO at Zemanta. I've been coding since I was

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.020
10 but always did other stuff too including
being a TV host on National Television in

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.720
Slovenia. Naturally, the show was about consumer
electronics. Zemanta is a Slovenian company

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:30.490
trying to change how text is being written
on the web, worldwide. We want to make text

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.160
editor smart, making them understand what
people are writing so that editors can help

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.620
us with additional images, links, text, and
maybe someday even fact checking.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.760
&gt;&gt; What is your extension about?
&gt;&gt; TORI: Our extension makes text editors

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.210
of all major blogging platforms better and
more interesting. When the extension sees

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.129
that you're trying to write a blog post, it
extends the editor with additional functionality,

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.670
suggesting images, related articles, links,
and text you can include in your post.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.690
&gt;&gt; What are the challenges and benefits of
embedding your UI on another site?

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.110
&gt;&gt; TORI: It's really hard to maintain an extension
that integrates with UIs of various blogging

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.090
tools keeping compatibility with over 10 rich
text editors. In exchange for that effort

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.530
on our site, the user gets seamless integration
without needing to invoke any special comment,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.770
site, or menu. Zemanta just works and that's
how software should be. Chrome makes life

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.140
for this kind of extensions easier since the
extension API is built on the paradigm that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.720
extensions want to modify web pages and not
just sit on the side. Generally, we'd like

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.110
to see more web standards that would make
extensions like ours easier. For example,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.340
a standard way to extend a rich text editor
on the web would be nice.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.409
&gt;&gt; What got you interested in Google Chrome
extensions?

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.229
&gt;&gt; TORI: Our existing base of users was migrating
to Chrome. So we naturally had to follow them.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.450
Our first Chrome extension was developed as
an internal company hack day project, in a

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.660
single day. The first time we tried developing
an extension was in September '09. The documentation

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.169
was very sparse. We were wondering in the
dark, but the open source nature of Chrome,

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:33.470
allowed us to create a functioning prototype.
The second time around, it was one day before

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.920
the general availability of extensions in
the beta channel. Luckily, with development

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.320
based in Slovenia and due to the time zone
difference, we were able to get from prototype

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.949
to final extension while people here in the
U.S. were sleeping and we had it ready by

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.540
morning U.S. time.
&gt;&gt; How did your vision evolve as you were

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.350
working on your extension?
&gt;&gt; TORI: We had to make a few compromises

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.810
to our extension because of our specific needs.
A couple of things come to mind. We could

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.470
expose only one function from extension to
the widget. We preferred to be able to expose

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:18.040
many of them so we had to reengineer the approach.
We used window.name hack for making cross-domain

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:26.040
POST calls. We'd prefer using something non-hackish.
Also based on our users' feedback, we changed

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.750
the browser action menu to page action with
our second release. Toolbar space is precious,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.440
and your extension really has to be used all
the time to earn a permanent space there.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.040
&gt;&gt; What did you enjoy the most about writing
your extension?

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.840
&gt;&gt; TORI: The thing we enjoyed the most was
that the extension is very much like creating

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:52.230
a webpage and the compactness of the API is
also great. You can include any JavaScript

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.259
library you need and don't need to reinvent
the wheel. The web-like environment also makes

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:03.479
it easy to include more people in development
without having them to all learn a new environment

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:11.220
immediately, even though, it's easy. Also
restarting a browser is a web version of compiling.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.140
Not being forced to do so speeds up development
immensely.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.430
&gt;&gt; What were some challenges you faced when
writing your extension?

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.880
&gt;&gt; TORI: Our biggest problem was and still
is that our homepage widget needs to communicate

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.370
with our extension. But for security reasons,
there is no support for that from the extensions

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.620
framework. We found a hack that works for
now, but we're still looking for a better

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.260
way to solve this. Chrome is being developed
for many different operating systems but not

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.080
with the same speed. So in the early days,
it could happen that features described in

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.280
the documentation didn't work everywhere or
at least not as described. This stopped being

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.490
a problem after we realized this and started
to expect it. Lately, we don't see it anymore.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.660
&gt;&gt; Was there a particular technical challenge
you faced in which you gave an innovative

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.450
solution?
&gt;&gt; TORI: We are proud of what we did but at

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.530
the same time we are building on knowledge
freely shared within the web community. Hence,

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:21.030
it feels odd to take credits for it. For example,
our widget needs two things, an API key from

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.630
our extension and the ability to communicate
with our servers. We achieved the first by

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.831
using a hack by Aaron Boodman and the second
by piggybacking on window.name as first described

00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:39.900
by Chris Zipp. We still had to write a bunch
of our code and I think we did a good job.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.670
But glorious contribution wasn't really ours.
&gt;&gt; What do you think about Google Chrome's

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.480
decision to use CSS, HTML and JavaScript as
the basis of its extension framework?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.840
&gt;&gt; TORI: Using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to
a variety of extensions lowers the barrier

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.400
to entry significantly. Existing skills can
be used and even some code can be shared between

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.080
browsers. There is no need to hire external
specialized developers since companies can

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.630
use a lot of internal expertise in standard
web technologies.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.060
&gt;&gt; What advice can you give someone before
starting to work on a Google Chrome extension?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.840
&gt;&gt; TORI: To start working on a Chrome extension,
read the documentation first. Not scan it.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.610
Really read it since it's really concise.
It's highly likely that your answer is already

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.759
there. You will waste a lot of time, like
we did, if you don't follow this simple advice.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.050
&gt;&gt; Were you able to share code with the other
browser extensions you released?

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.410
&gt;&gt; TORI: We tried to share as much code as
possible between Chrome, Firefox, and Internet

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.660
Explorer extensions. And even with server
site platforms like WordPress, Joomla, Movable

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.940
Type, and Drupal. Over the years, we noticed
that browsers are becoming more and more compatible

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:03.169
with each other. Unfortunately, we are still
far from having full cross-browser extensions.

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.200
But one can dream.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.000
IO conference.
