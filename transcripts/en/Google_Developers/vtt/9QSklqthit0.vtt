PETE LEPAGE: Hey, everybody, and
welcome to another edition

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.010
of the Chrome Apps
Office Hours.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.600
Today we're joined by Joe
Marini, who's going to be

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.610
joining us in our Mountain
View office.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.550
Special thanks to Louis Gray
and to Peter Lubbers for

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.070
helping us get this set up.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.660
Normally we broadcast out here
in New York City and have

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.364
people join from London, but we
decided to switch things up

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:34.480
a little bit today.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.410
If you're joining us for the
first time, and want to talk

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.790
about this, be sure to add the
Chrome Apps hashtag to any of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.790
your comments or any of the
stuff that you want to talk

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.400
about online.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.780
Joe is going to be talking with
the Media Galleries API.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.610
The Media Galleries API is
pretty slick in that it lets

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.690
you get access to all of the
videos, the pictures, and the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.500
music that's sitting on your
computer, just like you would

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.350
be able to do with any
other native app.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.010
We wanted to make sure that
Chrome Apps had this

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.070
capability.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.300
So with that, I'll pass it over
to Joe who's going to

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.970
start talking about the new
Media Galleries API.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.500
JOE MARINI: All right,
thanks, Pete.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.920
Hello, everyone.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.690
Hello, developers.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.740
Thanks for joining us.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.910
I am Joe Marini.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.830
I'm a developer advocate here
at Google and Chrome Apps is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.650
one of the things I focus on.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130
As Pete mentioned, I'm going to
be talking about the Media

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.530
Galleries API.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.390
If you want to follow along with
us, there's a GitHub repo

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.500
I'll show in a moment.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.100
There's also the documentation
available online at

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.510
developer.chrome.com/apps.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.570
And in fact, that's the window
I'm showing right now.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.120
So this is the API I will
be talking about.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.270
And as Pete mentioned, the
Media Galleries API is

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.900
essentially intended to provide
access to the media

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.170
that the user has stored on
their device-- their pictures,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.760
their music, their movies,
and so on.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.310
And this API gives you access
to that via Chrome Apps.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920
So it's a pretty simple API.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.130
There's really only one function
you have to worry

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.780
about, and it's this
one right here.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.160
It's called get media
file systems.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.970
This function takes an object
that describes the kind of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.880
media you're trying to access
and then a callback function

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.970
which will be called back with
the file systems representing

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.060
the various kinds of media
on the user's system.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.450
So that's the documentation if
you want to read through it.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.330
I prefer to actually
work in live code.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.150
So let's go over to the code and
take a look at how this is

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.050
actually written.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.360
Well, actually before
I do that let me--

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.000
PETE LEPAGE: Actually,
Joe, can I ask

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.830
a real quick question?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.090
JOE MARINI: Sure.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.540
PETE LEPAGE: What's the
difference between using the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.620
Media Galleries API and actually
going and using like

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
the HTML5 file system to go
access a picture that the user

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.460
has on their system?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.830
Why would I use one
or the other?

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.000
JOE MARINI: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.680
Actually, they're
complementary.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.300
The callback that I just
mentioned that the media file

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.730
systems comes back
with gives you an

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.480
HTML5 file system object.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.310
Well, actually, it's an array
of these objects.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.750
Each one of them represents the
different media systems on

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.790
the user's computer.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.960
The main difference is that the
media system that you get

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.820
back only contains the media
types that the Chrome Apps

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.800
platform supports on
the user's device.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.600
So you don't have to worry about
parsing through files

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.590
that the system can't play back
or anything like that.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.240
So think of it as a convenience
way of getting at

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.090
the locations on the user's
device of where

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.840
the media is stored.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.610
The system worries about where
those things are located.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.270
You don't have to go traipsing
through the user's device

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.090
using the file system API.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.550
It just makes things
a lot easier.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.040
But the objects that
you get are

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.170
actual file system objects.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.230
So it's a nice little
convenience thing.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.850
PETE LEPAGE: And I think the
other important thing to call

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.870
out there is that the HTML5
file system API gives you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.750
access to a small sort of
sandbox portion of the user's

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.110
hard drive.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.390
It doesn't give you like full
access to the user's hard

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.530
drive, right?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.160
JOE MARINI: Unless you
specifically ask for the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
user's permission.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.900
If you're OK with throwing up
an open dialogue or a save

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.575
dialogue, then fine, you
can go write files to

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:54.770
your heart's content.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.030
But yes, this actually gives you
access to an entire folder

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.230
with the user's permission.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.740
So it's a nice convenience
feature.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.180
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.490
JOE MARINI: Yeah.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.290
And in fact, the sample I'm
going to be showing is in our

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.380
Google Chrome GitHub repo.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.060
And I'm showing that on
the screen right now.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.015
So if you go to github.com/googl

00:04:12.015 --> 00:04:17.769
echrome/chromeappsamples, and
you scroll down to the Media

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.735
Gallery folder right here,
that's the code I'm going to

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:20.240
be working in.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.680
So if you want to follow along
with me on your own

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.210
machine, feel free.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.530
Quickly, let me show you what
the app looks like.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.290
I'm going to jump over
here to Chrome.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.900
This is the Canary build,
by the way.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.160
And I'm just going to launch
this app right here.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.980
And this is the Media
Gallery Explorer.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.060
This is the sample that's in
that repo that I'm going to be

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.990
talking about.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.320
So let me just quickly show
you how it works.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.780
You can see the UI, I've got
three buttons up here.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.100
I've got a couple different
places in the UI that show the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.660
various media information.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.820
So I'm just going to click on
the Get Galleries Info button.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.750
And you can see that right here
in this little div it

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.240
says gallery count three--

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.900
music, pictures, and movies.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.310
Now it didn't ask me for
permission because I've

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.140
already run this app on my
machine before and I

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.870
specifically granted this
application permission to go

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.100
get those galleries.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.240
If I want to explicitly ask for
permission or for the user

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.580
to choose galleries,
I can do that too.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.100
So the Select Galleries button
here brings up the UI that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.170
allows the user to specify
which galleries

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.170
I have access to.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.400
So I can go ahead and turn
off movies, for example.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.470
Or if I want to add another
folder, I can click the Add

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.320
button and then add other
folders to the default system

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.400
folders for Media Galleries.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.550
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, cool.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.630
JOE MARINI: Yeah, it's
pretty neat.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.350
So when I click the Grant
Permissions, now you'll see

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:31.300
that that div has changed.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.000
Now I only have access to the
music and pictures folder.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.420
So I'm going to go ahead and
click the Scan Galleries

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.940
button now.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.900
And when I click Scan Galleries,
you see on the

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.850
left-hand side of the screen
there in this div, I've got

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.900
the contents my music and my
pictures folder showing up.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.140
And I'll just click on one
of these pictures.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.330
This is a photo that I took on
the rooftop of the Google San

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.250
Francisco offices.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.040
You can see that here's
our roof deck.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.210
And it was a pretty nice day.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.990
And I'm just going to
scroll over, and

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.500
there's the Bay Bridge.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.530
So I can go ahead and just
take a look through these

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.790
various pictures.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.945
And you can see that the picture
content is being read

00:06:05.945 --> 00:06:08.280
in and displayed in the div
there on the right.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.660
I could do the same
thing with music.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.690
If I click on a music file,
you'll see that I get a music

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.420
player control in the user
interface there.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.880
So this is the sample that
I'm going to be talking

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.780
about in the code.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.210
So let's jump over
to the code.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.050
And I'm using Sublime Text here,
but you can use whatever

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.750
code editor you're
happy with it.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.210
So let's start off by
taking a look at the

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.100
manifest.json file.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.100
This is the file that determines
what permissions

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.750
the application has and so on.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.230
And right here on line seven--

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.650
this is the one you need
to pay attention to--

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.210
I'm asking for permission to
the Media Galleries API.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.460
And I'm requesting read
access, and I'm also

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.170
requesting that the system
auto-detects where the media

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.090
galleries are.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.410
So when I call this, the system
will say, well, sure,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.430
I'll tell you where they are to
begin with and if the user

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.520
wants to add more, they
can add more.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.850
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.720
So that means, on a PC or on a
Mac, you're always going to

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.690
get the right path.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.895
You don't have to worry
about, hey, where

00:07:03.895 --> 00:07:05.420
is this file located?

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.590
Is it in like /users?

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.220
JOE MARINI: Exactly.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.130
You don't have to memorize what
the default paths on the

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.340
different platforms are.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.390
It just tells you.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.940
PETE LEPAGE: And if it changes,
you don't have to

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.380
deal with it either.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.990
JOE MARINI: Exactly.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.970
If the user decides to change
the locations, again, the

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.650
system makes that transparent.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.740
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.440
So that's the manifest.json
file.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.780
Let's run over to what I call
the runtime.js file.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.230
This is basically the
background page.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.080
This controls the way the
application is launched.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.680
A couple of things
I'm doing here.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.720
First, I'm handling the
onLaunched event right here.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.690
I've got an addListener
for onLaunched.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.990
And what I'm doing is creating
the window, and then inside

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.110
that window I'm setting a
global variable called

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.700
mgabrestart.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.930
And the reason I'm doing this
is because I was playing

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.740
around with the API for when
apps are launched as opposed

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.870
to being restarted.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.770
And I wanted to see if I
could just make the app

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.490
automatically read the gallery
as if it was restarted versus

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:01.980
being just initially launched.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.780
So over down in the onRestarted
event, I have the

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.720
same kind of code where I create
the window, but I set

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.580
that variable to true to
indicate that the app was

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.320
restarted instead of launched.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.350
That's all this does.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.070
This is typical background
page for a Chrome App.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.040
The HTML files, also pretty
straightforward, just got some

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.840
buttons that control the UI.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.590
I've got some divs that
contain the content.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.640
I have the script tag right
here that includes my code

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.790
that actually runs the
application, and that's

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.990
media-gallery.js.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.809
So let's jump over to that file
because this is where the

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:34.770
meat of the code is.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.959
And I'm going to scroll all the
way down to the bottom.

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.690
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, Joe, if it's
possible, could you bump

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:39.205
up your text?

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:40.614
We've got some people on
YouTube asking you

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:41.380
to bump that up.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.659
JOE MARINI: Oh, sure, yes.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.370
I will be happy to
bump the text up.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.300
Hang on one second.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.830
Let's go ahead and make
the font size.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.350
There we go out.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.600
That should be easier to read.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.810
Hopefully, that's better.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.930
I got a nice full screen
of code there.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.910
All right, so here in my
window.addEventListener for

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.710
the loading event, I'm
setting up the UI.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:13.080
I've got some addEventListener
calls on the various buttons.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.540
And then down here, I'm
listening for the change event

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.640
on that select [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.860
that's on the left-hand
side there.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.930
So whenever the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.660
changes in the media gallery
content of the list, I have an

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.610
event that fires, and then
I update the selection.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.670
And this is where I read the
picture, read the audio,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.460
whatever it is.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.510
So let's actually take a
look at how this works.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.930
Right up here on line
240, this is

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.760
where the magic happens.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.140
You can see right here that if
the app was restarted, I call

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.640
the getMediaFileSystems API.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.490
This is the restart case.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.330
For the launched case, I
actually wait for the Scan

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:50.480
Galleries button
to be clicked.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.540
But it does the same thing, it
calls getMediaFileSystems.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.220
And it takes that little options
object right there.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.940
The property I'm passing in
is called interactive.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.510
And it says if_needed.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.750
Now I can pass in if_needed,
which means if the user hasn't

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.720
already granted permission,
it will be prompted to

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.490
the user to do so.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.860
However, if the user has already
granted permissions,

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.320
that dialog doesn't show up.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.280
I could also pass in
yes, which will

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.170
always show the dialog.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.320
Or I can pass in no, which means
don't show the dialog if

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.660
you don't have to.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:26.360
So the getMediaFileSystems
API call takes

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.920
that options object.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.000
And here is the callback
function.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.970
It's called getGalleriesInfo.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.230
So let's go ahead and
scroll up to the

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.580
getGalleriesInfo function.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.470
That's right here.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.040
The first thing I'm going
to do is clear out

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.990
that content div.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.570
That's the div on the right-hand
side that shows the

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.560
pictures, the music,
and so on.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.860
And then, when this function
is called, this parameter

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.030
right here, the results
parameter, that's going to be

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.390
an array of HTML5 file system
objects representing the

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.750
various media galleries.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.360
So the folder for pictures,
the folder for

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.770
music, and so on.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.980
PETE LEPAGE: So logically, you
should get three back, and

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.950
then I would just [? zoom ?]
within each of the folders.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:03.700
Oh, cool

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.620
JOE MARINI: Yeah, three, two,
however many you requested,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:08.020
however many the user
granted access to.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.070
So I'm checking here to see if
the length of that results

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.400
array is greater than zero,
because then I've

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.420
got stuff to process.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.610
And then I'm just using this
forEach loop right here with

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:23.330
this callback function to go
over each one of the gallery

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.150
pieces of information
that comes back.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.080
Now the gallery information
comes back as a JSON string.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.090
And it gives you an ID
for the gallery and

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.370
it gives you a name.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:34.250
The name is a human-readable
string like music, or

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.130
pictures, or whatever it is
localized to your system.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.480
The ID is a tag that you can use
to uniquely identify the

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.060
media gallery that you're
working with.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.260
So you can save that aside and
use it to go back and get

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.290
files at a later date
or whatever.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.050
So that's what I'm using
that there for.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.300
So I loop over each one of these
IDs so that I know how

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.980
many galleries I'm
dealing with.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.870
And I store those in this global
variable right here

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.280
that holds all the different
pieces of arrays.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.520
And then that's how I get the
information about what

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.450
galleries are on the system.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.950
Now the Scan Galleries button
fires off of this function

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.630
right here called
scanGalleries.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.970
And again, it takes
an argument for a

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.390
particular file system.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.010
So what's going to happen is
it's going to loop over each

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.680
one of those array elements
for however many

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.220
galleries I got back.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.500
And each time it's going to do
that, it's going to call this

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.450
addGallery function.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.370
So I parse in the name
object for the

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.220
particular file system.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.810
Again, that's an ID and
a human-readable name.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.230
And then I'm going to call
this addGallery function,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.330
which goes through each gallery
and enumerates all the

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.430
different file objects
that are in there.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.900
And so what I do is I create
a new object called a

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.730
GalleryData.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.020
And you can see that
in my code later.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.330
That's just a little JavaScript
object I have to

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.870
keep track of the various file
names, and sizes of files, and

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.580
different things the
app needs to do.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.120
And then I call the createReader
function.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.240
Now this is a part of the
HTML5 file system API.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.060
Remember, earlier, I said that
they're complimentary.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.160
So you get a file system object
and then you use the

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.090
file system APIs on that
gallery object

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.340
to do the file reading.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.890
So I create the reader.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.970
And then on the reader I
call the readEntries.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:21.430
Again, more HTML5 file system
standard stuff.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.550
I have a function here
called scanGallery.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.150
That's the callback that's going
to get called by the

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.750
file system to read
the actual folder.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.000
And that's up here, so
I'll scroll up to

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.020
the scanGallery function.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.950
So the scanGallery function is
going to get a whole bunch of

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.800
file system entries.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.370
These are the individual file
entries for each particular

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.440
file inside that gallery.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.570
So I'm going see if the length
of the entries array is zero.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.240
And when that happens, the
file system API is done

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.120
calling this callback.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.020
It's processed all
the elements in

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.590
that particular folder.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:57.040
And the reason that I need to do
this is because the way the

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.670
file system works, especially
in the async version, this

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.250
function is going to get called
over and over again,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.310
because it may not get called
with all of the entries in a

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.590
particular folder the
very first time.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.070
The system is just going to
keep calling this function

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.620
until there's no more
files and no more

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.470
folders left to process.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.150
So if it's not equal to
zero, that means I've

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.230
got stuff to do.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.320
So I'm going to have this loop
here going from zero to the

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.500
number of entries
in the array.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500
I check to see if the
entry is a file.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.360
And if it is a file, I have a
function here called addItem

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.450
that's going to add the item to
that little select list on

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:28.980
the left-hand side there.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.490
And then I've got this little
closer function right here

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.490
that's going to get
the metadata for

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.780
that particular file.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.040
In this case, all I'm
interested in

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.940
is the size in bytes.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.240
And I'm not really doing
anything with it.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.780
I'm just showing that
it's possible to get

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.620
information like this.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.590
If it's a directory, on the
other hand, and not a file,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.130
I'm going to push that directory
onto a stack that

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.160
I'm using to process
subfolders.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.020
And then down here at the
bottom, I'm just going to call

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.140
readEntries again.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.220
And so this function is going
to keep calling itself over

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.580
and over until there's
no more files.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.560
Now at the end of this function,
that select list in

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.700
the div on the left is going
to be full of all the files

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.780
that I've processed
and read in.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.410
So now let's go take a look at
the function for the change

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.390
handler and see what happens
when the user actually makes a

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.340
selection in the list.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.500
So if I scroll back down here
to the bottom, remember

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.110
there's this function here
called updateSelection.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.260
So let's scroll on over to
the updateSelection code.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.020
And that is right up here.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.350
PETE LEPAGE: Joe, one thing I
noticed in this particular

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.190
example, you didn't use
an MVC framework or

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.130
anything like that.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.495
Is there a reason why in this
sample you didn't do that?

00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:45.130
JOE MARINI: Just
hacking around.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.040
So I wanted to make a sample
where the code for the Media

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.100
Galleries API was the focus.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.800
And everybody's got their
personal preferences.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.990
People bond with their
MVC frameworks.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.690
PETE LEPAGE: It's true,
Angular rocks.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.540
JOE MARINI: Absolutely, so
please go use Angular.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.340
But whatever MVC framework you
feel like using, that's fine.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.150
I just didn't want that to
be getting in the way.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:07.670
So here in the updateSelection
code, I'm going over the

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.930
length of the gallery array
to get the system that the

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.180
selected file belongs to.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.530
Remember, I stored aside the ID,
and now I'm going to take

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.860
that file and figure out which
gallery it's a part of.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.150
It might be in music, it
might be in pictures,

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.430
it might be in movies.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.450
And what I'm going to do is,
based on the kind of file that

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.760
it is, whether it's a picture,
or music, or whatever, I'm

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.240
going to add that content
to the div.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.240
The way that I'm doing that is
up here I've got these arrays

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.340
with the various
file suffixes.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.170
So I've got image formats like
PNG, and BMP and JPEGs.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:46.140
For video, I've got MOV, and
MPEG, and WEBM and so on.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.840
So that way, I could figure
out what kind of file is.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:52.070
So back down here, let's go back
down to the code where I

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.230
handle the selection.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.630
I'm using these HTML5
data attributes.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.070
Each time an item is added to
the select list, I store the

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.610
path to the item as
a data attribute.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.200
So that way I can just
easily get it again.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.660
So that way, when I get the full
path to the item, again,

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.240
using the HTML5 file
system API right

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.530
here to get the file.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.670
And when that function callback
gets called, I have a

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.750
file entry.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.260
And all I do is clear out the
content div to clear out

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.819
whatever was in there before.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.710
And then I have these various
functions, addImage, addAudio,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.000
addVideo, and so on.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.250
Let's just take a look at the
addImage case because the rest

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.020
of them are just pretty
much carbon copies.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:39.010
So for adding a picture item,
this function right here,

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.520
addImageToContentDiv,
all it does is it

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.990
creates an image element.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.400
It appends the image element
into the content div, and then

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.410
returns that image element back
to the calling function,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.670
so back down here.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.440
And assuming the new element was
created, I have a function

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.180
here that uses the HTML5
file system to just

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.590
read the raw bytes.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.140
So I created a new File
Reader object.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.250
I set up onerror handler.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:12.750
I set up an onloadend handler
function right here.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.950
So when the data is finished
reading, I simply set the

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.790
source of the image element
to the result of

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.670
the file read operation.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.760
So this is going to come
back as a data URL.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.950
Right here on the next line,
on 130, I'm calling

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.100
reader.readAsDataURL.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.920
So if it's an image, it will get
read in as an image data

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.100
URL versus music, versus
video, and so on.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:39.840
And then I just simply append
that content into the source

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.060
attribute for, say, the image,
or the movie, or the video.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.670
So that's basically all
there is to it.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:48.550
I'm using the HTML5 file system
to read the raw bytes.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:52.620
And I'm just relying on the
Media Gallery API to give me

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.730
access to the HTML5 file systems
that represent the

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.600
media galleries.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.250
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.300
JOE MARINI: Pretty
straightforward, yeah.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.950
Code is online.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.480
This sample is in
our GitHub repo.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.560
I encourage you to fork it, and
play with it, test it out.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.360
And that's pretty much
all there is to it.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.200
So if there's questions, we
can start taking those.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.650
PETE LEPAGE: Just one question
that I wanted to

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.910
shoot off the bat.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.390
Is it read-write or is it just
read-only right now?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.900
JOE MARINI: So that's
a good question.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.890
So the intention is when the API
is complete, you'll have

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.140
access to read-only, read-write,
and you'll also be

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.170
able to add new file content to
the user's media galleries.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:38.920
So as the API stands today, we
only support read-only access.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.100
So write is coming, add files
is coming, they're

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.540
just not there yet.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.950
PETE LEPAGE: OK, and I noticed
as I was looking through the

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.280
documentation preparing for this
that some of these things

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.140
are still under the experimental
and some are no

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:51.370
longer under experimental.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.630
Do you want to talk to talk
just really quickly about

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.140
what's still under experimental,
what's not?

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.070
JOE MARINI: If I remember
correctly, the actual code for

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.060
getting the media galleries,
let me bring

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.520
up that page again.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.350
The Media Galleries API itself
was recently moved out from

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.140
experimental.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.380
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, so that's
what it looked like.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:10.670
JOE MARINI: Yeah.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.790
So you no longer need to put
the experimental keyword in

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.610
front of it.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.860
It's ready to go.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.000
PETE LEPAGE: OK, awesome.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.480
Let me bring up some of
the questions that

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.910
we've got over here.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.360
So [? DJazz ?]

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.420
from Sweden wants to know if he
can access the local file

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.900
system using standard open, and
save, save as dialogs with

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.260
a permissions flag.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.690
And I think this is
not necessarily

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.390
specifically with--

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:41.070
JOE MARINI: Yeah, this is not
a Media Galleries specific

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.240
question, but the
answer is yes.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.590
If you're using the HTML5 file
system, you are able to invoke

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.360
an open or save dialog.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.600
In fact, outside of the local
application sandbox, that's

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.000
the only way to get file
content onto the

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.630
user system, so yes.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.430
But the answer is
yes, you can.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.750
That was a rather long-winded
way of saying, yes.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.280
PETE LEPAGE: Excellent.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:10.340
And then the second question
that we had, let me just

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:11.590
reread it here.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.700
Sorry.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.200
Web Intents, I'm going to
skip that question and

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.710
go to the next one.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.540
JOE MARINI: Oh, I think the
web's intents are good.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.990
PETE LEPAGE: Ba boom chang.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.060
Paul, that one was for you.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.880
All right.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.210
And actually, it looks like
that's all the questions that

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.810
we have today.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.360
So nice easy session.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.280
I want to thank everybody
for joining us.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.820
We'll be back next week.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:37.740
Renato and I are going
to be joining you.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.800
So Renato's going
to be joining, I

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.340
guess, me from Sao Paulo.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.310
And we're going to be talking,
I believe, about the Web View

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:55.390
API, so being able to actually
embed, effectively, a web view

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.390
within your Chrome
Application.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.410
So that's going to give you a
lot more flexibility to be

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.500
able to do some things that you
weren't really easily able

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.700
to do before or to be able to
add stuff to your page.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.570
With that, I want to thank
everybody for joining

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.710
us again this week.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.120
It was a really great session.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.000
Thanks to Joe.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.430
Thanks to Peter and Louis in
Mountain View for helping make

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.340
this happen.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.990
With that, we'll see
you guys next week.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.760
Thanks very much.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.630
JOE MARINI: Thanks, everybody.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:23.330
Hit me up on G+.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.960
I'm Joe Marini on G+.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.230
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.480
Thanks, Joe.
