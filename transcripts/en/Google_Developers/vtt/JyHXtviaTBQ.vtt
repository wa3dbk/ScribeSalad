00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.790
TV RAMAN: Welcome to our
hangout on Chrome

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.990
accessibility.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.160
We are talking to you today
about the work we're doing on

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.750
the Chrome, Chrome OS
platform for blind

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.900
and low-vision users.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.550
With me I have James
DeBoer on my

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.450
engineering team on my right.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.040
And next to him, we
have Charles Chen.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.095
And under of the table, watching
the doggy cam, we

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:41.360
have Tilden Labrador.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.260
So brief over of what we'll
talk about today--

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.650
Chrome OS is this really nice
environment that runs on

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.190
Chromebooks and Chromeboxes.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.130
That's a lightweight, desktop,
laptop environment.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.100
You open your laptop, within
five seconds you're on the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.230
network and reading email
and doing what you

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.560
normally do on the web.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
What we wanted to do was to
bring that same level of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.790
simplicity and efficiency
of access to blind

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.380
and low-vision users.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.640
And the result of that work is
this tool that the ChromeVox,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.230
which is a Chrome extension that
runs on pretty much every

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.110
platform that Chrome runs, all
the way from Linux, Mac,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.570
Windows, Chrome OS, and
Android, actually.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.880
For today, we will be focusing
on Chrome OS and show you how

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.170
end user access works.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.070
So what we're talking about
here is primarily spoken

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.350
output for the bilnd user.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.290
The blind user is perfectly
capable of using a keyboard,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.980
touch type.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.990
Chromebook keyboards are just
regular QWERTY keyboards, so

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.530
we don't have to do anything
special there.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.100
We actually have ChromeVox
built into

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.040
every Chrome OS device.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.780
It comes with an extra speech
voice that is fairly

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.140
understandable but not
very high quality.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.590
And then users can actually
get a higher-quality voice

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.800
from the Chrome Web Store.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.090
So for most of this demo,
you'll actually hear the

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.160
higher quality voice.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.560
High level overview
of the sequence of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.060
things we'll show you--

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.050
Charles will start off by
showing you how you can pick

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.350
up a generic Chromebook, hit a
single key, and, as a blind

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.390
user, start using it, including
setting it up,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.070
logging in, setting up the
network, all that good stuff.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.510
And as he's doing that,
initially you will hear the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.510
built-in lower quality voice.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.390
But then once he's signed in,
you'll notice that the quality

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.090
of text to speech drastically
improves.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.050
So Charles, once he has that
set up, will do a couple of

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.990
web searches, show you how you
can listen to web content

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.360
using ChromeVox, and then hand
it over to James, who will

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.750
show you know how web apps
work in this way.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.970
I mean today, things like Chrome
OS are motivated by the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.760
fact that the web is more than
just static documents.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.630
It's a web of applications.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.000
Chrome OS, basically, all the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.180
applications live in the cloud.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.350
And that's what James will show
you with Google Docs.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.310
After that, what we'll
do is more into some

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.530
developer-focused bits.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.660
So what we really want to show
the web community here is how

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.340
end users work with this
technology, but then how you,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.720
as web developers, can leverage
this technology to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.920
make sure that what you're
building is accessible.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.240
Accessibility has always been
a challenge because it has

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.220
traditionally been fairly
complex to test and verify

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.570
accessibility.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.650
And one of the things that we
believe is that by making that

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.670
technology available to every
developer, we drastically

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.480
increase the chances of creating
web content and wep

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.160
apps that are accessible.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.590
So Charles and James will
demo some of that,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.480
including best practices.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.160
And then finally, James will
come back to something really

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.940
cool, which is we, as

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.160
engineers, developed ChromeVox.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.540
And ChromeVox itself is a fairly
complex web extension

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.260
at this point.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.820
And so we need to test ChromeVox
to make sure it is

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.140
doing the right thing.

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.530
And James will show you a test
harness that we've built

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.030
inside ChromeVox that lets
us do that as engineers.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.960
And this is an open
source project.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.510
We'll finally wrap up with a
quick tour of where the code

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.560
is so that you can learn and
leverage what we're building.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.360
So with that, we'll go to the
first stage of this talk,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.800
which is Charles showing you
out of box access on a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.990
Chromebook.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.120
And to repeat, there's nothing
special about that Chromebook

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.690
he's holding.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.920
You could go to a local Best
Buy, or Amazon, or whatever

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.990
and buy a Chromebook, and you
will get exactly what he's

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.890
about to open and show you.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.000
CHARLES CHEN: Thanks Raman.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.350
So let's go over to my
Chromebook here.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.060
And I'm going to log in.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.910
And first, you'll notice that
this is just, like Raman said,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.300
this is a standard Chromebook,
nothing special about it.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.200
It's not talking yet, so
let's get it talking.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.450
It's a very simple command
sequence--

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.295
Control, Alt, and Z. You press
these keys together, and it

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:22.440
will start speaking.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.980
So let's do that.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.460
CHROMEBOOK: Enabling
spoken feedback.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.460
CHARLES CHEN: OK, you just heard
it say, "enabling spoken

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.370
feedback." You also see that
there's now a focus rectangle

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.870
showing where it thinks
its focus is.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.690
And so let's log in and
get on the web.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.616
CHROMEBOOK: Dot, dot, dot,
dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:43.720
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and notice
how it just said "dot," so

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.230
it's not going to blare
out my password,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.300
which is kind of nice.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.010
CHROMEBOOK: Signing in.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.050
Connected to Google Guest.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.580
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so it
told me I signed in.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.070
I'm on Google Guest,
ready to roll.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.060
So let's learn a little
bit more about Chrome.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.430
I'm going to do a search for
Wikipedia on Chrome, and let's

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.680
see what we get.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.522
OK.

00:07:06.522 --> 00:07:07.620
CHROMEBOOK: (DIFFERENT, HIGHER
QUALITY VOICE) Wikipedia

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.150
Chrome Google search.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.510
TV RAMAN: Now, notice that the
voice quality has gone up

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.180
drastically.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.670
That's because he's now signed
in, and it's using the

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.745
higher-quality voice that
is there on the box.

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:19.860
CHARLES CHEN: OK.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.880
And now I can show you I can do
some simple things, such as

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.150
tabbing around this page.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:25.680
CHROMEBOOK: Main ordered
list with 10 items.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.030
List item Google, [? blind ?]

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.450
[? cutting ?]

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:27.725
[? three. ?]

00:07:27.725 --> 00:07:29.610
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so this
actually got me to the first

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:30.610
search result.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.220
If I wanted to read around a
bit, I can do that as well.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.420
All I have to do is hit the
ChromeVox modifier, shift and

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.470
search, and then use
the arrow keys.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.664
CHROMEBOOK: Chrome, hyphen.

00:07:40.664 --> 00:07:43.700
CHARLES CHEN: OK, If I want to
hear more than one shot, I can

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.190
change my granularity levels.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.650
CHROMEBOOK: Wikipedia.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.360
Group, Google Chrome,
hyphen, Wikipedia.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.190
CHARLES CHEN: So this gives
me group reading mode.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.860
So this lets me hear things in
one shot, in a very easy to

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.730
understand way.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.364
So let's go to that link.

00:07:57.364 --> 00:08:00.736
[CHROMEBOOK CHIMES]

00:08:00.736 --> 00:08:02.400
[CHROMEBOOK CHIMES]

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.660
CHROMEBOOK: Google Chrome,
Wikipedia --

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.730
the free encyclopedia.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.390
CHARLES CHEN: You'll also
notice that, as the page

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.060
loads, it made a couple
of dings.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.690
This is to let the user know
that the page is loaded up and

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.860
it's ready to go.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.940
And once it's fully loaded,
you'll also

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.450
hear the page title.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.750
So let's go through this page.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.106
CHROMEBOOK: Google Chrome,
heading one.

00:08:23.106 --> 00:08:25.100
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so it told
you this was a heading.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.110
CHROMEBOOK: From Wikipedia --

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.050
the free encyclopedia.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.240
Jump C8, navigation, internal
link, this article is about

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.289
the web browser or the
operating system.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.000
See Google Chrome [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.663
period.

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:37.900
CHARLES CHEN: OK, now let's
say I want to quickly go

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.299
through some of the
content, quickly

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:40.500
navigate through headings.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.380
I can do that by using Go to
Next Heading, which is simply

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:51.215
ChromeVox modifier, N, and
then H, for next heading.

00:08:51.215 --> 00:08:52.770
CHROMEBOOK: Contents,
heading two.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.470
CHARLES CHEN: So it just jumped
me to the next heading.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.112
I can do that again.

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:58.820
CHROMEBOOK: Left bracket,
heading two.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.490
Left bracket, heading three.

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.820
Left bracket, heading three.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.480
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so it's taking
me through a couple of

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.160
the brackets under different
heading.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.816
I can resume reading.

00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:07.475
CHROMEBOOK: Edit link.

00:09:07.475 --> 00:09:09.400
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so
it's the edit link.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.220
CHROMEBOOK: Right bracket,
public release.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.257
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and I can keep
going from that point.

00:09:14.257 --> 00:09:15.720
CHROMEBOOK: Link.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.010
CHARLES CHEN: So that's
some of the basic

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.960
functionality of ChromeVox.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.250
I'm going to go ahead and hand
it off to James, who

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.430
will show web apps.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.840
James, take it away.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.160
JAMES DEBOER: Thank you.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.813
And I'm going to
set my volume.

00:09:31.813 --> 00:09:34.080
And I have lost my microphone.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.405
CHARLES CHEN: Do you
want to use mine?

00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:37.630
JAMES DEBOER: That would
probably be easiest.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.880
CHARLES CHEN: OK.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.920
TV RAMAN: Yeah, while we get
set up, notice that you've

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.830
seen a web of documents
so far.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.130
Very quickly, we are going to
the interactive, dynamic,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.430
application-oriented web.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.745
And Google Docs is probably the
web app that pushes the

00:09:56.745 --> 00:10:00.810
envelope the most with respect
to using the web platform to

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.790
build a rich specific editor.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.191
And that's what James is
about to show you.

00:10:06.191 --> 00:10:09.060
JAMES DEBOER: All right,
so I have my Google

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.750
Drive home page here.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.920
And sorry, we're--

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.090
CHARLES CHEN: We're tangled.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.550
JAMES DEBOER: We're
lost in the cords.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.540
Let me turn on the volume
of my Chromebook.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:36.230
And so, as you can see, with
the screen, I have spoken

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.240
feedback already enabled.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.205
And I can move around the page
using the ChromeVox keys.

00:10:44.205 --> 00:10:45.455
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.380
JAMES DEBOER: But Google Drive
also has a lot of keyboard

00:10:54.380 --> 00:11:01.830
shortcuts that make it easy to
perform operations within

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.770
Google Drive.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.638
So I'm going to use this
Shift-T shortcut.

00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:06.056
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:06.056 --> 00:11:10.480
D, O, C, S, untitled document,
Google Drive, new line.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.580
JAMES DEBOER: And what
that's done, it's

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.000
opened a new document.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.150
And the cursor, it's
ready to type.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.640
So I can type--

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.112
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:29.862
Line, space.

00:11:29.862 --> 00:11:30.846
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:30.846 --> 00:11:35.380
space G, O, O, G, L, E, space.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:42.940
JAMES DEBOER: And so as I'm
typing, Google Docs is reading

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.060
back through ChromeVox.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.520
And I can move around
my document.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:12:00.900
Now here, Google Docs is using
the ChromeVox API to help

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.110
speak because it's a very
complicated web app.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:16.350
And it's talking directly to
ChromeVox to say, when you

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:21.710
press the arrow key, speak
the letter underneath it.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:27.270
But the ChromeVox navigation
is still available.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.850
So if I used the ChromeVox keys,
such as the up key--

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:33.790
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.710
selected.

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.376
Enable screen reader.

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:39.095
An ordered with one item's
list item, [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:39.095 --> 00:12:44.160
untitled document, menu bar,
file, menu [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.660
JAMES DEBOER: And using the
ChromeVox keys, I can still

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.260
move around the page.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:57.700
And then a number of widgets in
Google Docs are using their

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.770
own keyboard navigation.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.710
So I can just use the arrow
keys, not the ChromeVox keys,

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.686
to interact with the menus.

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:10.070
CHROMEBOOK: Edit collapse
as pop-up.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.210
View collapse as pop-up.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.050
Insert collapse as pop-up.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.286
Insert expanded as pop-up.

00:13:17.286 --> 00:13:18.735
Image.

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:22.400
Control+KL [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.585
Control, plus Alt, plus
M colon, control plus

00:13:25.585 --> 00:13:27.790
alt plus F 6 of 15.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:33.040
JAMES DEBOER: And so here I'm
moving through the menus.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.510
And I can interact with them.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.440
And this is something that
Google Docs has built.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.860
But the ChromeVox navigation
and any other screen reader

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.330
navigation is still available.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.620
TV RAMAN: So James staged
something interesting there,

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.015
which is the topic of a future
hangout that we're hoping to

00:13:53.015 --> 00:13:56.480
do, which is he mentioned
the ChromeVox API.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.150
And what that is is really of
relevance to web developers,

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.200
where if you're building a very
cutting-edge web app and

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.810
you would like to add, augment,
control how things

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:14.160
are spoken, the ChromeVox API
is actually what you use.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.250
So normally, you code your web
app using standard HTML and

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.206
ARIA, which we'll quickly show
you in terms of how those

00:14:21.206 --> 00:14:24.840
things work, do all of your
typical web best practices.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.970
But then, if you finally want
to add a little bit of

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.010
additional accessibility source
for making your apps

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.530
really usable, then the
ChromeVox API, which we will

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.990
detail in a future hangout, is
basically what you would use.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.390
JAMES DEBOER: All right, now I'd
like to show you something

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.910
interesting.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:54.240
So ChromeVox is just a Chrome
extension written entirely in

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.200
JavaScript.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.640
So we write all our tests and
we develop in JavaScript.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.990
So here is some of our tests.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:11.770
And this one that I'm going
to run it is our backward,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.040
forward test.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.730
And what it does is it
stimulates ChromeVox commands

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.120
for moving backwards and
forwards and tries to make it

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.460
all the way through
a web page.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.720
And so this makes it really easy
for us to find bugs in

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.600
ChromeVox and then also to find
interesting web pages

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.140
that break our navigation
model.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.540
And then hopefully
we can fix either

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.670
ChromeVox or the web page.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.322
So let's see let's
see how it does.

00:15:44.322 --> 00:15:45.572
CHROMEBOOK: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.410
JAMES DEBOER: OK, so I've
turned off the sound.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:56.530
But you could hear ChromeVox
talking.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:01.960
And it's running through the
entire web page-- this is the

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.260
Wikipedia home page--

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:09.150
And just going forward, and then
forward again, and back,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.180
and making sure it ends
up in the same place.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.990
And as you can see, it's gone
all the way through the

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.580
Wikipedia homepage and has
made it back to the top.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.820
And so that's a pass.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:30.090
And we run this test and other
tests like it on a number of

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.930
web pages just looking
for errors.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.980
CHARLES CHEN: Well
thanks, James.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.080
Now James said something
interesting about finding

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.730
errors in web pages.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.350
We have automated tests like
these, which will help make

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.570
sure your page navigation
is sensible.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.470
But it's also a good idea to
just run ChromeVox yourself

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.290
and see if it makes sense the
way that your web page is

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:57.380
going through and if you're
managing focus correctly.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.510
I'm about show a demo here which
illustrates some of the

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.220
common pitfalls that web
developers can very easily

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.530
fall into as well as
how to fix them.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.250
So one moment while we swap.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.780
Raman, would you like say a
few words while we swap?

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.170
TV RAMAN: Right, so while
Charles is swapping out, we

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:17.069
are going to show you a very key
piece of functionality in

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.480
a web app that you need to
get right, which is focus

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.790
management.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.020
Because, at the end of the day,
as you move focus in an

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.290
app, is what the user
is working on.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.310
And that's what the user's
getting spoken feedback about.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.810
So if you don't set focus
correctly, when the user, say,

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.980
performs a task that comes back,
it's like you're giving

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.210
your friend a ride but then,
instead of dropping him at the

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.950
front door of his house or
the front door of a large

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.150
building, dropping them off in
the middle of a parking lot

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.960
and saying go find your way.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.060
So Charles will show you
this briefly today.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.690
There's also a much more
detailed version of all of

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.700
these that we did as a talk at
Google I/O. If you just search

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.780
for accessibility in Google I/O
2012, you can watch that

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.900
talk on YouTube.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.530
CHARLES CHEN: OK,
thanks Raman.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.960
So I have a page here that's
an example page.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.770
[CHROMEBOOK CHIMES]

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.480
CHARLES CHEN: OK, and I'm going
to navigate through it.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.235
And I'm going to try and click
on the link. it will bring up

00:18:15.235 --> 00:18:18.020
a pop-up, and let's see what
the behavior is like.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.780
So let's get started.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.330
CHROMEBOOK: Snack attack,
heading one.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.960
Which snacks are best for
hacking all night long?

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.940
List with eight items, list
item, pizza delivery, link.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.860
Object, list with eight
items, list item,

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.360
pizza delivery, link.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.890
CHARLES CHEN: OK,
so far, so good.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.170
I managed to navigate
to the first choice.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.080
I really like pizza.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.345
Let's try clicking this.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:43.260
OK, so what just
happened here?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.050
If I was relying solely on
speech, I would think nothing

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.820
happened because even though
there's a visual pop-up, you

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.020
don't hear anything.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.140
So you really don't know
what's going on here.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.100
But let's say I'm going to
take it on faith that

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.740
something happened.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.490
Let's try reading.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.080
Let's see what I hear next.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.250
CHROMEBOOK: 7,965 ratings.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.300
CHARLES CHEN: Wait, where
is that on the screen?

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.730
CHROMEBOOK: List item,
caffeinated soda, link.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.720
CHARLES CHEN: Wait, that's
not even on the

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.960
screen anymore, is it?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.760
So what happened here is there
was a pop-up that came out,

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.800
but like Raman said, this is
equivalent to taking your

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.580
friend somewhere and dropping
them in the middle of a street

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.370
and saying you're there instead
of helping them all

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.120
the way to where they
need to go.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.760
A pop-up has happened, but it's
somewhere at the end of

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.220
the DOM, and the user hasn't had
their focus moved there.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.640
So the user at this
point is kind of

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.240
struggling on this page.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.400
They don't know where the pop-up
is, and as far as they

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.260
can tell, nothing has actually
happened, which leads to a

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.080
pretty frustrating and broken
user experience.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.920
So let's see how we can
make this much better.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.150
CHROMEBOOK: Google X, Chrome,
Googlecode.com

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.860
slash, E, O, N. [? Cafe ?]

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.670
Snack Attack.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.760
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so this page
visually looks identical.

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.090
But let's see what happens when
you navigate through it.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.280
CHROMEBOOK: Snack Attack,
heading one.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.880
Which Snacks are best for
hacking all night long?

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.560
Object, which snack, list with
eight items, list item, pizza

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.405
delivery, button.

00:20:11.405 --> 00:20:13.690
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so let's
do this again.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.950
CHROMEBOOK: Entering dialog,
rating dialog, no ratings,

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.600
slider, no rating.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.000
CHARLES CHEN: OK, so in this
case, the main difference is

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.530
that, in this example, we've
managed focus properly.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.360
So when a pop-up shows up, we
then put focus on the thing

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.090
that makes the most sense,
which is the ratings bar.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:34.830
And in that case, it triggers
ChromeVox or any other screen

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.870
reader into reading the fact
that the user has entered a

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.630
dialog as well as what they're
currently focused on, which is

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.140
the ratings bar.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.730
And so with that, you can
now drive the ratings.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.580
CHROMEBOOK: One star,
ew, gross.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.910
Two stars, meh.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.730
Three stars, OK, sure.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.495
Four stars, awesome.

00:20:51.495 --> 00:20:52.790
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I think
that's pretty awesome.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.055
So, but let's see what
five stars does.

00:20:55.055 --> 00:20:57.836
CHROMEBOOK: Five stars,
NOMNOMNOM.

00:20:57.836 --> 00:20:59.560
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I kind
of I like that.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.110
So let's go, and let's
vote on this.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.104
CHROMEBOOK: Vote, button.

00:21:03.104 --> 00:21:04.400
CHARLES CHEN: OK, I'm
going to vote.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:04.650
CHROMEBOOK: Saving.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.335
CHARLES CHEN: And it even tells
me that it's saving.

00:21:06.335 --> 00:21:06.610
CHROMEBOOK: Exiting dialog.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.870
List with eight items, list
item, pizza delivery, button.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.050
CHARLES CHEN: So that's a much
friendlier user experience,

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:15.440
and that really helps the user
know what they're doing.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.170
So with that, Raman, do you
want to add anything?

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:18.700
TV RAMAN: Sure, yeah.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.990
And so basically, for what
Charles showed you, we have

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.260
markup examples of this from
a Google I/O talk.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.950
None of those is new source
that we're inventing.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.230
This is all standard
HTML5 ARIA bits.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.920
The focus management things are

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.090
really, really key, though.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.730
Those are things that you need
to do in your JavaScript

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.420
handlers in terms of how you
handle pop-ups and how you

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.220
handle dialogs.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.380
This is not something
that a standard

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.470
specification will tell you.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.550
These are more implementation
techniques.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.710
As we sort of wrap this up, as
I said at the top of this

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.950
talk, this is an open
source project.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.460
Our goal is to open source this
for a couple of reasons.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.930
One, Chrome itself is an open
source platform, and having

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.800
ChromeVox as an open source tool
really has zero impedance

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.220
mismatch with the project.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.830
But more importantly, we'd like
to take the magic and

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.070
black art out of accessibility
and make it something that is

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.860
a well-understood,
easy-to-do bit.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.210
Because when we do that, more of
you who are web developers

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.660
will implement accessibility,
and we all win.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.080
And towards that end, I'd like
Charles and James to give you

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.500
a quick overview of where the
core ChromeVox code is.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.720
All of our code on an open
source Google code project

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.340
called Google-axs-chrome.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.745
Charles, do you just
want to give a--

00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:44.340
CHARLES CHEN: Yeah, so I already
have the ChromeVox

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:45.980
Google code page up here.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.525
So, as Raman mentioned, the URL
is simply Google-axs-chrom

00:22:48.525 --> 00:22:49.775
e.Googlecode.com.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.990
And all of our source code is
here, this includes ChromeVox

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.460
as well some of our other
projects, such as a low-vision

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.500
tool, our ChromeVis, and you can
also get our voice here,

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.370
our Lois TTS.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.120
This also includes our Google
I/O talks, which include all

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.320
the examples that we
just went through.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.300
And if you're interested in
contributing, there's the

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.070
source link right up here.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.540
And that will tell you how you
can check out the code.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.830
And patches are very welcome
and appreciated.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.010
TV RAMAN: So for platforms
where ChromeVox isn't

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.150
pre-built in, so you're a Linux
developer and you're

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.640
developing your web app on
Linux, or a Macbook, or a

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.550
Windows box, or whatever,
you will need to install

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.170
ChromeVox, the extension, from
the Chrome web store.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.730
And Lois, which Charles
mentioned, is the low end

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.760
voice that I talked about
at the beginning.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.220
And if you search in the Chrome
Web Store for Google

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:48.530
TTS, you also see our higher
quality voice.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.720
It's a bigger download, the
higher quality voice,

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.490
obviously, because it's
higher quantity.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.140
And then you get a much
better sounding voice.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.830
Play with that, send us email.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.590
The project page tells us
how you can find us.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.340
There's a Google group
for this work.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.720
Above all, test your code
with ChromeVox, test the

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.940
experience.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:12.060
And it'll make a difference both
to your site and to the

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:13.130
users who come to your site.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:14.300
Thank you.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.550
CHARLES CHEN: Thanks.
