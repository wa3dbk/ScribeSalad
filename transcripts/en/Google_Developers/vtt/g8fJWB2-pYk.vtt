[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:11.910
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.180
Well, hello everybody.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.670
And welcome to another Chrome
Apps Office Hours.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.740
Today I'm joined by Mike Tsao,
who is joining me from

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.570
Mountain View.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.740
Mike, do you want to
introduce yourself?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.570
MIKE TSAO: Sure.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.930
Thanks, Pete.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.180
Hi.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.340
My name's Mike Tsao.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.400
I'm an engineer on the Chrome
Apps and Notifications team,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.905
and I'm working on
notifications.

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.230
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.170
So Mike's joining us today,
because he's been one of the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.270
main guys who's been building
the new rich notification

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.220
system for Chrome apps.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.370
If you've played with the WebKit
notifications or the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.610
HTML5 notifications before in
Chrome and in other browsers,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.230
you're somewhat familiar with
some of the notification stuff

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.580
that's available.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.380
But the new notification system
really allows you to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.890
provide much richer and, I
think, much more beautiful

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.550
notifications within
your application.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.270
If we can switch over to my
screen for a sec so we can

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.390
have a look at a couple
of these.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.090
So there's four different types
of notifications that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.760
are available to users or
to you as a developer.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.850
There's the basic notification,
which is just

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.290
simply an image and some text.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.320
There's a simple notification,
which is, again, an

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.910
image and some text.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.680
You can provide a little
bit more text on that.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080
And you can also provide
buttons.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.280
I don't have any buttons shown
on the sample that I have on

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.610
screen right now.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.160
The third type is an
image notification.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.450
So you can pop up an image, so
that you can provide, hey,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.650
maybe somebody has
added new photos.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.460
You can think something similar
to what Google+ does

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.900
on an Android phone.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.580
When there's a new image,
you see that

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.520
little bit of the image.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.900
And finally, the fourth type
of notification is a list

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.880
notification.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.310
This is really great for if
you have a whole bunch of

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.890
things that you need to tell the
user about, but you don't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.530
want to put them all into
five or six different

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.760
notifications.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.550
You can go in and put in
five different types.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.330
And with the simple, the
image, and the list

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.470
notification, those
are all available.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.450
You can add buttons to each of
those so that the user can

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.910
interact with each of those.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.070
Right now, this stuff is under
the experimental API, but

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.800
that's changing.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.310
Mike, you said you pushed
some of that stuff in

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.090
earlier this week.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.710
So it should be going away?

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.270
MIKE TSAO: Yeah.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.600
We have a change list that's
in flight right now that's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.000
going to be taking us out of
experimental and into dev

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.200
channel only.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.100
And what that means is that now
it'll be easier for you to

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.090
distribute your extension or
app to users who are on the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.540
dev channel without making them
go through the hassle of

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.910
turning on the experimental
flag.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.200
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.470
So once that goes away,
that's going to make

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.840
things a lot easier.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.140
The demo that I'm going to show
you today, I'm running it

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.770
in Chromium.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:21.430
Because right now this
only works on

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.450
Chrome OS and on Windows.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.990
It's not available quite yet
on Mac, but it is coming.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.070
It's something we're working on,
so we expect to see that

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:31.950
land in the near future.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.420
So the rich notification
API, it's

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.980
chrome.notification.create.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.940
And there's three parameters
it takes.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.120
An ID, so that on any of the
callbacks, you know which

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.650
notification showed up.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.430
There's options, which we'll
talk about in a sec, and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.740
creation Callback, so the
callback that gets called once

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.000
the notification has shown up.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.070
The object that you pass for
the notifications takes a

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.460
couple of different things.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.120
So it takes the template type.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.990
And all of this stuff is not
in the documentation yet.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.420
We're a little bit ahead of
the documentation on this,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.150
which I always think
is kind of fun.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.730
So you can find some stuff here
as well, we'll put up in

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.660
a minute or two.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.620
There's a blog post with
a little bit more.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.000
So template type takes either
basic, simple, image, or list,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.320
depending on what type of
notification you want to show,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.140
the title, the message.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.220
In some cases, you can have the
expanded message, which is

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.110
going to show up on the basic
notification, I believe.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.600
The image URL.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.660
So if you're going to have that
image pop up, you want to

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.280
provide the image URL
so it knows where to

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.790
grab the image from.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.540
And if you're going to have a
list that items takes in an

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.760
array with the list of things
that you want to show up.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.990
So it takes title and message.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.310
You can also--

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.600
MIKE TSAO: One more thing
I'd like to point

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.730
out, Pete, if I may?

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.645
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:10.645 --> 00:06:17.940
MIKE TSAO: If you're using the
icon URL fields, then for a

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.160
packaged app, you're going to be
subject to content security

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.370
policy, CSP, versus if you're
using it in an extension, the

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.040
CSP is pretty lax there.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.520
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.720
OK.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.490
MIKE TSAO: One slightly
surprising behavior might be

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.310
that you're not able to just
head off to the open web and

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.440
grab an image from there to
display in your notifications.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.350
So be aware of CSP for packaged
apps, and try to

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.110
avoid being surprised by that.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.730
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.840
That's a really good point.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.010
In fact, in the demo we'll show
in a sec, we've handled

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.820
that where the images
are there locally.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.270
And I'll show you how we
did that in a sec.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.640
And then there's a set of rich
notification events that you

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.980
can have as well.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.320
So that when the notification is
shown, when it's closed, if

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.950
it's clicked, or if the user
clicks on a button, obviously,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.670
you need to have a callback so
that you can handle each of

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.790
those particular things.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.510
So with that, let's pop out of
here, and let's go have a look

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.510
at a real, live demo.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.010
Lovely.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.640
I always love it
when my virtual

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.970
machine locks up on me.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.100
There we go.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.500
All right.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.940
So here we go.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:37.940
I've got this running.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.660
Like I said, it only
runs in Windows and

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.080
Chrome OS right now.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.090
And unfortunately, I don't have
a Chrome OS set up in

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.625
canary or dev, but I'll get that
going hopefully in the

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:50.390
near future.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.650
This notification--

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.850
if we can pop up the URL for the
sample app right now, this

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.350
is in the Chrome app sample.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.740
So you can go and grab
this from the URL.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.920
So the first letter there, that
says a zero, not an O. So

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.440
it's O, capital U--

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:09.840
Sorry.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.610
Zero, capital U, small N,
capital U, capital V.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.590
Somewhere that way.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.330
Yeah.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.970
Anyways, so here we go.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.000
We've got this app.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.700
If I click on this button, it's
going to show a simple

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.640
notification.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.050
So sure enough, there's the
simple notification.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.370
And you can see that
it's a simple

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.610
notification, just some text.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.159
If I close this guy--

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.440
click on Close.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.980
And instead of having a mail
icon, I want an Africa icon.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.580
We can change the icon, the
image that shows up there, to

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:49.580
be whatever you want.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:55.990
This app just has a couple of
predefined ones set up here.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:57.000
Image notification.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.340
You can see here we've got
a nice, big size image.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.470
We've got the title.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.430
You've got the text below it.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.340
And a list notification.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.550
So it shows up with
all of the things.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.405
I'll close this guy, and
I'll add a button.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.460
Show a photo on G+.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.770
So for example, I
could do this.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.460
And sure enough, when the user
clicks on that, the event gets

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.990
called and you can open up
a window to whichever

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.950
application that you
want to happen.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.800
So let's take a look
at the code for

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.010
how this guy is written.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:46.970
And I'll bring up Sublime and
have a look at my main JS.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.680
So one thing I want
to point out.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.840
All of the code for this
application was written in the

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.470
actual app JavaScript file.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.180
But I think in a real
application, you're probably

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.410
not going to want to do that.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.590
You're probably going to want to
put the notification events

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.825
and notification handlers and
all that kind of stuff into

00:10:08.825 --> 00:10:12.240
the app JS or into
the main JS file.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.160
And the reason why I say that
is because if you want a

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.290
notification to pop up, you
probably want the notification

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.180
to pop up when the application
maybe isn't running, when

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.570
certain events happen.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.090
Or if the app is already
running, the user's already

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.070
probably in it and using it.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.490
But you want to be able to pop
those notifications up even if

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.920
the user's not running
the application.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.670
So by putting the events and the
handlers into your main JS

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.970
file, you can listen for alarms,
you can put some of

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.070
your background processing
script in there.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.360
So that way, things are running
as you'd expect.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.450
So let's have a quick peek at
what's going on in this

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.420
application.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.290
So the way that we wrote this
here is all of the images that

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.920
are possible that you can have
in the array list, so as you

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.110
pop up that particular
notification.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.320
We've got that.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.190
And then in this particular
case, just because we wanted

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.150
to be able to show the
different types of

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.940
notifications, we created a set
of objects that have each

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.890
of the different
set of options.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.610
You can see here, here's the
list with title list

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:36.410
notification, a message, and
then each of the list items.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.330
And then we add our
Event Listeners.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.290
So go in.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.050
On our page load, we say,
Chrome experimental

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.080
notification on display.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.410
Add Listener.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:55.600
And our callback is the
notification displayed.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.090
So when the user runs this, we
call the Do Notify event.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.170
So on any of the clicks to any
of the events, we go in,

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:09.210
figure out which element or
which button they clicked on.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.150
Now, we talked about-- and Mike
mentioned this earlier.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.000
Making sure that your image
comes from your local file

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.780
system, so that you're not hit
by any of the CSP things.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:26.090
So here in our image URL, we
say, chrome.runtime.geturl.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:33.150
And we provide the URL to
the particular image.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.490
So that way, it's going
to give us that

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:37.290
fully-qualified URL.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.550
So that way, when it goes to
grab that image, we pull it

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.940
from our local file system.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.800
We're all good to go.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.980
We don't have to worry about,
hey, where did that image come

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.310
from, what are the CSP rules.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.670
We know that we're getting the
image from the right place.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.070
And then finally, on our
options.button, we can go in

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.190
and say, buttons and push the
two buttons into the array

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.790
lists if there are
two buttons.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.600
Or maybe we only just
need one button.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.170
And then finally,
chrome.notifcation.create.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.690
In this particular case, we're
just using a simple ID based

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.290
on the number.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.220
But you can use whatever
you want in here.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.060
We pass it our options and
our create Callback.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.970
So it's a pretty simple thing
to go and create these

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:27.400
notifications.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.720
We've got our callback
handlers that

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.820
show each of the events.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.250
So actually, I'm going to
pop back over to our

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.130
sample here for a sec.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:43.460
And if I go in and Inspect
Element, so that we can see

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.410
what's happening in the console,
you can see all of

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.870
the different events that
happened in here.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.360
And we can see, oh, notification
ID was closed.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.060
Notification ID1 was displayed
to the user.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:02.620
So if I add an image
notification and I click on

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.280
this button, if we go down
here to the very bottom,

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.510
notification ID14 was
successfully created and our

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.900
notification button
0 was clicked.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.530
So it's a relatively easy way
to be able to go and pop up

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.950
notifications and tell
the user about things

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.430
that are going on.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.350
So we just put up on screen
the link to questions.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.120
So if you have questions about
these notifications or how you

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.790
can use these notifications in
your app or where to expect

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.230
these, go post your questions
in Moderator, and we'll take

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:43.220
them here in just about
two minutes or so.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.470
So like I said, getting
this to run is a

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.670
relatively simple process.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.890
There are, I believe--

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.530
Let's just double-check
on this.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.590
I don't believe you need--

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.780
Actually, maybe Mike, you
can tell me while I

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.400
try to look it up.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.980
Does the application need any
particular permissions to be

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.715
able to use these?

00:15:05.715 --> 00:15:08.170
MIKE TSAO: Yes.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.930
At this moment, you're going
to need the experimental

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.320
permission, because it's
an experimental API.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:18.670
When we leave experimental,
it's going to require the

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.510
notification permission.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.360
And this is not a very noisy
permission in the sense that

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.720
it's the kind of thing that will
scare away your users.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.060
It's pretty straightforward
stuff, but you will need that.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.530
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.490
All right.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.590
Well, let's pop over
to questions.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.760
If we can bring the question
URL back up.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.330
It looks like I have lost my
internet connection, which is

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.720
always a little bit of fun.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.890
Oh, there we go.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:50.230
All right.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.870
So you can post your
questions in there.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.030
There are no questions
yet, but that's OK.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.830
One of the things that I think
is really exciting about this

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.920
is it really does provide an
easy way for developers to be

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.970
able to alert people about stuff
that's going on within

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:09.810
their apps.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.810
And your apps don't necessarily

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.730
always have to be running.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.910
If you put the handler for this
inside the main JS file

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.980
or inside your background script
and you handle things

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:27.580
like maybe you're listening for
new data that gets posted

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.460
to a server.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.980
Maybe you're using the Alarms
API and you want to pop a

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.720
notification up that reminds the
user that, hey, it's maybe

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.340
time to take your medication
or hey, you haven't been to

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.190
the gym today, you should
go to the gym.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.920
That would be a great little
thing that Fit Better, any of

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:52.290
those fitness applications
went in and used.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.410
So I think with that, it looks
like there aren't too many

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.490
questions today.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.398
So Mike, do you have anything
that you want to add?

00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:04.930
MIKE TSAO: Well, we're really
excited about this API.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.109
And particularly visually, it's
turned out really nicely.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.050
And we're happy about that.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.849
And it's a super simple
API to use.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:19.760
We're going to be adding more
templates in the future to

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.785
cover different use cases.

00:17:20.785 --> 00:17:21.369
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, awesome.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.560
MIKE TSAO: So now is really the
time for people to get in

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.329
there and give it a try and make
sure that we've covered

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.690
every use case that
we can think of.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.650
If there is a particular
template or layout that you're

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.070
really wanting, then this is a
great time to suggest that.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:42.970
And we'll get our UX and UI
folks working on it to make it

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.112
look gorgeous for you.

00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:44.540
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.310
That's great.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.740
So for those of you who do want
your own templates and

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:54.200
want to provide, go file a bug
on CR Bug, Chromium Bugs.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.370
And let us know about
it, so that we know.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.960
And then get your friends to
go and star those bugs, so

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.470
that we see that there's
a lot of community

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.500
interest behind that.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.010
Cool.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.920
Well, Mike, thanks
for joining me.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.200
I know it's a little bit early
for you, so thanks for coming

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.460
in early and joining
us and talking a

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.620
little bit about this.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.660
And thanks, everybody,
for tuning in.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.650
We'll be back next week,
Tuesday, at our

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.940
regular time and place.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.080
Thanks, guys.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.330
MIKE TSAO: Thanks, Pete.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.072
