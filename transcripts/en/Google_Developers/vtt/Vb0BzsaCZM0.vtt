00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.984
Welcome to Google Developers
Weekly for November 25, 2013.

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.566
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.420
and off.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.970
It was an incredible week for
developers here at Google.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.720
So let's get right to it,
and we'll start with Glass.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.990
Timothy Jordan, never seen
without his trademark hat,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.290
gave us a sneak peek of the
brand new Glass Development

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.960
Kit.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.300
The GDK lets us glimpse the
future of cool apps on Glass.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.770
Also last week, we hosted
the Chrome Dev Summit,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.310
an incredible two-day
web platform experience.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.610
This event featured an
overwhelming 12 plus hours

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.770
of presentations on Dart, Blink,
Page Speed, PNaCl, and more.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.560
If you missed anything, we
have it archived for you.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.290
And if that wasn't
enough, Colt McAnlis

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.400
teamed up with the TimesOpen
team from the New York Times

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.274
to talk about tuning
websites and mobile apps

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:43.350
for performance.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.440
You have a need for speed,
and so do your users.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.900
And we've all seen the headlines
about large-scale password

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.640
leaks.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.170
Breno de Medeiros
and Tim Bray, who

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.560
are not excited
about this trend,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.770
talk about best practices
and raw survival

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.480
on how to keep your accounts
and information safe.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.481
And Drive and Gmail are
getting closer together.

00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:01.230
Steve Bazyl highlights
the new integration

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.930
of Gmail attachments
and Drive and what

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.196
this means for developers
on your Drive apps.

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:07.570
But Drive isn't the only Google
app getting new features.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.028
Jonathan Simon
walks us through how

00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:11.700
you can set up and use a
Google Cloud SQL instance.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.350
This event covers
creating a database

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.290
and connecting to it, setting
up PHP pages, and much more.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.620
If your app is up in the clouds,
make sure you watch this video.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780
We then welcome back
YouTuber Ikai Lan

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.410
from New York as
he tells us where

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.800
to go for all the latest
information on our Java API

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.970
client libraries.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.310
Whether you use Maven or
Gradle, Ikai has your answers.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.030
And we're celebrating the half
birthday of Google Play games.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.740
But you're getting the gift.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.000
Todd Kerpelman is giving
everybody updated SDKs.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.329
So watch this event
for all the fun.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.870
And every year at
this time, the days

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.680
get very short or very long,
depending on where you live.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.610
And Google Code-in gets going.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.870
Pre-university students can
sign up for Google Code-in

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.500
and work on real world
open-source software projects,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.560
learn a lot, and
even win prizes,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.360
including a trip
to the Googleplex.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.540
Check out the program
site to find out more.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.900
Also, the Google
Civic Information API

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.512
got an important upgrade
for US users this week.

00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:04.220
Now you can write apps
that connect users

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.770
to their local
elected government,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.973
all the way down to
municipal officials.

00:02:07.973 --> 00:02:10.139
And our newest Chrome
experiment, "A Journey Through

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.140
Middle-earth,"
launched this week.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.210
It's an interactive
experience for "Hobbit" fans.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.668
And for mobile web
developers, it's

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.440
a great demonstration of what's
possible on mobile devices

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.600
using HTML5 and technologies
like the Touch Events API, Web

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.620
Audio API, and Media Queries.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.620
And SPDY, S-P-D-Y, is
our experimental protocol

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.540
for making the web faster,
and it's doing a great job.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.160
This week we published
results showing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.190
that SPDY has dramatically
reduced latency

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.970
in Google's major
web applications,

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150
and the SPDY work continues.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.100
And to make sure you never
miss a thing, speedy or slow,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.870
from the world of
Google Developers,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.880
subscribe to the Google
Developers on YouTube and check

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.170

I'm Louis Gray, and I'll
see you in the studio.
