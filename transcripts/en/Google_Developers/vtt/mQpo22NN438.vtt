00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, I'd like to take a little bit
of time now to see if we can look at a few

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.600
of these cool extensions that have been made
already. And I'm really happy to be able introduce

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.369
somebody that we've been working with closely
in the community from pretty early on. So,

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.810
Colin from Xmarks, come on up and let’s
see your extension.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.019
&gt;&gt; BLECKNER: Thanks, guys. I'm Colin. I'm
here with Will. We’re Software Developers

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.870
for Xmarks. One of our main products is a
Cross Browser Extension that synchronizes

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.899
your Bookmarks between different computers
and browsers. And we're happy to be here today

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.150
talking about one of our recent projects,
Xmarks for Chrome. We'll start with this quick

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.469
demo of Xmarks in action. You can access our
main UI from the Xmarks icon on the top-right.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.280
As you can see, we're currently synchronizing
successfully. And from this page we can also

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.539
access some of our other local settings. Xmarks
icon also gives us a shortcut to my.xmarks.com.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.699
This Website gives you online access to your
Bookmarks from any computer as well as some

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.650
of our more advanced online features. And
since we're already synchronizing, you can

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.159
see the bookmarks in those browser that match
up of what you see here in the Bookmark bar

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.750
for Chrome. So, to show Xmarks in action,
Will is actually going to delete one of his

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.490
Bookmarks on our website. That means the next
time we sync in Chrome, that deletion will

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.579
come down and we’ll move it in Chrome, too.
So, if you go to the Xmarks icon and hit “synchronize

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.040
now,” look at that synchronize go, and when
it finishes, that Bookmark should also get

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.229
removed from Chrome. That's taking a little
second. There you go. The Bookmark is gone

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.090
there, too. Similarly, if we were to add a
Bookmark in Chrome, or move things around

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.450
and then synchronize after that, that change
will go back to our servers and from there,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.751
out to any other computers and browsers running
Xmarks. As a software developer, there are

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.869
a couple of things that I'm excited about
in Chrome. The first is that everything is

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.020
written in HTML and JavaScript. This makes
it really easy for us to put over our existing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.390
extensions. Xmarks for example has a lot of
client side code. And we're able to pour it

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.969
pretty much all of our core sink code to Chrome
without any changes at all. And we didn’t

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.351
just happened to get lucky in this one case.
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at search

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:05.020
tabs. This is another Xmarks extension that
helps users discover similar sites while they’re

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.330
searching. I got it up and running in Chrome
in less than a day and there's something like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.739
50 Chrome specific lines of code. Everything
else was shared Cross Browser Code. This is

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.940
a huge win for us and not just because we
get things up and running so fast, more importantly

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.500
for me, it means that maintaining that code
in those extensions is going to be a lot more

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.120
manageable for us in the future. The second
thing I'm excited about is that the extension

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.320
API has access to HTML5 features. When I first
started working on Xmarks for Chrome, one

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.780
of the biggest issues I had was figuring out
how to store information on a user’s computer.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.069
We store a lot of data locally to help speed
up our sink process, but the extension API

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.840
doesn't, you know, have any file I/O code
or support. However, HTML5 has things like--it's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.810
got local storage in SQL data bases. And so,
I was able to take our file I/O code and rewrite

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.610
that using this HTML5 features, and everything
else runs smoothly on top of that. Overall,

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.800
I'm pretty excited to be writing extensions
for Chrome. I think that the extension API

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.710
itself really promotes Cross Browser development
and that's going to make it a lot easier for

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.390
us to build and maintain our extensions. So,
thanks again, guys. And up next we could got

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:14.040
Jeff talking about Google Translate.
&gt;&gt; JEFF: Hi. I'm Jeff from the Google Translate

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.731
Team. Before I begin, I wanted to just give
a quick shout out to Jerry Tieng (ph). The

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:24.860
Engineer who developed the translate extension.
Unfortunately, he couldn't be here. So, I'll

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.709
be giving the demo instead. So, let's say
you're searching for the top French news stories,

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:39.849
and start by going to google.fr. Since the
content of this page is in French but my browser

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.959
language is an English, the translate extension
will pop up and prompt me to see if I--whether

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.250
or not I want to translate this page into
English. Since I don't speak French, you know,

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.260
I'll go ahead and click on translate. And
voila, the page is now instantly translated

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.030
into English so I can read and understand
it. So now I'm looking for news, so now, you

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.849
know, I'm able to find news since it’s in
my language. I'll go ahead and click on the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:14.849
news link. And since this next page is also
in French, the translate extension will immediately

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:21.270
translate the page as well. So, if the translate
extension looks similar or the same as the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.940
Website translator gadget that's on Google
Translate, well, the reason why is because

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.951
it's the same code. Developing the translate
extension was quick and easy because we are

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:36.860
able to leverage the existing code that we've
created. In order to reuse this code though

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.300
we had to propose or re-propose to extensions--two
functions to the extensions API. The first

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.290
one, detects language, automatically detects
the language of the page and returns it to

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:56.030
us. We use this to determine whether or not
we should prompt and show the standard to

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.660
the user to translate the page. The second
function executes script allows us to inject

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.590
our existing gadget code into the page and
tell the browser to execute it. So in summary,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.611
developing the translate extension for Chrome
was extremely easy and quick because we are

00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:16.560
able to reuse and leverage existing code.
And if there's a function that you need that

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.630
doesn't yet exist, you can propose it to the
Chrome team and once approved, you can work

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:30.840
with them to get it implemented. And next,
I'll--Adam from eBay will share with you his

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.910
experience.
&gt;&gt; ADAM: Thanks. It's great to be here. You

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.240
know, it's been a long time since we started
eBay as just a Website. Ever since we first

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.320
launched our public APIs in 2000, we really
viewed eBay as an E-commerce platform, where

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.120
our customers can buy and sell wherever they
are, really creating a new and much more robust

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.690
site than what we had before. And we sort
of called this policy “eBay anywhere.”

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.530
We want our customers whether they're using
a mobile device, whether on eBay.com, whether

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.800
they're using a desktop gadget to experience
eBay wherever they are. And that's why development

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.770
environment, such as, Google Chrome are so
important to us because we know that many

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.290
of our customers do use Chrome. And we want
them to have fantastic experience when they

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.230
do so. Now, I'm going to give a quick demo
of an extension that one of our team has been

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.680
working on. Just like the Translate Team,
Diane Forch [PH], she couldn't be here today

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.250
because they are in London. But I'm going
to do a demo on their behalf. So, again, it

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.891
doesn't matter. You could be on a page, you
know, searching news at google.fr. And you

00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:38.180
say, “Hey, I want to check to see what's
going on eBay.” And so, we have a menu right

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.330
here and you can go and click and find out
what's going on. I'm already signed in, so

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.930
you can see I’m sort of watching a couple
items: Lego Star Wars, new sneakers. I’m

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.860
going to say, “Oh, maybe I want to get that.”
You know, but wanting more information, you

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.610
know, you can sort of click and see more and
sort of just little fade, it moves over, and

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.540
you can see all the information you want to
know about the item, or and, actually, if

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:05.381
you want to, you can go and place more, go
and actually place the bid. Alternately, this

00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:09.660
is sort of what we call “my eBay interface.”
And so, those are active items. We also have

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.280
ended items, right? These are all the things
that I've been watching or buying or lost.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.680
And if I say, “Hey, I want to try to find
that. Hey, what was that item that I just

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.830
won? ”Well, then I can just sort of click
here, pull up a little menu and do a filter

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:26.180
in place just to find the item that I won,
and there it appears, right? So now, it's

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.880
changed so I should leave a bid to lead feedback.
So, everything is sort of in context, in place,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.020
really easy to filter it. Of course, we also
have the ubiquitous search box, so I could

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.250
look for kittens, for example, but, you know,
we actually have policy. You can’t sell

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:55.081
kittens on eBay, so. So, I won't do that because
Lord knows what might show up. Sorry, do it

00:07:55.081 --> 00:08:00.130
yourself. Anyway, so, once again, we really
enjoyed, it’s really a fun experience writing

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.410
the extension. The integrated development
environment, which you sort of saw earlier,

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:09.360
made it much easier for us to build and debug
it. Also, we have existing extensions for

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.860
other browsers and similar to what you also,
again, heard before, it was very easy for

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.330
us to port over our code. All the business
logic, this one straight over, and then we

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:23.420
had to go and tackle the UI that we just have
to do that for Chrome, and that made, again,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:29.630
keeping all of our code basis in synch nice
and easy. In fact, that's one of the things

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:35.080
that we really took advantage of when we were
doing the design with the HTML5 and CSS3 to

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.970
do what we really wanted, because Chrome has
a different approach as you learned. More

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:45.580
minimal approach to user interface and we
had to figure out how do we tackle that problem,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.270
you know, while we're miming Webby and also
eBay. And so, those were really great. I sort

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.490
of thinking about how to handle it and also
we want with a sort of a mobile approach,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.480
because they both have in some ways that are
restrained, real stay, and smaller UI that

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.870
needs to get done. And so, when we tackle
that, we said, “Hey, we can take advantage

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.970
of CSS3 to do rounded corners and gradients
for the background.” Things that we had

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.030
done before, but we had to put image hacks
and things we didn’t like. So this was much

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:18.960
cleaner and really simplified our presentation
logic. Likewise, with HTML5, we will to go

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.651
much more or beyond the fact that we have
cookies, right? So with eBay, there are a

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.120
lot of user preferences, there's a lot of
data for each of the items that you can be

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:30.950
watching up to 200. In this case, we were
able to use the Name Value Pair Database for

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.950
all of our preferences. We've able to use
the SQLite database to store all the items

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.400
and made it very for us to really keep all
the information right here and improve the

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.060
speed and efficiency, which is, again, something
that we really want to make sure our customers

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.440
experience. So overall, we really had a fantastic
time with working with the Chrome Team and

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.770
we really want to thank them for all the support
that they've given us. The best part from

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:59.360
my standpoint is when we built this extension,
everything we saw here those are our public

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.270
APIs. We don't have to make any changes to
our own APIs to implement this. So, any developer

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.270
whether it’s eBay or anyone in this room
or anyone in the Internet, can go and build

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.820
that right now. And so, we really hope that
developers will see this as a great opportunity

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:19.620
for them to use Chrome as a platform to extend
and great fantastic extensions for our community.

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.730
So, if anybody wants to talk to me, I'll be
out of here later. And so, now I'm going to

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:29.890
hand it over to Nick from Google.
