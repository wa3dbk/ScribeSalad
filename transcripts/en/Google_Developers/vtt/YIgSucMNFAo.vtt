00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.000
Hello and welcome to another
episode of GDL Israel Google

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.750
Developer Live.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.610
We are going to touch, today, on
a few interesting subjects.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.470
First, we're going to see how
easy it is to build today a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.880
mobile web app that will work
actually quite nice on all the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.940
different mobile devices that
you can find out there.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.560
And we'll see how, with Google
Docs, and specifically Google

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.950
Spreadsheets and upscript, we
could create some nice server

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.560
side and actually share it with
other people that will be

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.110
responsible for updating
our content.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.520
So we'll get actually two
birds with one stone.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.090
We'll create the server
environment without any coding

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.740
quite quickly.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.730
We'll be able to put it up in
the air and share and control

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.500
the permission and everything
because, of course, it's

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.740
coming for free when you
are using Google Docs.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.750
But moreover, it's a very nice
and easy way for us to share

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.950
the content and to be able to
drive the mobile app through

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.280
this server side.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.330
The one nice thing that you
could do with it is to use the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.185
upscript, which is the
JavaScript glue, if you will,

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:19.790
to all Google products.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.880
And this will let you not only
automate a few of the tasks,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.090
but actually get a grasp of what
you could do with this

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.400
application.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.540
And in our case, I just choose
to do something nice with

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.080
Google Maps API since from
version 3.0 it's optimized for

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.290
mobile and will work quite
nicely on all mobile devices

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.860
and much faster.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.460
So without further ado, let me
just share my screen with you.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.160
And we'll go through these few
slides with lots of demos.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.900
So all these slides will be, of
course, up in the air on my

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.150
blog at greenido.wordpress.com.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.330
And of course, you have a link
here to the shows that we have

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.260
every Wednesday at 2:00
PM Israel time.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.430
So if you want to touch and ask
questions in the end of

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.130
the show, feel free.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.990
If you want to reach out to me,
both on G+ and Twitter, it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.270
will be greenido.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.450
And let me make it
even bigger.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.250
And of course, you could just go
to the blog itself and see

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.990
a summary of this talk and
all the show notes.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.030
So what we are going to do
today, we are going to look at

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.010
the mobile web app that I
did in the past 10 days.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.580
And we'll see some of the best
practices that you want to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.880
start and use when you're
building your own mobile web

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.680
page, site, or app.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.450
And of course, in this case,
we'll just use our server side

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.150
in Google Sheets and,
of course, bundled

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.290
in them, App Script.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.060
We're leveraging, of course, the
latest and greatest API in

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.840
Google Maps.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.330
And that, of course, will
guarantee that we are getting

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.350
good performances on
mobile devices.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.670
So how does it look like?

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.700
Well, it's in Hebrew.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.170
And that's actually
another aspect.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.600
When you want to do things here
it's just a demo app.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.482
So the route is in English, so
people could play around it.

00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:17.570
But internalization and
localization is something that

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.860
you do want to pay attention,
especially when you're

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.980
building mobile apps,
mobile web apps,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.660
and of course, sites.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.470
A lots of users are coming
from different countries.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.410
And you want to be able to make
them feel at home with

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.520
their own language.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.560
If you want to see some of the
best practices in design,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.560
development, debugging, and how,
basically, to work with

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.020
the mobile web, there's a nice
slides in this link that will

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.180
take you to all the
best practices.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.180
And of course, if you want to
see another dedicated talk

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.030
that I did with Riley a bit
earlier this year that, again,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.670
just focusing on the mobile web,
this is the link as well.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.950
Why I choose jQuery to build
this mobile on top of?

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.210
Because I see jQuery Mobile as
CSS frameworks that basically

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.590
save us lots of effort.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.990
They did a lot of work in
testing and making sure that

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.290
our site or app will look good
on all different mobile

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.730
devices out there.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.010
And of course, it's an HTML file
based UI that is built on

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.380
top jQuery and jQuery UI, so
you're getting lots of

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.540
development hours already
baked in for you.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.110
And basically, you are standing
on the shoulders of

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.320
giants, if you will.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.250
And saving you lots of work.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.540
This is how our app look like.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.420
And let's see a quick demo
of the app itself.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.690
So this is a live link, of
course, as you could see.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.070
And now, I just downloaded
the app itself.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.280
And you could see here a
few interesting things.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.570
If I'll open Chrome dev tools,
let's see if we could change

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.375
the app itself.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.240
And I'll make it bigger,
so everyone could see.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.420
Let's see how this app look
like on Android Nexus.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.340
So you see immediately
that I got the device

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.250
metric here for me.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.460
And this is more or less
how it will look like.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.320
If I'm enforcing it, you could
see now that I don't have here

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.020
the text, but I have
three dots.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.950
And that's, of course, coming
for free when I'm using this

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.320
CSS framework.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.020
And you could see that
all text is actually

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.000
in the right place.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.600
And the buttons are
still functional.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.690
By the way, those buttons will
open the [INAUDIBLE] mobile

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.530
app of Waze if you are getting
this mobile web app about from

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.620
a mobile device.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620
And I'll show you in a
minute how to do it.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.080
And it's actually a great
features for your users

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.480
because they don't need to click
on a link and then copy

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.500
it or do something
tedious with it.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.340
You just give them one button.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.140
And from this one button, they
will get the directions to the

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.790
place that they need to go.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.430
At the bottom of the page, we
have a full-blown Google map.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.620
We could zoom in.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.050
We could open and get more
information on the markers.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.000
And some nice buttons to the
official page if users want to

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.820
go and see it.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.040
Simple things like encapsulating
everything in

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.920
the real estate that you
have for your app.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.630
And making sure that you have
this notion of pages of

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:30.400
flipping and coming to life.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.030
Again, very, very easy to do.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.790
Let's now just have a quick look
at our code and see what

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.910
are the main aspects.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.990
So I'll open source.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.760
And here I'll just go
to our index file.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.070
And one of the things that you
could see here is that in the

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.750
metatag I'm making sure that if
the user is coming from IE,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.060
just to open a prompt frame.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.540
I'm making sure that the view
port will stay and the initial

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.620
scale will be one.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.240
And you could see more of why
we're doing it in the link

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.960
that I put on the first slide.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.355
And then just touching our CSS
here, the JavaScript, of

00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:15.580
course, will come at the
end of the page.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.340
And the CSS important, in this
case, because we want to use

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.550
the special CSS rules that
they already got for us.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.980
Here, we're using the
jQuery, of course,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.690
and the jQuery mobile.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.880
And we're using both of them
right here, so the app itself

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.620
will load and do all the
interesting stuff of styling

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.000
driven from jQuery
mobile itself.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.740
We're using Modernizer just make
sure that we do the right

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.550
things on different browsers--
a bit older browsers.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.880
And here we're just loading
the Google Map API.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.880
After that, we have
our own script.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.530
And actually as a best practice,
and as a nice to do

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.990
here, we need the styling to
put in another file, of

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.330
course, and separate HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.250
Here, we have these
organizational pages.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.995
So the first page just includes
here this table that

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:13.650
is actually a nice grid that
we're getting for free again.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:17.880
And we're just filling this grid
with our JavaScript API.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.220
And after that, we're just using
the map, as you could

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.540
see here, and making sure that
we are painting the map itself

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.340
on our map canvas and putting
the right markers in place.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.150
Let's see a bit of
the JavaScript

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.120
code that does this.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.220
So on the map itself, of course,
we want to take these

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.690
and put them under one object
and remove them from the

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.370
global scope.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.740
But here is just a little bit
of boilerplate code to

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.170
initialize the map.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.050
And after we're doing that, this
is the interesting part.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.960
And let's just make
it a bit bigger.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.140
So what we're doing here is
basically we're going to our

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.760
spreadsheet URL.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.670
And in each and every
spreadsheet URL that you have

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.640
in Google you have the ability
to publish it as

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.943
a feed to the web.

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:06.080
And in our case, I choose,
of course, to publish

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.800
it as an RSS feed.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.580
And then the nice tweak in the
end is just to put here alt

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.800
equals JSON instead of RSS.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.440
And you're getting it
as a JSON object.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.910
And then, all we to do is just
to get the JSON object.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.960
As you can see here, we're
getting the feed and we're

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.220
getting the data.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.780
And then it's just a matter of
a bit massaging the data and

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.280
making sure that we're
extracting the right things

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.390
and building the main table
in this one append.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.770
And you could see here the
results of this table.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.250
There's nothing more
than that.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.980
Later on, we're doing some
nice tricks like the map

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.880
should fit the bounds
of the markers.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.050
So we're just calling this.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:47.620
And again, with the great Google
Maps version 3.0 API

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.670
we're getting those
things for free.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.515
And of course, we're refreshing
the buttons that

00:09:55.515 --> 00:09:56.140
will take us.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.660
This is how we're adding
a marker to the map.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.460
And an info window, the info
window are those windows that

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:07.550
when we're clicking on them,
that's what you're getting.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.030
That's the code itself, very,
very simple and quite

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.520
straightforward.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.730
And as you could see here, when
our page is ready in the

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.480
mobile world, all we're doing is
calling the initialization

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.960
of the map and then fetching
the points from our server

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.835
side, which is a Google
spreadsheet.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.330
Why I use this server side?

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:40.100
Well, it's an easy CMS, a
content management system,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.745
that's giving you great
capabilities without and

00:10:43.745 --> 00:10:46.763
coding and without worrying to
security and other things that

00:10:46.763 --> 00:10:50.900
you'll have to do if you want
to put something in the air.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.360
Not to mention that in terms of
scale and performances it's

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.410
very, very nice to have it.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.160
Last, but not least,
is our API.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.900
So the APIs are quite generous
in the sense that we could

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:08.480
export those feeds and get it as
an XML, csv, RSS, Atom, and

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.510
more and more.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.310
And you could read more about it
and how you could work with

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.300
it and actually how to do some
clever things with the data

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.070
that you have on this
link at the bottom.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:28.370
Google Map API, we just covered
basic and very simple

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.270
code that we're using.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.070
But in this link here I just put
you a shortcut to all of

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.750
the various examples that you
have to work with Google Maps.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.080
And I highly encourage you just
to check them out because

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.920
they are very simple and very
powerful both if you are going

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.510
to do a native app or
a mobile web app.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.830
The nice thing about the Waze
web API is that it's nothing

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.110
more than a link.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.750
And you could see here, if I'm
just going and doing inspect

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.090
element on it, what
we have here is

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.820
basically just a button.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.485
And then the link to it--

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.600
As you could see here, this is
just the link that will make

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.480
our mobile web browser to open
the Waze native app and set

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.220
the point to this
geo location.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.470
So all you need to do is
basically just create this

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:28.950
shortcut link of Waze dot two.

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:33.480
And they're just giving it the
points that you want to do.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.350
Very, very simple and

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.630
straightforward and very useful.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.680
If there's any question and
answer, this is a great time

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:42.420
to ask them.

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.480
If not, be strong
until next time.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.950
And just feel free to reach
out to me on Google+ with

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.810
greenido or on Twitter
at greenido again.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.190
So thank you very much
and bye-bye.
