SUSAN WOJCICKI: And now I'd like
to invite Anna Patterson

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.960
to come up on stage.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.940
Anna Patterson has worked on
some of the biggest, most

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.020
ambitious projects I've seen at
Google, and she's going to

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.000
tell you a little
bit about them.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.260
Anna is Vice President of
Engineering and Artificial

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.200
Intelligence.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.400
What an amazing role
and opportunity.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.006
So let's please welcome
Anna onto the stage.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:27.500
Thank you.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.476
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.080
ANNA PATTERSON: So I'm here to
tell a little bit of hacker

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.310
stories from the trench, and I
think with a main theme of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.530
perseverance.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.330
I saw that the ENIAC
programmers, how they got a

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.590
circuit diagram in
order to program.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.640
My first programming job out of
school was for the F-15E,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.330
and we would test our software
the best you can on something

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.100
that wasn't flying.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
And then we'd invariably
need to put in patches.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.940
And just like the ENIAC, you had
to toggle in the program.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.240
So it was very scary since
people's lives were

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.400
depending on it.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.300
But also I was thinking
about how

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.550
source control has evolved.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.300
Of course, my first programs
in high school

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.600
were on punch cards.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.740
But at home, I was really
fortunate that my dad brought

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.650
home a Commodore Pet computer,
and he encouraged us to

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.990
experiment and write
a program on it.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.100
And I wrote a really, really
horrible, terrible video game,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670
and it only had 8K of memory.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.770
So I stored the program state
in the corners so they were

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.020
flashing weirdly.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.460
And, you know, I guess it was a
standard trick, I found out

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.630
much later.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.290
But I was from the suburbs of
Saint Louis, so I wasn't

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.430
really part of a burgeoning
hacker community.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.410
I eventually got my PhD in
computer science at the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.860
University of Illinois,
Champaign.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.590
And then I became a research
faculty member for John

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.140
McCarthy, the founder of AI.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.740
And I see several people here
who know me really well, and

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.340
so you'll appreciate when I say
that John McCarthy made me

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.820
do something how hard
that must have been.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.140
So he made me look into this
area called phenomenal data

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.250
mining, where you're given
facts and relations, and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.220
you're given a big data set.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.050
Big was very small
in those days.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.110
And then when you learn new
correlations, you can explain

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.170
these new correlations in
terms of underlying

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.460
phenomenon.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.040
So that's where it got its name
and that technique is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.420
still in use.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.580
But everybody was leaving the
department to start companies,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.550
so we were pretty much like
the last ones out when the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.160
lights were turning off.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.570
And I co-founded, in 1998,
a web mining company.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.300
Because the web was so big at
5 million pages, we thought,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.000
how are people going to be able
to get around this thing?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.300
And so we had an idea to make a
automatic taxonomy and kind

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.540
of lead people to what questions
were answerable on

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.520
the web and what ones weren't.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.910
Because in those days, trust
me, there weren't really

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.360
recipes on the web,
but the taxonomy

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.770
around Linux was deep.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.160
So we got angel funded to do
this just in time for the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.960
dot-com crash.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.720
And so I tried to figure out
what my other passion was, and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.050
I said, mobile is just
about to take off.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.410
So I moved into the mobile area
in 1999, just in time for

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.320
the telco crash.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.680
So after killing two industries,
I was actually--

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.170
I had a one-year-old, and I
was four months pregnant.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.990
And of course, I was unemployed
and I was actually

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.670
living in Pavni's guest room,
who's in the front row.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.019
And so the doctor said,
you know, you need

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.089
to be on bed rest.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.560
And I said, have you ever
heard of programming?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.079
And he hadn't.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.870
And I said, it's a lot
like bed rest.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.890
So I volunteered at the Internet
Archive, and they

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.790
have snapshots of the
web over time.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.340
So as such, especially
in 2001, it was much

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.100
bigger than the web.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.800
It had 30 billion web pages, and
the live web at the time

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.510
maybe had 5 billion.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.270
So I did a history-based search
engine that launched at

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.900
like, 12 billion pages, and you
could look at how terms

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.300
change over time.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.880
So you could dial back to 1997
and search for a term like

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.530
"Clinton," and you'd see all
these co-occurring terms in a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.700
graph and how they changed over
time, and it was very

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.120
presidential.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.030
Dialing it up to 1999, it wasn't
quite as presidential.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.120
And then moving forward to
today, everything is about

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.000
Hillary Clinton, if you search
for Clinton, when you look at

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.120
the popularity of the
things on the web.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.680
So it was a really interesting
project, and I was doing it as

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.100
a volunteer.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.060
And four days after it launched,
various companies

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.570
wanted to talk about
acquiring it.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.860
So I go from volunteer,
stay-at-home mom, to the world

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.010
of corp dev.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.900
So that was really fun.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.650
So that's how I wound
up at Google.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.620
And at Google, I really wanted
to unlock some global and

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.000
local information.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.650
One of our examples was about
these small towns in Germany

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.520
with their local Oktoberfests
and how that information was

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.970
really important to them.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.560
And we weren't quite
big enough to get

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.160
everything to everyone.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.510
And so at Google, we evolve our
system so just when one

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.440
system launches, we would
start a new one.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.700
So when one such system just
launched, I came up with the

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.090
idea for TeraGoogle.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.330
And speaking of thinking big,
probably 95% of people said,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.120
why would we ever need
a search system

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.320
for a trillion pages?

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.300
And of course, the founders
were like, is that all?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.580
So at the time, it was
very cost efficient.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.970
When it launched, it was about
50 times cheaper than our main

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.520
line index.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.450
And at the same time, some of my
web ranking team went off,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.880
and they shipped one of our
early deep-learning projects,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.690
which was around ads broadening,
like once you bit

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.180
on one keyword, what other
keywords do you--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.210
might be interesting.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.700
So after having my fourth child,
I did what everybody

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.790
does when they have four
kids, and they're

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.390
on maternity leave.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.640
I decided to start a company.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.810
So I started a company--

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.760
Cuil.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.440
And we really wanted to bring
like a really high-res, rich

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.560
experience to people with high
bandwidth, and a really low

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.420
bandwidth experience to people
who had feature phones.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.480
And so what we did around the
low bandwidth experience is we

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.430
summarized things so that a fact
that appeared on tons of

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.310
web pages was on top in kind
of paragraph format with a

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.690
bunch of references down to much
rarer facts that had much

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.690
fewer references.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.280
So after Cuil, I returned to
Google where I became one of

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.330
the first 100 engineers in
Android, because this time, I

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.020
was pretty sure the
mobile revolution

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.920
was going to happen.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.020
But it wasn't a sure thing.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.010
I mean, at that time, Android
had sold 40 million phones.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.090
And of course, today it was
announced that Android now has

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.700
900 million.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.720
I was part of the team that
helped launch Google Play on

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.140
Play tablets.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:05.170
And very recently, like two
weeks ago, we shipped a native

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.790
search architecture onto the
phone to index all the local

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.320
data so that when you're
offline, you can have access

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.190
to it, and some data never
leaves your phone.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.420
So a lot of people say, wait,
Google's so good at search.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.040
Why didn't you just compile
the thing and

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.450
put it on the phone?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.100
Well, the phone is kind of like
my early Commodore Pet

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.070
computer, not quite as bad,
but compared to a

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.960
data center, it is.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.520
And each of the programs can
only have 20 meg resident in

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.900
memory and the executable is 500
meg as hard constraints.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.169
So trust me when I say that
Google search system, its

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.500
executable is bigger
than 500 meg.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.270
So when we look at this system,
because of the success

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.630
of Android as a compute cluster,
it's actually over

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.660
500 exahertz of computing
power, which is way more

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.330
powerful than the human brain.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.360
So last autumn, I moved over
to our new AI area, where

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.550
recently Ray Kurzweil
joined us.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.120
And he says that the AIs that
humans create are going to

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.840
leave the Earth at light speed
and populate the universe.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.530
So we're not just working on the
most important project on

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.610
planet Earth, but
in the universe.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.400
So I do want to encourage the
Techmakers out there, women

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.100
and men, to really reach for the
stars and use technology

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.320
to help shape the world.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.040
Technology is a very powerful
platform in order to help

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.710
people and enable change.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.520
Thank you.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.770
[APPLAUSE]
