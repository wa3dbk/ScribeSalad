Hi, I’m Arne, from the Chrome Web Store
team. I’m here to talk about some of the

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:11.980
reasons we started working on the concept
of web apps for Chrome, and the ways that

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.170
you as a developer can get started writing
these apps.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.419
The idea for a web store grew out of an observation
that the way the web works has changed significantly

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.560
in the past few years. New standards such
as HTML5 give developers more flexibility

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.720
in the types of experiences the web can provide.
The pace of browser development has also sped

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.230
up, so these new features are shipped to end
users a lot faster than they were in the past.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.040
Developers have used these new features to
write increasingly sophisticated sites. So,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.110
the idea of a web site as a place to consume
text-based content has become out of date.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.850
Developers are writing websites to act as
real-time email clients, listen to streaming

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.170
music, and play multi-player games - functionality
that is traditionally associated with desktop

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.350
apps. Many of Google’s own services push
the limits of what can be done on a web page.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.239
Tools like Gmail, Docs and Maps are quintessential
web “apps” that use the browser as an

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.820
application platform instead of a content
renderer.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.329
We believe that the web has reached a point
where these kinds of apps are only going to

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.520
become more ubiquitous. &nbsp;We wanted to make
the experience of launching an app quick and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.670
direct, just like a desktop application.
So we’ve retooled Chrome’s New Tab page

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.499
to display a list of your most commonly used
apps as a series of big beautiful icons, so

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:30.280
that getting to the apps you love is as quick
as possible.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.229
A lot of the new HTML5 features like geolocation
and notifications help make apps very powerful

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.039
but at the same time require explicit permission
from the user. A complex app may need lots

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.579
of these features, which leads to a bad experience,
if the user has to click on a bunch of approval

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.030
boxes before being able to use the app. To
address this, we made apps require an explicit

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.249
“install” flow. &nbsp;When a user decides
to install an app, they will be presented

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.499
with the permissions that the app requires
in an easy to understand list. &nbsp;When they

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.600
approve the permissions, then the app will
be installed to and launched from the New

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.619
Tab page.
Finally, while we think Google search is the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.000
best way to find sites on the web, we understand
that users use many more metrics when selecting

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.819
apps to use. So we built the Chrome Web Store
as a dynamic gallery. Users filter apps by

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.650
category, read reviews and ratings and even
get personalized recommendations of apps to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.130
try.
The Chrome Web Store is integrated with the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.629
Chrome browser, so it it easy to access directly
from the New Tab page.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.900
It also offers an integration with Google
Checkout, so if an app requires payment to

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.950
use, the buying process is straightforward,
without the user needing to input a credit

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.570
card for each purchase.
One important point to note is that while

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.920
we added additional UI and functionality to
support apps in Chrome, we didn’t add any

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.620
additional proprietary APIs or technologies
to learn. Web apps in the Chrome Web Store

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.140
are built using the same standards-based tools
that you would use to create any other website.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.760
In fact, any website can be deployed as an
app simply by filling out a simple manifest

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.670
file and uploading it to the Web Store.
Apps that require payment can take advantage

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.640
of open technologies such as OpenID and OAuth
to interact with our license server, or they

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.290
can use any other existing payment or user
infrastructure if they wish.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.200
The key difference, then, is more about how
a web app should be designed, than how it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.400
is built. &nbsp;We expect web apps to deliver
a tight focus and a rich user experience.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.650
&nbsp;In this sense a web app in the store should
be more like a mobile application designed

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.060
for a larger screen, rather than a packaged
installable website. &nbsp;And because apps can

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.120
use all of the features supported by Google
Chrome, they can be fast, dynamic and powerful

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.860
without having to worry about legacy compatibility.
Hopefully this video has gotten you excited

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.030
to try creating a web app of your own and
posting it to the store. There’s an easy

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.739
learning curve to get started, and if you
already use a developer channel version of

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.409
Chrome and have a text editor, you have all
the software you need to get started. Just

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.850
visit code.google.com/chrome/apps to read
tutorials and documentation on building apps.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.510
Happy coding!
