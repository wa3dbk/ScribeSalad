00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.150
CHRIS WILSON: Hi.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.030
I'm Chris Wilson.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.670
I'm a Developer Advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.065
JAN LINDEN: And I'm
Jan Linden.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.620
I'm a Product Manager
on the Chrome team.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.230
CHRIS WILSON: And we're here
to update you with where we

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.380
are with Web Audio and some of
the exciting things that have

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.590
been happening there lately.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.330
I wanted to start by showing
a few demos that I've been

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.300
building over the past few
months and we'll get into some

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.910
of the new features
from there.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.200
So let's go take a look
at my computer here.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.780
And you can see I have
this web page up.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.030
It's webaudiodemos.appspot.com.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.610
This is kind of where
I dump everything.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.900
So it doesn't mean it's polished
or finished or great,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.400
but it's usually pretty
interesting at least.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.490
And probably the most exciting
thing since the last time we

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.390
talked, back in August, was
we have live input now.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.490
Like we can get a live audio
input into the web platform.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.050
So you may remember I did this
net little Vocoder application

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.620
that takes a sound, takes a
voice or any other sound, and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.670
Vocodes it.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.270
So you should be hearing,
hopefully, some--

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.431
[COMPUTERIZED VOICE]

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:47.160
CHRIS WILSON: There we go.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.890
And I built this back for Google
I/O before we had live

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.850
audio input.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.620
But the process it's going
through, this Vocoding process

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.710
of analyzing frequency bands
and applying those to a

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.910
different sound over time, it
actually works in real time.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.520
All of this is happening
in real time.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.120
So when we finally got live
input working, it actually

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.740
took me all of about half an
hour to get it up and running

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.670
on the Vocoder.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.630
I just had to put in a little
button to turn it on.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.040
And of course, we have to ask
if it's OK if we use your

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.770
microphone because we don't want
people spying on you or

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.070
listening in on you.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.650
But once you do that, you can
actually hear that I'm talking

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.090
into this and--

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.000
let's crank the gain up.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.720
It's a little weak here.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.480
There we go.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.180
And now, I can just give my
entire talk in the Vocoder for

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.410
the rest of the time.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.580
And mess around with
the pitch.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.930
JAN LINDEN: Please don't.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.370
CHRIS WILSON: Oh, OK.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.850
All right.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.620
I've been told that's not a good
idea, so we'll skip that.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.610
But kind of neat for the Vocoder
but this also means

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.780
it's quite easy to build
other applications.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.480
The next thing that I did was
immediately took a bunch of

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.730
the effects that we'd been
talking about, just things

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.671
like delay and reverb and
that sort of thing.

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:04.660
And made an application that
lets you switch between them

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.740
so you can hear what
they sound like.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.148
You can apply different
effects.

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:13.040
It's a little zoomed in here.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.370
And this also meant that I could
start playing with more

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.950
complex effects, things like
flanging or chorusing.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.990
And these effects actually take
a fair amount of plugging

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.780
together of audio nodes
and doing some

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.140
tricks with audio params.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.720
And there's also my personal
favorite, the octave doubler

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.310
effect where you can
hear a sub-octave.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.168
And which is an effect Chris
Rogers developed.

00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:42.555
[COMPUTERIZED VOICE]

00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:45.680
CHRIS WILSON: But this also
means you can do things like

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.250
audio recording directly.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.670
So I threw this app together.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.620
All it does is show a frequency
analysis of the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.030
current audio input.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.980
But at any point in time,
I can just say, I

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.920
want to start recording.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.780
So I click Record and I get
a little red button.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.990
And then when I'm done
recording, I can see a

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.300
waveform analysis.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.560
And I can download it to my
machine immediately and then I

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.300
have a wave file.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.730
I can play back the wave file--

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.110
Recording.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.490
So I click record
and I get a--

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.700
and you can tell it's
recorded the bit of

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.420
sound that I had there.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.770
This is a very, very small
chunk of code.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.140
All these, by the way, are up
on GitHub so you can go grab

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.880
the code and play around with
them and look at them.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.520
JAN LINDEN: So Chris, can you
explain how you record to disc

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.266
because that's actually
something that people have a

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:33.890
lot of questions about--

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.590
CHRIS WILSON: Yes it is.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.650
JAN LINDEN: --how to do that.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.080
CHRIS WILSON: So this is an
interesting one because this

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.780
is actually taking several
different pieces of code,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.380
several different library
functions and

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.870
plugging them together.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.550
The first one, of course, is
just grabbing user media.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.400
So getting a live input and
pulling it into an audio node,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.860
doing a frequency
analyzer on it.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.230
So I draw my own little
frequency analyzer at the top

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.130
of the screen that I pulled
from some other code.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.650
I wrote a library that does the
audio buffer display at

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.040
the bottom.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.870
But the real time recording part
is actually done using a

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.290
JavaScript node.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.260
And the JavaScript node
basically just sits there and

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.050
collects buffers and stacks
them together.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.920
And then when I say that I want
to download it, there's

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.300
actually a function in this
library that will encode that.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.010
This is a library called
Recorderjs

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.920
that's also up on GitHub.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.420
It's pointed to from my
repository for this app too.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.480
So you can go find it
and play with it.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.920
It only encodes into
wave file format.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.540
It doesn't do compression.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.020
It doesn't try to do bit
reduction or anything fancy to

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.260
try to get it into an MP3 file
or an Ogg Vorbis format or

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.010
something and do a little
bit better than that.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.320
That will come, I'm sure, but
it's going to take a little

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.925
bit of time to do good encoding
in JavaScript.

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:49.220
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.340
We can actually--

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.923
we'll talk about that a little
bit later when we come to some

00:06:52.923 --> 00:06:55.070
of the new stuff coming
in web audio API.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.855
But when offline mode
is coming that

00:06:56.855 --> 00:06:57.980
will help in order--

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:58.340
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.700
JAN LINDEN: --to do
these things.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.240
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.760
Yeah.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.470
This was an interesting
experiment, mostly because I

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.540
got to play around with moving
audio buffers around and

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.250
actually grabbing the bits out
of them and sticking them

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.260
together and that sort of thing,
which I hadn't really

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.050
played with much before.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.710
And let's see.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.460
That kind of gives you a good
idea of what you can do with

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.170
live input.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.990
The only other one that I
added live input to--

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:26.380
and this was actually
the first one-- is

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.630
apparently not there.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.690
Never mind.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.380
So I'll fix that after the show
and you can check out the

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.160
pitch detection.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.660
But basically just doing
analysis on an input and I

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.110
actually used a real time
analyzer to do that instead of

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.780
a JavaScript node.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.840
Although, it's a very, very
naive pitch detector.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.080
It's not something you
should really use.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.780
It can barely tune my
guitar into tune.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.530
Although, it does pretty
well with whistling,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.830
which was kind of cool.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.610
Apparently, I picked the right
test sample the first time

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.220
when I wrote it.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.620
But I wanted to talk too, in
general today, just about some

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.980
of the more advanced uses of web
audio that are starting to

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.090
solidify now that we've got a
pretty mature implementation.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.930
And we've been working through
a lot of the issues.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.620
For example, the chorus and
flanging effect that I have in

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.870
the live input demo.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.860
I originally wrote the chorus
and flange for Google I/O, and

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.550
then I had to pull it out at the
last minute because I was

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:29.780
sitting there like a week and
a half before the show

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.559
wondering why my code wasn't
working, why I wasn't getting

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:33.490
a chorusing effect.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.580
And finally, I went to Chris and
asked him to take a look

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.400
at my code and he dug through
it and he was like, huh, oh

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.650
yeah, we have a bug here.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.880
In the interim, it got fixed
so my code just kind of

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.860
started working and I had
another input effect.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.040
But when you start plugging all
of these things together,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.670
you can see sort of the power
of what you can do with the

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:57.920
Web Audio API.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.090
And I started saying, one of
the things that I really

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.960
wanted to-- the reason that I
really got into Web Audio was

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.740
I was interested in
synthesizers.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.190
I've always had a passion
for synthesizers.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.865
And so I started building
a synthesizer.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.030
This is kind of loosely based
on the Moog Prodigy

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.920
synthesizer architecture.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.140
It's not like a direct copy.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.740
It's not a re-creation.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.090
So don't rip on it too much
from that perspective.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.697
But I wanted to give something
where you could actually play

00:09:31.697 --> 00:09:35.550
notes in it and you could
control a bunch of different

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.040
parameters.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.826
So you can [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:41.380
filter and cut off and
things like that.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.590
And all of the modulation
effects and those sorts of

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.990
things work.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.365
And I actually had a ton
of fun building this.

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:50.620
It took me about a week
from beginning to end

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.040
to build this sample.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.260
And the interesting bit to me
was most of the time, actually

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.930
like 90% of the work that I did
here, 80-90%, was all user

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.130
experience.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.740
The Web Audio part was actually
very, very small.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.890
It was a small chunk of figuring
out how to do a

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.300
volume envelope the right way
and figuring out how to

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.870
connect the modulators
and things like that.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.500
JAN LINDEN: Did you have to make
any JavaScript nodes for

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.150
any special stuff?

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.340
CHRIS WILSON: I did
not actually.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.655
JAN LINDEN: You can do
everything in Web Audio

00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:18.930
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.450
CHRIS WILSON: You know, I think
the only application

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.140
that I built thus far that I had
to use a JavaScript node

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.350
for was the audio recorder
because it really needs every

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.630
bit, like it needs every
piece of information

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.250
that goes past it.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.340
The pitch detector, really if
I wanted to do super high

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:38.240
quality pitch detection, I
might switch over to a

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.410
JavaScript processor.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.930
But there is some latency
because going into the

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:48.520
JavaScript process is going
to introduce latency and

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.350
imprecision.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.660
But I thought this
was a ton of fun.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.400
But of course, the interesting
bit of Web Audio is how

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.410
programmable it is, how much
you can play with it.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.100
And I wanted to point out one
thing that I did was, after I

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.510
built this, I realized I spent
all this time building the

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.750
user experience and all these
knobs are just jQuery knob UI.

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.600
I didn't like hand code all
of the UI and you can tell

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.030
there's still some little bits
that don't look great.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.220
But I realized that one of the
parts I spent a bunch of time

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.590
on was just a voice architecture
for a synthesizer

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.740
and building the keyboard
and making it so you

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.600
can play it on screen.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.920
You can play it using the
computer keyboard.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.605
I have it plugged in with the
MIDI polyfill so I can play it

00:11:31.605 --> 00:11:34.420
with a little keyboard
that I have standing

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.295
over to the side here.

00:11:35.295 --> 00:11:37.260
It's off-screen.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.880
And then I can actually play it
and it sounds more like I'm

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.500
actually playing music.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.930
But I wrapped all that code
together and I have the super

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.530
simple version of this, the
template for a synthesizer,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.790
which you'll notice all
of the UI is missing.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.750
And you can still play
it the same way.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.810
But the interesting bit about
this one, is you can go in and

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.610
grab the code.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:07.100
And it just has a voice object
type and when a voice is

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.560
created, when I call new voice
every time, a new note gets

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.310
played, then it pulls in and we
have code right here that

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.130
can figure out what the
frequency needs to be.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:20.860
JAN LINDEN: Can you bump
the font up just one?

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.336
CHRIS WILSON: Sure.

00:12:22.336 --> 00:12:24.440
Let me pump it way up.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.020
Obviously, I was in deep
programming mode yesterday and

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.960
had it down a little bit.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.430
You can grab the frequency for
the note and then you just

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.070
create an oscillator
in this case.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.090
Or maybe you want to grab an
audio buffer and figure out

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.660
what playback rate
to set for it.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.940
But in this particular case, all
that I have is a sine wave

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.010
oscillator and then I create a
pretty standard attack, decay,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.650
sustain, release envelope
for it.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.300
And then at the end,
I call note on.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.590
And that's it.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.190
There's no other processing in
this particular synthesizer.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.180
It's a pretty straightforward
one.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.910
But if I wanted to make this a
sample playback synth instead

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.060
of creating an oscillator, I'd
create an audio buffer source

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.930
node connected to an audio
buffer, figure out what the

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:09.560
right playback rate was to get
it to play back at the right

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.770
frequency, and you're
off and running.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.510
So you can grab this synth
template, plug your own code

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.570
into the note on and note off
parts, and really easily get

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.330
up and running and have
something that's playable and

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.120
usable without having to go
build the actual onscreen code

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.472
and stuff like that.

00:13:28.472 --> 00:13:28.910
JAN LINDEN: Wow.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.490
Nice.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.090
CHRIS WILSON: And of course, the
other bit that I probably

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.565
ought to mention is I've been
working on making sure that

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:40.090
that works well on
iOS as well.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.670
I've got my iPad here.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:47.640
I have the same page up and
running and you can probably

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.030
hear it now.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.200
It plays the same way.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.750
So I put touch support into it
as well so you can get some

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.280
effects there, get some
additional device support.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.750
In fact, I think one of the
interesting things to me too

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:06.620
is seeing how touch and mobile
devices is going to affect Web

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.330
Audio as it rolls into there.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.910
The iOS implementation
is really good.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:14.060
It has some parts of it that are
still pretty challenging.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.150
I was talking with Jan right
before this about convolver

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.900
node is still pretty
iffy on iOS.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.700
I ran into some problems because
I was using it for

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.910
reverb on the synthesizer.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.070
But a lot of other apps are
really easy to build, and the

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.610
responsiveness of
having a touch

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.190
interface is pretty cool.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.970
I have one app in here that
is called Touchpad.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:40.300
It's really kind of like my
first mobile audio demo.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.190
All it does is it plays a sound
when you touch and as

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.220
you move around, it changes
filter parameters.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.150
So it changes the filter
cutoff frequencies.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.770
You drag down and it changes
the Q values.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.790
You drag across.

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:56.850
So you can kind of close the
filter and open it back up.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.520
And you can whirl around.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.540
I'm just going to carry
this around with me

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.500
when I go out at night.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:02.540
JAN LINDEN: [? You can annoy ?]

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.180
[? anyone. ?]

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:03.880
CHRIS WILSON: Soundtrack.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:04.500
Soundtrack.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.810
Yeah.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.970
JAN LINDEN: Excellent.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.010
CHRIS WILSON: So Yeah.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.270
I think one of the great things
to me is we're really

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:10.950
getting to the point--

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.390
I've been seeing a lot of other
people's applications

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:18.500
come out with Web Audio, in
Web Audio 2, and some

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.890
interesting new things.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.970
There's like Pedalboard.js,
for example, that does a

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.010
framework for building effects,
effects chains, and

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.990
pedal boards, really.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.620
It's kind of cool.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.930
JAN LINDEN: So you can just
hook up your guitar and--

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.740
CHRIS WILSON: You can hook
up your guitar and go.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.330
Yeah.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.870
I really should have brought my
guitar with me but then I'd

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.470
have to play it on camera and
that would've been kind of

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.080
embarrassing.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.186
But just plug in my guitar.

00:15:47.186 --> 00:15:48.740
I actually have a guitar--

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.090
I used to have a guitar in my
office all the time and then I

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.560
didn't for a long time.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.520
And now I've brought my electric
guitar into work and

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.210
it sits there all the time, just
to plug into Web Audio

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.470
and play around with it.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.550
Because sitting there and
playing through all of these

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.280
live input effects with an
instrument is pretty cool,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.550
even cooler than doing
the voice and things.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.160
JAN LINDEN: We should maybe talk
a little bit about on the

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.650
input on the latency
that you get.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.830
CHRIS WILSON: Definitely yes.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:16.410
Yes.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.320
So one of the things that has
really been a goal then for

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.540
the whole time has been
super low latency.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.930
That was one of the things that
I know it was frustrating

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.570
to me for a long time because I
really wanted live input but

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.540
the engineering team, and
Chris in particular, was

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.920
really passionate about having
super low latency, like

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.890
musically useful audio input,
rather than just something

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:45.780
that you can get audio input but
you might have a lag time

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.610
of over 10 milliseconds or 20
milliseconds or things that

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.870
aren't super useful when you're
trying to play a guitar

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.440
through it.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.210
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.750
I actually did some measurements
recently and you

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.620
can get down to five
milliseconds from microphone

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:06.339
in to speaker out, with pretty
standard hardware.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.890
And if you just use your Mac
without any USB device or

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.480
anything, you can--

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.670
on my Mac, I got it to
nine milliseconds.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.220
CHRIS WILSON: That's
pretty good.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.280
JAN LINDEN: That's
very useful.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.460
I mean it's like having
a speaker nine

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.650
feet away from you.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.280
CHRIS WILSON: Right.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.740
JAN LINDEN: That's
very manageable.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:29.720
CHRIS WILSON: It's really nice
to have such good feedback and

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.340
such low latency and be able to
do something that's, like I

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.160
said, musically useful.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.670
That's one of the exciting
things to me has been just

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.380
working with such a low latency
API, although it ends

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.110
up bringing up new challenges
too and you have to come up

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.770
with new architectures.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.620
Like one of the things that I've
been talking with people

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.040
a lot about lately has been
the concept of scheduling.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.190
And scheduling musical notes as
well as Web Audio and then,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.610
of course, web MIDI
events as well.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:05.580
And the idea of how you would go
about building a system so

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.770
that you sort of schedule ahead
on the high precision

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.200
timer because you don't have
events in the Web Audio space,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.220
in the Web Audio time
I should say.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.300
Like you can't say, call me back
at precisely this number

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:20.810
of microseconds, basically,
because JavaScript doesn't

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.620
have that kind of level of
precision in its eventing

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.700
system either.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.630
So you have to sit there and
say, you know what, I'm going

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:31.790
to set an interval timer and
every 30 milliseconds I'm

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.760
going to call back, or even
less than that, every 15

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.260
milliseconds, which JavaScript
can usually handle, I'm going

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.310
to go play the next 20
milliseconds of events and set

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.900
them up in the Web Audio
event queue, or

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.570
the MIDI event queue.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.210
I think those sorts of
architectures are still coming

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.530
and I'm working on a demo for
that but I don't quite

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.060
have it done yet.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.040
JAN LINDEN: Since you mentioned
MIDI, I know another

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.670
very passionate thing for you
is to get the APIs for that.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:04.430
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.360
Yes.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.920
Yeah, so MIDI is sort of the way
that you hook up musical

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.690
instruments, controllers.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.310
I have a whole pile
of controllers

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.220
on my desk at work.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.265
People always stop by and say,
what do you do here anyway?

00:19:17.265 --> 00:19:20.490
It's because I have all these
weird things sitting there.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.370
And it's also used for things
like lighting systems and

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.400
other things as well.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.200
But it's not just I have this
professional synthesizer that

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.940
I want to connect anymore.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.840
And to me, when I first started
looking at Web Audio

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.780
here, the thing that immediately
was obvious to me

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.630
was that it was super
powerful.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.220
You could create these really
rich musical applications

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.780
except the inputs were still
like go click on something

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.400
with a mouse or go drag
this slider and I was

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.740
like, that's horrible.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.700
I can't stand it.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.540
I like having physical things to
touch and move around, and

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.670
knobs and buttons and things.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.650
And MIDI is the way
to do that.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.950
So I immediately said, OK, how
do we go about adding MIDI to

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.940
the web platform.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.990
And I became the co-editor
of the specification.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.840
We now are in our second
public draft.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.285
It's getting pretty stable.

00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:14.660
We've still got a few open
issues but we did bounce at

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.530
zero issues for awhile there.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.610
And we're looking to get some
native implementation.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.230
But I also wrote a polyfill for
it that uses a plug-in on

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.280
OS X and Windows.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.380
And the plug-in basically allows
you to include this

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.690
JavaScript library and then just
act as if the web MIDI

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.850
API is there.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.630
So you can listen
for MIDI events.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:40.680
You can grab on to different
devices, send MIDI outputs if

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.940
you want, that sort of thing.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.810
So it really helps unlock the
power of Web Audio to me,

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.610
particularly with things
like the synthesizer.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.440
I mean, it's really hard, even
with the computer keyboard,

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.710
which is a physical button, to
play anything that's really

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:56.790
expressive.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.570
But of course, I can play it
pretty expressively on my

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.680
keyboard here.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.270
And because this was a
replication of an old analog

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.120
synth, it didn't have a ton of
controllers or anything.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:12.120
I haven't yet done things like
velocity responsiveness and

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.190
the controller responses
and that sort of thing.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.030
I have some of the
things hooked up.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:17.630
You could tell.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.450
You can play with the filters
in real time,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.700
that sort of thing.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.120
Yeah so that's kind of the
lap around the newer

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.000
stuff that we have.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.290
JAN LINDEN: So let's talk
a little bit about

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.520
what's coming up next.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.440
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.890
JAN LINDEN: So a few things I'm
aware of is the engineers

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.710
are working on an offline mode,
which means that you can

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.170
do processing not in real time,
faster than real time if

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.460
you want to or sometimes slower
than real time if it's

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.050
really complex.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.260
And that, as we mentioned, will
help you in doing, for

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.500
example, encoding before
you dump something.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.220
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.020
It's also nice for when you're
building digital audio

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.660
workstation type software
because you can apply an

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.970
effect and then just grab the
audio buffer if you want to

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.468
save it and not have to try to
do everything in real time.

00:22:09.468 --> 00:22:10.902
JAN LINDEN: Yep.

00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:11.380
That's a nice one.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.540
CHRIS WILSON: I saw that there
had been a sort of trial

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.200
implementation of that under
the covers in Chrome for

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.280
awhile, but Chris added that to
the Web Audio specification

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.990
too so you can read up on
how to do it and go

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.280
play with it in Chrome.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:25.690
JAN LINDEN: Yeah.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:29.580
And there is a new spec
coming out pretty

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.260
soon, I think as well.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.220
And then the other big thing and
the input is part of this,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.350
so input is done by hooking up
to the get user media, which

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:45.720
is part of the WebRTC efforts,
and there is a lot of effort

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.760
going on to hook up WebRTC and
Web Audio in other ways so you

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.100
can actually take the input or
the output from a Web Audio

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.142
and connect that to WebRTC and
then, for example, if you have

00:23:00.142 --> 00:23:02.920
a video conference going on,
then you can apply all these

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.830
cool effects and then
send it over there.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.250
And likewise, the next step is
on the receiving side, then

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.670
you can do the same thing or do
analysis or do spatial or

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.900
whatever you want to do on
the receiving things.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.330
CHRIS WILSON: For a while, I've
wanted the ability to

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:23.370
just hack into my Hangout and
apply Web Audio effects, if

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.260
for no other reason than
taking that dynamics

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.590
compressor and applying it to
everyone in the room because

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.690
I'm on a lot of teleconferences
with people

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.910
from different locations and
invariably half of the group

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:38.850
is in a conference room
somewhere and they're very

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.940
quiet and you have to listen,
crank your volume up, and then

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.950
there's the one guy who's
sitting with a microphone

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.513
right on his lips and jumps in
and blasts everybody out.

00:23:48.513 --> 00:23:48.866
JAN LINDEN: Yep.

00:23:48.866 --> 00:23:51.700
CHRIS WILSON: It would be nice
to kind of tone that down just

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:52.590
a little bit.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.930
But yeah, it's going to
be really exciting.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.930
I can't wait to sort
of start applying--

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.950
doing all my Hangouts
in Vocoder mode

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.306
or things like that.

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:02.210
That would be kind of cool.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.260
JAN LINDEN: Great.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.400
CHRIS WILSON: So
yeah, I think--

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.250
did we have any questions to
answer from the queue?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.500
I can't remember.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.700
One second.

00:24:18.553 --> 00:24:29.320
[SYNTHESIZER PLAYING]

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.070
MALE SPEAKER: So we
do have a couple

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.940
questions on the moderator.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.490
So let's go ahead and
get ready for those.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.260
One of them asked about
performance.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.140
How much will the difference in
implementation on different

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.340
operating systems make?

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.630
For example, a tablet
or smartphone.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.660
And then second, obviously some
operations require more

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.560
power than others.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.805
What are the dangers in the
current implementations?

00:24:48.805 --> 00:24:50.020
CHRIS WILSON: Good,
good questions.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:50.710
Yes.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.580
So of course, there are going
to be differences in

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.670
performance on different
pieces of hardware.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:57.600
We see that today.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:02.270
Even depending on what audio
hardware you have, you can get

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.950
different latency, particularly,
but even so,

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.130
you'll see a difference in
processing if you have to do a

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.786
lot of conversions for buffers
and things like that.

00:25:11.786 --> 00:25:15.370
JAN LINDEN: You'll really have
to optimize hard to get it to

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:20.160
run well on the mobile
processes, for example.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.720
And that's definitely room
for improvement there.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.670
As you mentioned,
the convolver--

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:24.810
CHRIS WILSON: Of course.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.350
JAN LINDEN: --node is not quite
working as you would

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.635
like it to on iOS yet.

00:25:31.635 --> 00:25:36.720
But the combination of faster
processes coming out there and

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.740
more optimization will
see that improve.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:44.740
But it's definitely a very
important thing and today, it

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.310
won't run perfectly
on every scenario.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.650
CHRIS WILSON: No.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.180
No, of course not.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.800
JAN LINDEN: And then operating
system also has an impact,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.310
like doing things in Mac and
Windows is slightly different

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.660
and there are things
that can be done.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.160
Typically, we get better
performance on Mac but still

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.930
really good on Windows,
especially when we can use

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.300
certain modes there.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:11.300
And then Linux is obviously a
little bit more spread in what

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:12.260
you can get.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:12.970
CHRIS WILSON: Of course.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.670
And mobile as well.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:21.270
The spread in hardware in mobile
is just so broad, even

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.230
outside of Web Audio,
of course.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.450
JAN LINDEN: But the basic
effects that you really need

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.170
for doing gaming, et cetera,
if you don't want to go too

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.390
far, you should be able
to do a lot of that.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:35.560
CHRIS WILSON: One of the
things that has been

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.730
fascinating to me to understand
has been one of the

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.390
big values of Web Audio is
simply cracking apart that

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:46.990
process of downloading,
decoding, and playing audio

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:51.940
files because with the HTML5
audio element, that's all

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.910
wrapped together.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.060
Like you can play separately
but it's not--

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.880
JAN LINDEN: You can't
really do anything--

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.600
CHRIS WILSON: --really
a low latency play.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.830
And the download and decode
is all wrapped together.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.150
And at least you can crack those
apart and just the value

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.870
of being able to control
when those steps

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:07.480
happen is pretty important.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.720
And then, when you're building
gaming or even just like

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.200
interactive sound for an
application, making little

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.020
beeps and boops when you roll
over things or select

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.070
different options or whatever,
that's actually really

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.930
lightweight in terms of what
you're doing with Web Audio

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.690
but it's very effective in terms
of giving feedback to

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.770
the user and having a more
immersive experience.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.030
Then there's, of course, the
whole processing pipeline and

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.740
even doing some basic effects
can be pretty easy.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.920
But once you start trying to
really crank out a lot of

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.120
nodes together--

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.650
I was kind of fascinated that
Vocoder actually worked when I

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:45.940
first implemented it, because
when that's running in real

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.310
time, it has about 400 audio
nodes of various kinds active

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.840
all the time and processing all
the time, which I was sure

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.570
it was just going
to fall over.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.940
But it was doing OK except every
once in a while as I was

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.110
practicing my I/O slide deck,
I would discover that it

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.920
wasn't working quite as
well as I thought.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.290
It sounded a little noisy.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.120
It wasn't really glitching
but it was kind of

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.800
crackling or something.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.490
And then I realized that I was
using the speaker notes mode

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.440
and it was actually
instantiating it twice.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.810
And it only happened when I was
like triggering it from

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.310
the MIDI keyboard that it was
running both of them at once.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.260
But it was basically setting up
800 nodes and running them

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.670
all at once on my poor
little MacBook Air.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:30.400
JAN LINDEN: So you
still have to be

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.280
careful what you're doing.

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.920
CHRIS WILSON: You still have
to be pretty careful what

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.820
you're doing.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.110
But I think for a lot of the
basic things, it's actually

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.170
not that complex.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:42.040
And if you look at things like
the synthesizer that I built,

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.380
for example, it's actually not
doing a lot with audio nodes.

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.170
It is doing some pretty
solid processing.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.240
I need to go back and play with
it more in iOS now that

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.740
I've sort of narrowed down that
the convolver is causing

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.670
a challenge for us.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.820
But I think that, in general,
you'll see performance will

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.410
continue to improve and
be easier to manage.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.270
On the power issue, power to me
is really very related, in

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.900
this case, to performance
and memory

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.110
usage as well, of course.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:15.240
But I think that the fewer nodes
you can get away with,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.060
the more lightweight you can
make your application, the

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.950
better you're going to be.

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:20.940
But I don't think you're
going to see some kind

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.380
of huge power drain.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:22.970
JAN LINDEN: No.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.850
And when you look at these
devices, typically nothing

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.080
gets close in power consumption
to the display and

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:30.720
everything so--

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.110
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:36.050
JAN LINDEN: --it very often
drowns in that.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.840
But of course, if you're running
at full speed for a

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.970
long time, that will have
an effect on power.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.615
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:29:42.615 --> 00:29:43.910
So our next question.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:48.780
Jeff wants to know, how he can
make simple onsite effects,

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.370
for example, distortion or
pitch with only one user

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:56.010
adjustable parameter that the
user could activate for

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.010
streaming music on the site.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.670
And in terms of page load speed,
what would be the best

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.890
practice for doing this?

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.090
CHRIS WILSON: One effect
with one parameter.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.360
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.740
So apply one effect to
some music that's

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.120
playing on your site.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.080
And what would be the best way
to go about doing that?

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.330
CHRIS WILSON: OK.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.630
Applying one effect at a time
and giving a small set of

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.590
parameters, it's kind of similar
to the audio input

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.850
effects demo that I built which
I've meant to come back

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.930
to and make it a little more
componentized, but I think

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.230
that it's a pretty good example
of how to plug in a

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.240
single effect and let you
play around with a

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.570
parameter or two.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:46.150
The one challenge is music
playing back on the site.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.660
If you don't control the site,
even if you can inject

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.690
JavaScript, you can't always
grab control, like grab that

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.680
audio stream.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.480
You can't grab an audio
stream off of a

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.060
Flash object, for example.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.330
JAN LINDEN: But if
it's playing in

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:02.550
an HTML5 audio tag--

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.360
CHRIS WILSON: Or even a video
tag you can then--

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.540
JAN LINDEN: --then you can just
use that as an input node

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.950
to Web Audio and then you can do
whatever you want with it.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.180
CHRIS WILSON: Yep.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:12.930
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.100
And Lincoln from Miami wants
to know, he'd like to use

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.610
filters on real time audio
capturing from the microphone.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:24.210
Is it possible and do you
have a demo for it?

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.360
CHRIS WILSON: So real time
filtering of audio input.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.160
Actually, yeah.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.520
There's--

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.590
JAN LINDEN: It's one of the--

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.990
CHRIS WILSON: That's one of the
effects on the live input

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:42.750
effects demo is an
LFO filter that--

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.700
this actually runs it on
a [COMPUTERIZED VOICE]

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.950
low frequency oscillator.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.840
You know, actually, telephone
effect is a good one too.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.230
You can tell it's making my
voice a little bit clipped

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.840
here but let's flip
to the LFO one.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:02.780
Well.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.910
The telephone demo is a good
place to start just because

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:10.460
all it does is take the user
input audio and it runs it

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.200
through two filters.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.970
One to mask off the low
frequencies and one of mask

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.530
off the high frequencies.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.580
And so you only get the middle,
which is typically

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:23.730
what a telephone does.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.030
And the LFO filter, on the other
hand, has this kind of

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:30.810
weird bouncing effect where
it's using a low frequency

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.010
oscillator to control the
frequency cut off of a low

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:35.160
pass filter.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.510
So if you listen to yourself
through it, you'll actually

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.160
hear it kind of bounce
in and out.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.320
JAN LINDEN: So that shows how
you can vary it in real time.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.940
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:48.410
And that's actually a
really good topic.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.040
It's one that I'm going to
come up with some more

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.220
tutorials on and some videos on,
is doing that sort of real

00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.030
time effects control using audio
node routing into audio

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.990
parameters, which I think is
super powerful and not very

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.680
well understood.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.687
In fact, I was talking to one of
my coworkers yesterday who

00:33:07.687 --> 00:33:09.280
has done a bunch of Web
Audio stuff and he's

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.750
like, you can do that?

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.490
I'm like, well yeah.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.060
That's how you do chorus and
flange and these other effects

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:18.885
that you need to have audio rate
controls over things on.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.160
MALE SPEAKER: That's all
the questions we

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.320
have time for today.

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:25.850
CHRIS WILSON: OK.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:26.165
Great.

00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:26.480
JAN LINDEN: Excellent.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.610
CHRIS WILSON: Well I think we'll
close there and until

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.380
next time, that's Web Audio.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.630
JAN LINDEN: Thank you.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:56.267
