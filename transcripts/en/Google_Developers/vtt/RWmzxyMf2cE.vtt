COLT MCANLIS: Hello everyone.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.440
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.660
I am the team lead for the
performance section of Chrome

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.890
Developer Relations.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.550
And tonight, I want to talk to
you about the joys of static

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.680
memory JavaScript.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.500
Now, I'm going to let you know
that I gave a great talk at

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.570
the HTML5 DevCon earlier this
year in April, and I had a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.010
little section in my talk
about static memory

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.490
JavaScript.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.509
And bar none, the most questions
I got was about

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.820
static memory JavaScript.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.090
And so I actually went back,
and I actually wrote this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.610
presentation a couple
months ago.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.790
And I was very happy that Peter

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.490
allowed us to do it tonight.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.270
But it was really interesting,
because when we tried to get

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.150
this thing together, really,
it was a one-off shot.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.310
We had to get the guys from
Europe in town, and they only

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.630
had availability for a window.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.840
And then we had to figure out
what day of the week we had

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.850
availability for Google's
facilities and catering and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.870
all this other crazy stuff.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.900
And it was the most random shot
in the dark for us to end

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.310
up on September 19.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.570
Now, I'm in a room
full of nerds.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.280
Does anyone know what
September 19 is?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.735
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:12.330
AUDIENCE: Talk like
a pirate day.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.660
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr!

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.760
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.340
COLT MCANLIS: Now, I'm a very
simple man, and I had to stand

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.740
in the mirror a couple of days
ago, and I had to ask myself

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.470
how much of a man I was if I
could take this opportunity to

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.340
give a talk on the most random
shot day to be able to give a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.320
talk in front of a roomful of my
fellow nerds, and actually

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.865
do the entire thing
as a pirate.

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:43.300
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.040
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.590
COLT MCANLIS: My wife didn't
believe this was possible.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.560
I showed it to her on Google
that this was a thing.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.410
And so I'm going to ask you
tonight, can we do this?

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.960
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.100
COLT MCANLIS: Listen,
ya bilge rats!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.410
I'm asking ya can we do this?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.520
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.260
COLT MCANLIS: One more time.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.790
We've been giving
ya free booze.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.195
Give it to me again!

00:02:06.195 --> 00:02:07.045
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:02:07.045 --> 00:02:08.710
COLT MCANLIS: Arr, now
that's the crew I be

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.370
looking to have tonight.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.730
Aye.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.500
Now, tonight we be talking about
one thing in common.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.480
We be slaying the
waste monster.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.150
Its vile tentacles be keeping
your applications

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.140
from going too fast.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.240
I lost me leg and
got a new one.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.490
That's why I hate it.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.490
My name is Captain Main Roach,
and I'm here not to save your

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.340
bodies, because the monster
be taking those.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.530
I'm here for your souls.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.900
Well, the applications' souls.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.740
I really don't care about you.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.100
But we need a refund on the--

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.250
I'll get to my point.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.400
If you be hearing anything
from Captain Main Roach

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.080
tonight that you want to be
tweeting, make sure you be

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.950
using the right hashtags,
because we had

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.050
those back in the day.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.990
And also, be making sure that
you visit our web performance

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.540
group on Google+.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.050
It be a great place for
a bunch of mootin--

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.150
mootineers?

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.235
That came out wrong.

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:00.520
All right.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.860
This is a little
well-rehearsed.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.070
Make sure you visit it.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.500
Sign up at goo.gle/webperf.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.630
Now, listen here,
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.630
yellow-bellied dogs.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.220
I'm not here to listen to you
wallow and wane about whether

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.220
or not you like the JavaScript
garbage collector.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.740
I'm here to tell you that it be
a vile beast that be taking

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.710
everything from ya.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.150
Because as it does its evil
task, it's going to be taking

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.380
away a little bit of your
framerate every single time.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.640
And I'm not here to
debate your dogma.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.800
I dinnae care what gods you
[INAUDIBLE] to, be that of

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.440
managed memory, or
static memory, or

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.030
dynamic, anything else.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.610
I'm here to worship one god
alone, and that be the one of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.190
application speed.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.170
Can you say arr?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.112
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:44.525
COLT MCANLIS: One
more time, arr!

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:45.000
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.585
COLT MCANLIS: Aye, application
speed!

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.400
So stow your noise tonight.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.770
I won't be debating whether or
not JavaScript's the best

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.200
language or the worst
language.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.400
But I'll be telling you how to
make your applications fast,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.650
because that's why
you're here.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.421
Aye?

00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.343
AUDIENCE: Aye.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.265
COLT MCANLIS: Aye.

00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:02.150
You're learning.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.780
That's good.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.100
So I'll tell you the trouble
with memory.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.040
Now, many of you may not be
versed in the wild seas of

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.270
sailing around memory
problems.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.980
But I'll tell you,
I've been there.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.520
I lost me hair and me family.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.220
It be a vile place to be.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.420
From the depths of Hell, memory
management come and it

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.589
take everything in your life.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.620
I'm here, but a husk of a man,
trying to make sure you do not

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.960
follow the same path.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.080
Let's tell you why.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.490
So when you're out sailing with
your buccaneers, having a

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.610
good time writing your web
applications, sooner or later,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.050
one of you's going
to drop dead.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.790
In your web application, one of
them will be running around

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.600
allocating memory or adjusting
the Dom, and sooner or later,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.310
it'll have one too many
pints of beer and die.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.060
We're pirates.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.640
It happens.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.640
But now I tell you this.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.410
Its corpse won't go away.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.190
No, your crew have better things
to do than remove it.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.130
Instead, you'll leave it on the
ground festering when the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.850
rats come and pick at its bones,
and the gnats come and

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.310
lay in its eye sockets,
and the gulls come and

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.730
feast on its flesh.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.970
And only then, only then, when
the monster gets a whiff of

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.240
the piles of corpses that you've
been leaving around in

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.090
your application, only then
will it summon its bulbous

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.700
arms to your poop deck.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.860
Poop deck joke, that's good?

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.340
Poop deck?

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.160
We're in poop deck jokes.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.410
OK.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.030
And when this beast come and
find your vessel, it dinnae

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.920
know who's living
and who's dead.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.710
It's a blind beast filled
with hate and rage.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.970
It'll bring its tentacles up
aboard your vessel, and it'll

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.860
sniff every one of your crew
to figure out which one be

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.460
inactive and which one still
be on the stack ready to be

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.750
used again at a future date.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.270
And when it finds its evil prey
that it be eating on,

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.730
it'll take it away from you.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.280
And only then will your dinghy
be operating at peak

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.370
efficiency now that all the
corpses have been hauled away

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.385
on your behalf, you
lazy captain.

00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:04.450
But I tell you this, the
beast takes away

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.650
as much as it giveth.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.190
Because your schooner be going
fast on its mission.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.060
It be hitting 60 knots
per second.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.660
Everyone knows that's the
magical speed of a boat.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.980
And as it be going at 60 knots
per second, all of a sudden

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.430
those piles of corpses will rise
high, and you'll hear it.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.545
You'll hear the vile beast
coming from afar, its hate and

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:27.760
its dread and its demon-filled
life

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.080
coming aboard your vessel.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.020
And it'll stop you.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.880
And it'll take away those knots
and stop you to zero.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.240
And all of your men aboard your
ship will stand idly and

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.140
wait for it to do its
demon-filled task.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.630
Meanwhile, your users are
standing there asking why your

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.350
ship is not moving.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.170
And you can't be like, it's
the monster, it's not me,

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.750
because they blame
the captain.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.470
And then you get fired, and
you have to talk like

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.870
a pirate all day.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.800
And when it's done with its
deadly task, it'll let you on

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.880
your way, only to catch you
again in the future.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.210
This be the cycle that it lives
and breathes off of,

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.680
your reluctancy to allow the
corpses to lay around, because

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.960
you've got better things
to do, like CSS.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.500
Arr, I be a ventured pirate from
back in the days of C++,

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.730
where a man had to manage his
own memory and his, you know,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.860
stack overflows and threading
problems and kernel issues.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.960
But it be a simpler time then.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.580
We didn't really have
user interfaces.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.980
It was mostly command prompt.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.136
Moving on.

00:07:31.136 --> 00:07:34.010
And what you be needing to know
is that this monster can

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.890
strike at any time, any
time it chooses.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.860
It doesn't matter what you
think it should be doing.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.750
It's going to do
what it wants.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.240
Be it in a call back handler or
when the frame is updating,

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.590
any time your JavaScript-style
dinghy be floating on the

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.730
water, it'll rear its ugly
head as it sees fit.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.770
And you should know that the
most important thing about

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.080
your vessel is that it
stays constant at

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.460
60 knots per second.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.350
It doesn't care what you want.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.470
It clears for the flesh
it's come to claim.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.480
Aye?

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.400
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.800
COLT MCANLIS: I see some
scared in the house.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.610
They're like, where is
he going with this?

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.470
Are we talking about
memory or fishing?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.870
I'm really unclear right now.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.550
Don't worry.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.800
It'll come down.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.250
Now, here is a great
chart, lads.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.560
You yellow-bellied sea bedders
may be looking at me and

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.770
going, listen to this angry man
who be thinking garbage

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.920
collection's a bad thing.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.330
I'm a friend with that beast.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.180
We go drinking on
Friday nights.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.820
No, it is not your friend.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.570
It's just using you for free
drinks on Friday nights.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.760
I've been there once--

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.960
we'll talk about that later.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.169
If you get nothing from me
diatribe this evening, I want

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:42.830
to be remembering this one.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.330
This is a map built by the
most evil and satanic of

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.970
scientists.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.600
They've followed this
beast around.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.420
And what you be looking
at here is two

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.920
distinct groups of lines.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.540
The first group is done by the
responsible captains who send

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.200
their crew to the evil task of
managing the dead themselves.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.950
Now, aye, it does take a little
bit more memory for the

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.760
captain to ensure that the crew
is doing the right thing,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.440
tossing its shipmates
overboard.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.600
But you can see on the other
side is the one where the

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.850
kraken, the evil corpse
monster, be doing

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.140
the work for you.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.770
Now, these lines mean
nothing right now.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.010
But I'll tell you what
they do show.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.240
On the bottom line here, these
numbers chart out how much

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.430
memory the system has relative
to the application that be

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.720
running-- oh, for your nautical
folk, how big the sea

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.310
is compared to the size
of your ship, aye?

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.760
Aye?

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.720
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.980
COLT MCANLIS: Aye!

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.020
More beer, aye.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.380
Now, what you be seeing here is
three distinct areas that I

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.480
wish to be pointing out this
evening, because you'll find

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.670
the treasures soon, aye.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.440
First is you see the bad zone.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.220
If your memory is between two
and four times the size of

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.270
your vessel, ye be screwed.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.500
[LAUGHS]

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.080
You want to know why?

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.630
Because this kraken beast,
this hate-filled demon

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.900
vile-covered spawn monster
be larger than you think.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.550
And when the body of water that
your schooner be floating

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.930
in be small, it has nowhere to
put its hefty load of lard, so

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.470
it must put it upon your
vessel, all the

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.092
way on the poop deck.

00:10:19.092 --> 00:10:20.300
You asked for more
poop deck jokes.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.390
I'm going to give them to you.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.752
You have to laugh now.

00:10:22.752 --> 00:10:23.160
AUDIENCE: Ha.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.595
Ha.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:25.810
Ha.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.840
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr,
pity laugh.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.520
Now, when you end up in this
second region here, you're

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.410
doing a little bit better.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.470
You can see that four to six
times the size of your memory

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:37.420
requirements, arr, you be about
average compared to what

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.970
your crew be doing manually.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.540
This is about the sweet spot on
mobile devices today, these

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.220
little devices that they have
that track all of your

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.250
movements and your going about
eating your food and

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.260
plundering and pillaging and all
you're pirate ways, right?

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.880
This is where you be sitting
with your memory.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.690
But unfortunately, that's not
where the sweet spot be for

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.570
your vessel.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.100
Nay, your ship needs to be in a
wide open ocean, between six

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.740
and ten times the amount of
memory that your application

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:04.560
be needing.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.400
And it's only then when you'll
start to see the hates from

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.120
this vile corpse monster
actually be mitigated, because

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.810
the water is able to hold its
massive rolls of flesh-eating,

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.142
corpse-filling, bile-drinking
fat.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.670
Unless you're here,
ye be screwed.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.480
So make sure that your
JavaScript-class schooner

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.860
knows what the size of the
water be going in.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.090
If you remember nothing,
remember this graph tonight.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.330
Arr.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.560
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.280
COLT MCANLIS: Now, I will tell
you, there be one vessel on

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.630
the seven seas that seems to
escape the corpse monster many

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.750
times, and in fact, many have
said that it be the fastest

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.910
JavaScript vessel in
all the world.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.320
It is known as the
SS Emscripten.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.760
Do you know the vessel?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.000
AUDIENCE: Aye.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.210
COLT MCANLIS: I said, do
you know the vessel?

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.010
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.390
COLT MCANLIS: Aye.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.310
You want to know why
it's so fast?

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.830
Because its captain is damned.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.270
Aye.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.540
Everyone's really confused
right now.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.720
Is this an open-source boat
that we're talking about?

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.960
Because that means lots
of people are damned.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.910
Open-source boat.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:12.790
That would be interesting.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.692
That's a new Kickstarter.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:17.460
Yarr!

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.940
And the reason this captain be
damned is because you know

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.756
what he does?

00:12:20.756 --> 00:12:22.970
He doesn't let his crew die.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.740
Nay.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.660
When he sails from port, the
first evil action he be doing

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:30.070
is he slaughters the lot of
them, slits their throats

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.240
standing on the deck and let
the blood flow across the

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.390
planks into the water, where the
sharks be feasting and the

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.640
gulls be squawking
and nesting.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.490
And you know what he does?

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:41.750
He brings a single shaman
on board with his deck.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.280
And that shaman doesn't let
these poor men die.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.130
Nay.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.360
He keeps them in some trivial
state of not dead and not

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.190
living, not dead enough
for the corpse

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.760
monster to come aboard.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.510
He manages the dead objects
on his ship, yarr.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.314
Is anyone getting that yet?

00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:01.760
OK.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.025
And what he'll do is he'll
summon a corpse as he needs

00:13:04.025 --> 00:13:06.150
it, and revive it, and then
send it back to dead by

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.530
slitting its throat again.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.140
Aye, this be an evil captain,
but what he does well is he

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.040
escapes the kraken monster
once again.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.540
It can never seem to catch this
SS Emscripten, because it

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.590
can never find it, because the
corpses never rot and ripen.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.870
You see, this evil bile-flowing
covered with

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.610
boils and rank and fester
and alimony-taking--

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.860
um, uh--

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.430
OK, so I feel I should
tell you something.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.750
It is true, the monster and
I were once in love.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.740
Arr, um, you see, I was a young
buccaneer and hadn't

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.520
seen much of the world.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.400
But you know that we grow, and
we change, and the monster and

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.810
I parted ways.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.020
But we're not here to talk
about me tonight.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.340
But he does take half of me
dubloons every month.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.190
My job tonight be keeping you
away from the path that I be

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.040
taking and teaching you how to
use the techniques of the SS

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.530
Emscripten to keep your
dinghy moving fast.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.830
So we'll start with your own
concept of a corpse pool.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.250
So when you be getting your
mates on your vessel, make

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.750
sure to slaughter them thusly.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.460
Usually across the
neck works fine.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.580
If you get any fancier than
that, it's just showing off.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.613
I mean, come on.

00:14:16.613 --> 00:14:17.320
We be pirates.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.860
We simple folk.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.640
Now, when you need a task done
or you need a crewman to

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.990
achieve a goal for you, the
best thing to be doing is

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.130
reviving him.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.460
Use your dark magic.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.730
And what you need to be doing
is you need to remember that

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.610
is corpse, it has
the memories.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.160
It remembers who
it used to be.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.580
So when you grab it off its
corpse pool, you need to get

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.310
new clothes and set it
properties so it cannot

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.420
remember who it used to
be and instead assumes

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.820
the goal you want.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.310
And when you have a
demon-summoned dead-filled

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.350
evil corpse to do your bidding,
you must usually make

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.400
sure that it follows that path
and it does the most evil,

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.950
heinous thing that you can task
it to, generally making

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.210
the world a worse place
for common folk.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.375
Take a second to let that sink
in, a zombie on [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:04.630
That would get very awkward
very fast, yarr.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.800
And when you're done with it,
much like the SS Emscripten,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.890
you slit its throat and put it
back in the pool and let it

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.650
float away.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.820
Again, this will keep the kraken
monster from actually

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.950
coming to board your deck and
taking away your speed.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.250
And this is some hieroglyphs
from an ancient time, but I'll

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.610
walk through them anyway,
because I happen to speak it.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.290
So you can see that to use such
a thing as a corpse pool,

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.590
the first thing you need to do
is actually grab a corpse and

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.420
revive it and then set its
properties accordingly, like

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.650
where it will spawn in
the universe, arr.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:37.090
Do a jig.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:37.810
Walk the plank.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.710
And then when you're done, slit
its throat, throw it back

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.670
on the pool, and then make sure
that any clothes you may

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.850
have assigned to it
you cast overboard

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.140
to Davy Jones' locker.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.280
He happens to sell things
out of the locker.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:47.940
It's why it's a locker.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.240
It's actually a secondhand
pirate store, see, yarr.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.120
That's where we get most
of our clothes, arr.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.000
What'll happen is when you use
this sort of pattern of corpse

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.100
pools or object pools, what
you'll be seeing is that your

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.270
memory will slowly
grow over time.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.790
It'll be riding a wave that will
never end, and your ship

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.570
may never come back to shore.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.830
It'll just slowly
be increasing.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.250
Now what you'll notice, though,
is that ye be spending

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.952
a lot of time in here moving
in between all these ranks.

00:16:16.952 --> 00:16:20.570
And it's worth noting that under
the hood, JavaScript may

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.340
be doing something that ye not
be planning as captain.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.520
And as captain of your vessel,
you're in charge

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.850
of its fate, Aye?

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.750
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.600
COLT MCANLIS: It's not in
charge of your fate.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.270
It's a boat.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.965
You're the captain, aye?

00:16:31.965 --> 00:16:32.450
AUDIENCE: Aye!

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.190
COLT MCANLIS: So don't let
it do what you don't

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.024
want it to do, arr.

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:37.266
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:16:37.266 --> 00:16:39.400
COLT MCANLIS: Do you know under
the hood what happens

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.040
when you have a pool of
corpses and you add

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.870
another one to it?

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.895
Well, if you've actually maxed
out the number of corpses and

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:49.120
you add a new one, you know
what your boat be

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.900
doing behind your back?

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.180
It'd be creating a new pool of
corpses double the size.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.140
That takes a lot of
extra memory.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.660
I don't know how to say
that in Pirate better.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.690
That was a little failure.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:05.740
That's OK.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.020
We're doing this on
the fly, arr.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.190
Now, let's say your container
moving forward again, and once

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.470
again, you get to the point
where instead of 200 corpses,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.110
ye added yet another, and then
you have to move again to 200.

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.450
To 400 corpses ye
be moving into.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.170
Now, what is interesting about
this is that every time ye add

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.050
a corpse to the pile, your ship
have to go back to bay

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.460
and make more room.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.060
Ye need to make changes to your
hull to accommodate all

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.680
the corpses ye be having
laying around.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.310
But once your hull has
been destroyed, ye

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.600
have to rebuild it.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.450
So you have to de-allocate the
previous array in order to

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.790
make room for the new one.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.650
This creates more waste for the
corpse monster to come and

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.050
fester and bleed and
take away from ya.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.570
It be taking your time, lads.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.900
It's not a good thing, arr?

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.050
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.300
COLT MCANLIS: Arr, you're
getting bored now.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.100
Arr!

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.920
AUDIENCE: Arr!

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.520
COLT MCANLIS: Don't worry.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.510
There be more booze soon.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.780
Really, what ye need to be
thinking ahead as the captain

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.460
of your ship, how many dead
corpses will I need to get

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.380
this job done?

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.800
Yarr, tell that to
your manager.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.600
That be CEO-level thinking
there, yarr.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.100
Yes, yarr, ye see, we can't ship
a self-driving car, but

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.340
how many corpses can
we fit in it, yarr?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.790
I guess that's a question ye
ask in Las Vegas, yarr.

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.250
Some people got that.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.420
So what ye need to be
thinking of is how

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:20.480
many corpses ye need.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.900
And instead of actually going
back to harbor many times and

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.120
rebuilding your ship and getting
more corpses, instead,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.000
ye need to think ahead and hire
the corpses and kill them

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.945
ahead of time.

00:18:29.945 --> 00:18:32.770
And the question that you have
as simple pirate folk who are

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.250
very bad at math is, how do you
determine the number of

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.750
people you'll need for this
evil task ye be setting

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.330
forward, and mostly, how many
knives will ye need, because

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.000
they kind of dull over time.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.830
Now, the proper way to be doing
this is an iterative

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.850
testing loop.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:48.640
Again, that really didn't
translate to Pirate.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.380
Just follow with me.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.760
It'll make sense in a minute.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.790
So as yer ship be going out, ye
need to be running tests.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.760
Ye need to run through what ye
think the average duration of

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.980
your journey be.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.965
And ye need to be figuring out
how many corpses ye be needing

00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:01.360
over that time.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.710
And every time, you adjust and
change and rebuild your ship.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.390
And as ye be doing all this, ye
be remembering, or logging

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.600
out, what your maximum number of
corpses be, or your average

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.260
number of corpses, or how
many of them are bald.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.790
And ye be telling me, because
then I'll be upset with ye.

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.860
We're mostly discriminated
against as bald pirates.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.450
We don't have the facial hair,
and so we can't go to all the

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.890
parties, yarr.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.760
Once ye average been done
through this process, and

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.110
remembering how many corpses
ye may need for your final

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.910
journey, only then
can ye embark.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.820
And when ye do your final
journey, you'll know ahead of

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.330
time how many objects to
reference and keep and how

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:35.680
many corpses to slay.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.250
And what we'll end up seeing
is that your memory profile

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.840
will look a little bit more
stair-like, yarr.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.710
AUDIENCE: Arr.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.540
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.690
And the number of corpses ye
need will statically decrease.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:49.340
And ye need not to go back to
the harbor so many times.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.490
That means ye stay on the water
longer, and ye stay

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.710
faster more often, yarr.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.500
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.230
COLT MCANLIS: The wind in
your sails be the best

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:57.850
wind of all, aye?

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.080
Now, sooner or later, you're
going to need to slit yet

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.310
another throat, even
though you've

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.540
pre-allocated your corpses.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.400
And when you do this, you need
to be thinking back about what

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.840
your ship be doing without
your knowledge.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.133
Will ye let it go ahead and
double the arrays every time?

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:17.095
AUDIENCE: Arr?

00:20:17.095 --> 00:20:19.020
Narr?

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.710
COLT MCANLIS: That was the most
awesome response ever.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.130
Yarr?

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.000
Narr?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.910
Nay?

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.160
The best was I saw one guy over
here look at his buddy

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.526
and go, nay?

00:20:29.526 --> 00:20:29.940
Narr?

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.560
No?

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.760
What if we just say no?

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.710
You think he'll point us out?

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.110
Quit talking.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:37.000
He's looking at us.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.310
The answer is nay, ye
not be letting the

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.220
ship do what it wants.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.080
You're the captain.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.040
You make the rules, yarr?

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.830
COLT MCANLIS: And instead of
allowing it to double in size

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.630
every time as your application
needs it and your Dom changes

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.750
and your objects move, instead,
ye be using what we

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.360
call a linear growth array,
where instead of actually

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.400
using the standard array object,
ye be using a linked

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.070
list of typed static arrays.

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.685
So as ye add a single object,
rather than doubling the size

00:21:00.685 --> 00:21:05.030
of array, ye only increase
it by certain amounts.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.830
Ye can be 100 corpses, or 1,000
corpses, or a platoon of

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.230
corpses if ye choose.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.100
Either way, they're the King's
men, and they're free.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.940
[LAUGHS]

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.990
Sorry for the British
in the audience.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.330
Yes.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.420
Now the linear growth array
actually be good, because ye

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.780
be amortizing the cost
of the corpses

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.730
over many, many corpses.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.360
So every time ye allocate a
new array, you're actually

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.300
amortizing the death of all
those because ye do it once.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:31.970
[LAUGHS]

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.490
It's tricky pirate math.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.440
[LAUGHS]

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.380
Lookup be easy to do
in this structure.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.160
Ye can simply index into it with
a little bit of magic and

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.870
fluff and dust.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.090
Ye be finding what ye need.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.190
However, deletion damn
near be impossible.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:50.250
I do not recommend that.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.860
Don't do that during
a job interview.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.730
It will reflect on you badly.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.860
I'm not saying I've done that,
but do not try that.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.410
The point here be that this is
an apt-suited container for

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.020
the growth of static corpses
on your vessel.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.070
It allows ye to grow.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.400
It allows you to preallocate.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.400
It allows ye to stay fluid
when times change, yarr.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.850
And that be the pirate way.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.810
Now, for all of ye in the
audience, ye may be saying to

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.020
yourself, I have no freaking
clue what my

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.030
memory be doing, yarr?

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:20.525
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:23.950
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr, welcome
aboard, mateys.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:25.100
That was the most hearty yarr.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.110
Yes, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.560
I am so lost right now.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.880
Thanks for playing
along, lads.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.100
For those of ye who be looking
to understand what's going on

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.520
under the hood of your deck,
you need to be looking at a

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.460
couple of tools.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.350
To start off, stick with
Chrome Developer Tools.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.460
It actually be giving ye a
pretty good understanding of

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:47.520
how many corpses and objects be
used along the duration of

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.800
your trip over time.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.280
And with new tooling on the
bottom, it'll actually tell ye

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.110
what heap these corpses be
coming from, be they the audio

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.760
heap from the southern regions
of France, or they be the

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.210
rendering heap from Jamaica.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.550
[LAUGHS]

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.890
They be a spicy lot, lads.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.060
[LAUGHS]

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.400
Anyhow, stop here.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.740
Make sure ye run your
application through the tools,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.890
figure out where your memory
is going, and adjust

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:10.560
accordingly.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.425
Ye be the captain, aye?

00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:13.790
AUDIENCE: Aye.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:15.920
COLT MCANLIS: Another great tool
that's just come out--

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.200
however, the shitty picture was
all I could find on the

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.040
internet, because for some
reason, they don't have anyone

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.940
who could put up a more
high-resolution photo of the

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.270
damn tool--

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.543
is a good tool called
Adobe GCview.

00:23:28.543 --> 00:23:30.490
And no, I couldn't get it
working, so I couldn't take

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.470
the picture myself, yarr.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.010
This is a fantastic external
tool that will allow ye to do

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.560
memory profile analysis
for multiple

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.500
different browsers, yarr.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.910
So for those of ye out here who
may be saying, oh, Captain

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.090
Main Roach, you're kind of off
the plank with Chrome only,

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.080
check these out.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.300
But seriously, put up
a better picture.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.950
That's kind of embarrassing.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.130
I'm a pirate, and I'm calling
ye out, yarr.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.185
So lads and lasses, my crew
tonight, thank ye for

00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:56.690
listening to me.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.400
Let me give you some tips
on how to avoid this

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.860
evil-building mulch monster.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.670
First off, know that this
monster be eating away at the

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.460
speed of your ship, and
that not be good.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.490
If you don't see that garbage
collection be hurting your

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.810
framerate, you're not
trying hard enough.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.790
Build a better application.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.080
Yarr, I'm calling
ye out, yarr.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.920
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.920
COLT MCANLIS: Yarr.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.676
T-shirt for that man.

00:24:18.676 --> 00:24:22.330
The rest of ye, to the planks.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.140
High corpse churn summons
the monster.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.630
If ye be moving lots of objects
around and not doing

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.680
yer duty, then the corpse
monster will find ye, it'll

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.170
slow down your vessel, and then
you'll be cursing all day

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.084
long, and I will be sitting
back laughing.

00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:35.750
[LAUGHS]

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.830
Kill your crew before
you sail.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.030
Sail them as zombies.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.585
I dare every one of you in here
to tweet that right now.

00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:48.600
Kill your crew before you sale,
hashtag #perfmatters.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.290
The bald pirate told
me to say it.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.890
I'm not crazy.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.605
Know your course count
by testing your

00:24:57.605 --> 00:24:58.670
voyage ahead of time.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.140
Be the captain of your vessel.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.350
Don't let it control you.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.323
You're in charge, yarr.

00:25:03.323 --> 00:25:04.170
AUDIENCE: Yarr.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:04.620
COLT MCANLIS: That one hurts.

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.126
Hold on.

00:25:05.126 --> 00:25:07.030
Oh.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.200
I needed to stretch my yarr.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.800
When you need more corpses, make
sure ye linearly grow.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.160
Don't allow the ship to do it.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.420
You do it yourself.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.122
In honest, I miss the
corpse monster.

00:25:20.122 --> 00:25:23.770
We did separate, and there
were little'uns involved.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.970
But we'll be back soon.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.590
With the new primitives in C++
11, there may be a chance to

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.050
get a better high-performance
application system where I may

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.570
not have to manage
my memory myself.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.720
That's a separate discussion.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.680
Anyhow, yarr thank ye all for
listening to me tonight.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.990
And I'd like to remind ye that
we won't be taking questions

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.140
now but we will be doing it at
the end of the night in a

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.970
fireside-chat manner, yarr.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.610
Thank ye be for listening
tonight.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.210
AUDIENCE: Yarr!

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.460
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
