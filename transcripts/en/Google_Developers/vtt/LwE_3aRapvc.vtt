00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:02.900
PALLAVI NARESH: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.960
My name is Pallavi Naresh.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.750
And I'm a product manager
at Google.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm joined here by my
colleagues, David Butcher and

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.580
Johnie Lee, software engineers
at Google.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.940
Now, how many of you guys were
able to attend the last

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.970
session where we introduced
the Wallet Objects API?

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.370
Great, a good number of you.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.810
Today, we're going to be talking
about redefining

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.405
loyalty for the mobile age using
the Wallet Objects API.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.960
The Wallet Objects API is an
extensible platform that lets

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.400
you take anything from your
real world wallet--

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.950
loyalty, offers, and more--

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.185
and put it in your Google
Wallet in the cloud.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.430
Now today, we're going to
be focused on loyalty.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.850
Why?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.400
Because when we talk to our
users and we talk to them

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.790
about digitizing the real world
wallet, the thing they

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.910
are most excited about are the
implications for all the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.790
loyalty cards they
carry around or

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.040
forget to carry around.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.250
We're going to start with an
overview of the problems that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.370
exist with loyalty and how
we at Google can help.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.200
Now, if you're not developing
for a loyalty program, stick

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410
around, because we're going to
give you an overview of the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.750
Wallet Objects platform and
walk you through a live

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.680
integration with our featured
partner, Marriott Rewards.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.730
This will give you a good
overview of what it takes to

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.540
use the Wallet Objects API, both
for loyalty as well as

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.790
other use cases.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.060
So what are the problems that
exist with loyalty?

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.860
Well, first, we have
too many cards.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.160
We can't carry them all
around with us.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.165
And often, we forget them when
we need them the most.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.680
On the flip side, when we want
to sign up for a new

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.060
program, it's hard.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.210
There are long forms to fill
out by hand at the worst

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.440
possible time.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.630
Picture this.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.090
You've just taken
a long flight.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.480
You show up at your hotel.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.210
You're not a member of the
loyalty program, but you want

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.000
to get points for your stay.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.750
You also want to get to bed.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.825
This is the worst time to
fill out more paperwork.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.650
And finally, it's hard to keep
track of all the benefits

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.760
we're accruing across all the
programs we're members of.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.530
Over 16 billion points go unused
in the US every year.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.780
That's a lot of money.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.260
So how can we at Google help?

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.140
And how can you help if
you're developing

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.390
for a loyalty program?

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.070
Your program in Google Wallet,
a single place for consumers

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.310
to track all of their loyalty
cards, geo-triggered around

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.430
your business so that your
customers never have to forget

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.430
their card at home again.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.620
Instant enrollment--

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.140
acquire new customers instantly
from the phone, also

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.410
geo-triggered so the sign up
screen is waiting for them as

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.660
they walk through your doors.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.190
And deeper engagement with your
existing customers and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.990
your new customers.

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.740
Point updates, account
updates in real time.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.260
Details on when your loyalty
rewards are going to expire.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.680
So your customers never have to
worry about letting those

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.080
points go unused.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.450
And personalized messages
delivered right on the phone.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.380
The best part about all this
is that it's an easy

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.390
integration into your existing
loyalty systems.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.870
I hope you're as excited about
the platform as we are.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.640
I'm going to give it over to
David to walk you through a

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.680
technical overview.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.930
DAVID BUTCHER: Thanks,
Pallavi.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.400
So this platform API is in the
form of a REST service.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.700
So it's resource oriented.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.910
So I'm going to spend a little
time on the two main

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.630
resources, the first of which
is the Wallet Object class.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.770
The second is the instance or
the object, and we'll get that

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.920
in the subsequent slide.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.410
The idea here is that it's
REST via JSON over HTTP.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.150
We see in front of us some JSON
for a particular class.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.170
The Wallet Object class is
defining the shared data for a

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.720
single program which is going
to have many cards in it.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.620
The Wallet Object class is
defining some of the shared

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.770
data like, for example, here
we see the issuer name, the

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.850
program name, Marriott Rewards,
the rewards tier.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.016
There presumably would be a
class per rewards tier so that

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:08.970
there could be a little bit
different look and feel for

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.100
the different tiers.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.510
And it also maps to the specific
look and feel that's

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.760
going to show up
on the device.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.310
It's important to note that this
is a polymorphic object.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.290
The class of the proper is in
the type, Wallet Object class,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.000
loyalty class.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.200
This is a loyalty class.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.760
That specifies that there's a
particular schema behind this,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.550
and there would be fields that
are specific to that schema.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.970
Other schemas exist.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.450
They're schemas for loyalty
here, for offers, mentioned in

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.260
the previous session.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.290
We're going to be doing things
like boarding passes and some

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.260
other stuff.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.230
And there will also be a generic
class that has no

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.460
pre-defined schema that allows
you to define your own.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.070
The Wallet Object is an instance
of this class.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.080
So for each program, there will
be actual cards showing

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.310
up on devices or
within Wallets.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.600
And that corresponds to
the Wallet Object.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.840
This is also polymorphic.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.270
You'll see here that
it's using the

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.260
same type as the class.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.110
It also has specific information
for this end user,

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.265
for example, the number of
loyalty points that have been

00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:21.515
awarded to this user.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.250
OK, the relationship--

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.500
if this wasn't completely
clear-- between the object and

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.570
the class is that for each
class there's a bunch of

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.115
objects and for each object
there's a single class.

00:06:35.115 --> 00:06:37.740
This will become important later
when we think about how

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.850
we do updates.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.860
This is your data.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.110
You can update this data
anytime you like.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.860
If you do an update to the class
information, it gets

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.350
broadcast to all of the devices
that are holding an

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.610
instance in that class.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.590
You could also, as
we'll see later,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.840
directly update the object.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.330
So you as the issuer
own this data.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.780
You can create it and update
it as you please.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.200
There are very few rules
on when you do this.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.030
You can push these updates
as you like.

00:07:11.606 --> 00:07:13.600
Did I screw up?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.630
Right.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.880
Where am I?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.300
OK.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.640
There are a few different
ways of getting

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.760
instances into the Wallet.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.450
The Save to Wallet from the
browser allows any website to

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.370
include some JavaScript to
enable Save to Wallet.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.800
What happens here is the end
user visits the site and

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.890
clicks on the Save to Wallet
button, and we arrange for

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.490
that to be put onto the
device or devices.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.760
This is a pretty important point
is that things get into

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.710
the user's Wallet, the
customer's wallet, because

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.770
they put them there.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.530
This is a very strong signal
of interest here.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.920
In addition-- and this is a
loyalty specific thing.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.730
Most of the things that I'm
talking about are pretty much

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.790
general to Wallet Objects
across the board.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.450
But there are some specific ways
to get new instances of

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.770
loyalty into the Wallet--

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.340
specifically, sign
up and link.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.090
Sign up is for people who are
new to your program, and they

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.590
want to participate.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.430
And link is when they have an
existing physical artifact and

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.550
they want to get it into
their virtual Wallet.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.200
And we'll see these in detail
in the demo when

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.450
Johnie covers that.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.020
So of course, this is Google.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.760
When you push an update, either
to an instance or a

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.100
class, we will reliably deliver
that update at scale,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.530
even if that class may have
thousands of instances

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.790
associated with it distributed
geographically.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.040
We'll make sure that
gets delivered.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.580
This is an important point to
note, is that when we get

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.420
stuff onto the phone, it's
cached there, and it can be

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.060
used online and offline.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:06.590
In addition, we can leverage
Google's geo-indexing to get

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.830
really intelligent, here
and now surfacing.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.860
So the idea here is that you
walk into, let's say, a

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.420
Marriott, and we can determine
that you have, in fact, a

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.980
loyalty card relevant here.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.060
We can bring it up and show you
that there is and go ahead

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.650
and use it.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:25.180
Or we could surface that you
can sign up for such a card

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.450
right here and now.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.700
Hence the name.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.250
And now that I've given that
over to you, I'd like to turn

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.090
it over to Jonie to demonstrate

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.930
some of that stuff.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.430
JOHNIE LEE: Thank you.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.700
Thanks, David.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.050
Hi, I'm Johnie Lee, and I'm
here to talk to you today

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.210
about merchant integration with
the Wallet Objects API.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.430
If you were at the earlier
session, you would have gotten

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.000
a quick peek of the sign up
functionality for a Marriott

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.150
Rewards program within
a Google Wallet.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.910
Marriott Rewards is one of our
featured partners with over 42

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.640
million loyalty members.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.130
We have been working with
Marriott Rewards in building a

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.860
solution that complements their

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.920
existing mobile strategy.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.210
During this part of the session,
I will decompose the

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.640
sign up and linking
functionality of the earlier

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.140
demo, and just to give you an
idea of what it takes to

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.470
integrate with our Wallet
Objects API.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.190
Keep in mind, though, that this
is a demo, and that when

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.370
we launch the consumer
experience, the Marriott

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:30.620
screens may differ.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.030
The three parts of integration
that I will focus on today is

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.550
the creating of a loyalty
Wallet Object.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.980
This is, as David mentioned
earlier, the base object that

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.210
represents a loyalty program.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.430
The second step is the setting
up of the signed up and

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.580
linking call back service.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.130
This allows the instant sign up
and linking directly from

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.770
the mobile phone.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.050
And the third and final step is
the updating of the user's

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.910
loyalty information
from the cloud.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.340
As David mentioned earlier, the
Wallet Object class is the

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.180
base representation for a
loyalty card, or a number of

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.000
loyalty cards.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.320
What we have here is the Wallet
Object class that was

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.320
used for the Marriott demo.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.260
In this we indicate the issuer
name and program name as

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.190
Marriott and Marriott Rewards.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.110
And we specified the labels
that are used

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.790
for each of the fields.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.410
In this case, the rewards tiers
are levels, and the

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.280
account IDs are member IDs.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.050
So let's go ahead and try
inserting a loyalty Wallet

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.300
Object class.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.190
So what we have here is the same
exact Wallet Object class

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.560
that I showed earlier.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.810
This is the JSON representation
of the Marriott

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.460
Rewards loyalty card.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.310
And in here, as I pointed out
earlier, we have the issuer

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.300
name, the program name, as well
as additional information

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.420
such as the logo that will be
used to render the loyalty

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.480
card and also the template
that will be

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.730
used for the rendering.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.630
So as David mentioned earlier,
this is a REST based service.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:30.020
And to insert a class, it's as
easy as calling the Wallet

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.730
Object class endpoint with
this as the payload.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.430
Sorry.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:37.460
Right there.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.120
And let's give that a try.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.250
So voila.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:47.090
We've inserted a brand new
Wallet Object class in the

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:48.670
Google Wallet cloud.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.610
At this point, you should be
able to use this Wallet Object

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.050
class for save to Wallet as well
as sign up and linking.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.910
Instant sign up and linking
allows your users to sign up

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.300
for a brand new loyalty card for
your program directly from

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.430
the mobile phone or link their
existing loyalty card with

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.180
your loyalty program
to Google Wallet.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.860
This is all done through the
phone using Google Wallet.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.690
How this works is that a request
is sent from the

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.250
client phone to the Google
Wallet cloud to the merchant

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.370
callback service.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.710
And the merchant callback
service responds with an

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.930
approved or rejected state.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.460
So what we're looking at
here is an example

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.140
of a sign up request.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.580
The primary thing to focus on
in here is the Wallet user

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.340
profile in the middle of
the sign up request.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.850
One of the benefits of instant
sign up is that we use the

00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:00.770
information that is in the
user's Wallet profile to

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:05.690
pre-populate the forms that are
used to sign up for your

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.000
loyalty program.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.370
The merchant will need to
pre-select a number of fields

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.950
that they would like, which
includes first name, last

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.680
name, email, phone
number, maybe zip

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.365
code, a number of options.

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.430
The information is sent to the
merchant with the user's

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.730
explicit permission.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.560
So once the merchant has
received their request and

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.240
processed the request, the
merchant is expected to send

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.010
back an either improved
response

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.850
or a failure response.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.510
This is an example of a
successful response.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.100
In this, the three main fields
to focus on are the sign up

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.900
result-- in this case,
it's approved--

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.410
the welcome message, and
the Wallet Object.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.440
The welcome message is what is
shown to the user when they've

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.270
successfully signed up for the
program welcoming them to be

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.050
your loyalty program.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.830
The Wallet Object is the
representation of the loyalty

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.860
account within Google Wallet.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.040
In the Wallet Object, it
contains information such as

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.200
the number of loyalty points,
the status, and account name.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.455
For a failure response, this is
a typical failure response.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.840
We have a sign up result, which
is in this case was

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.480
rejected, and the message

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.825
indicating why it was rejected.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.330
So let's go through and
take a look at an

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.395
example callback service.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.450
So what we have here is a
Python based App Engine

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.840
service that was used to run the
Marriott Rewards demo from

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.580
earlier today.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:01.230
Since we cannot actually hook
up to the Marriott loyalty

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.970
back end, I've subbed out the
system by creating this data

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.230
access layer which supported
creating a new loyalty account

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.590
from the user profile and
looking up an existing loyalty

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.540
account using the account ID.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:23.360
And I pre-populate the values
for the account with a random

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.020
number of points.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.410
The request handler
here handles two

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.370
types of post requests--

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.120
sign up and linking.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.750
For sign up, the three steps
that I go through is first, I

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.980
create a new loyalty account
in my back end.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.280
Then I take that loyalty account
and convert it from my

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.150
domain specific loyalty account
to a Wallet Object.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:51.200
As you can see in here, I do
a direct mapping from the

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.640
account name to the account
name field in the Wallet

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.650
Object, account ID
respectively.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.320
In addition to that, I do
additional customization to

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.730
further brand this loyalty
card for the

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:04.980
Marriott Rewards program.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:12.680
Once I've done that, I add the
additional welcome message and

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.270
the sign up result, as you can
see here, and wrap that in the

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.890
JSON RPC 2.0 envelope.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.390
So we can actually go ahead
and give this a try.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.849
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to send this fake

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:29.700
request here with the Wallet
user, John Smith and the phone

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.420
number there, to an App Engine
server that is run locally.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:43.050
So here's the request that we're
sending, and the App

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:47.010
Engine server responded
correctly with the Wallet

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.220
Object instance and response.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.180
So this is fine and all.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.670
But why don't we look at the
in the real production

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:54.920
environment on the phone?

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.060
So here--

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.560
focus.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.810
Good.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.910
So here, I have the Google
Wallet application that we are

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.040
using for testing.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.350
And again, this is for demo
purposes, and the actual

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.640
consumer experience
may differ.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.030
And what we do is we go in
here, find the Marriott

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:30.100
Rewards program, and it should
load up the additional

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.950
information about the
Marriott Rewards.

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.260
This was similar to the demo
that you saw earlier.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.910
Then we click on Join Now.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.730
And as you can see, it
pre-populates the form with

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.780
the name of the user on this
phone, on this account.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.160
I agree to the terms,
and I would like to

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.050
get additional emails.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.300
And then I create an account.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.280
And there you go.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.490
We have a brand new loyalty card
instantly inserted into

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.740
our Google Wallet application.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.350
So let's take a look at
the back end server

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.760
that ran this instance.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.015
Right here, we have the logs
for the App Engine server.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.660
And as you can see
here, this is the

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.980
request that was received.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.770
And this was the response
that was returned back.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.250
And really, that's
all there is to

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.730
creating a callback service.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.860
Obviously, when you integrate
this with your loyalty back

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.560
end, there's additional business
logics that you may

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.250
use to create provision
a new account or

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.070
link an existing account.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:01.380
So your once your consumers
have linked their loyalty

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.010
account with your loyalty
program to Google Wallet, this

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.060
is where the fun part
really comes in.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.830
This is the part that you can
really engage your consumers

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.400
by updating their information
regularly or sending them

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.040
messages directly to
their mobile phone.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.380
To updatable a loyalty account,
as David mentioned

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.530
earlier, we send this
REST resource to

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.910
the resource endpoint.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.400
This is a Wallet
Object payload.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.560
And in here, we update
the number of

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.230
points to 2000 points.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:46.050
And you can also update any of
the other fields as necessary.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.508
We then send this as
a part request to

00:20:50.508 --> 00:20:51.758
the resource endpoint.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.450
Likewise, for messages, we
send the message payload

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:01.390
either to a Wallet Object
endpoint or to a Wallet Object

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.700
class endpoint.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.120
The difference being that a
message sent to Wallet Object

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.560
goes to one specific user, and
a message sent to a Wallet

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.670
Object class goes to
a group of users.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.230
So why don't we give
this a try here?

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.880
All right.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.560
So last night, I stayed at the
Marriott Marquis, like many

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.130
people here.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.860
And I've earned an additional
2,500 points for staying at

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.290
the Marriott Marquis.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.590
So what I would like to do is
then update the number of

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:46.120
points for this loyalty account
to reflect my new

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.980
points status.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.360
What I've done is I've taken
the Wallet Object

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.510
that we just created.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.230
We update the version
number to indicate

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.860
that it's an update.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:03.880
And then we update the number
of points to 2,500.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:12.110
At this point, we find the ID
that was created, that we

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:19.820
created and send that payload
to that resources endpoint.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.970
And then there you go.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.090
The number of points
has updated.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:34.480
And then if we go back to the
phone itself and hit refresh,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.762
we can see that the number
of points is now 2,500.

00:22:38.762 --> 00:22:42.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.260
JOHNIE LEE: There you go--

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.370
2,500.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.370
So what I've shown you here
is the ability to easily

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.170
integrate with the Wallet
Object back end.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.160
And to go back to a story that
Pallavi told earlier.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.400
Imagine now you walk into
the lobby of a hotel.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.020
You have your Google
Wallet on you.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.890
You realize that you
don't have a

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.650
membership with that hotel.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:11.770
You find that program in your
Google Wallet, sign up

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.400
instantly, and by the time you
check in, your loyalty account

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.120
is updated to the most recent
point transaction.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.470
Now, that is a great
user experience.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.200
I will turn it back to
Pallavi for wrap up.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:24.870
PALLAVI NARESH: Great.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.626
Thanks, Johnie.

00:23:27.626 --> 00:23:28.590
Let's see.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.840
How do I switch this back?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.300
We hope that you'll walk away
from this session with a good

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.280
understanding on how to use
the Wallet Objects API to

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.340
acquire new customers
and engage

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.490
your existing customers.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:49.260
The best part about this is that
it's a single simple API

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.340
for loyalty offers and more.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.350
We're already working with some
great partners, including

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.000
several folks who are powering
some of the world's largest

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.420
loyalty programs.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.550
If you're interested in signing
up, visit the website

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.730
listed here on this slide.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.730
And we're providing access
in the coming days.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:14.870
We're also available
outside for office

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.110
hours in our sandbox.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.960
You can also check out some live
integrations there to see

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.160
this all in action.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.430
With that, I want to open the
floor up for questions.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.330
Any questions?

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.110
Feel free to come up to
the mic in the middle.

00:24:31.062 --> 00:24:32.540
DAVID BUTCHER: Shy crowd.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.100
Here's one.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.300
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.830
Are there any plans to make
the developer version of

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.120
Google Wallet that you guys
are using available to

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.540
developers along
with the APIs?

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:50.690
PALLAVI NARESH: For now, we are
working with partners to

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.010
provide tools that allow you to

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.110
preview your Wallet Objects.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.390
And then we are working to
quickly launch the consumer

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.910
experience so that you
can use that in

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.245
your development process.

00:25:02.245 --> 00:25:03.495
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:15.530
AUDIENCE: In the app, how much
room do you have to customize

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.670
how your Wallet Object looks?

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.938
And are there plans to
change things if

00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:25.080
they're not that flexible?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.610
PALLAVI NARESH: So we actually
allow several degrees of

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:32.070
freedom in customization so that
you can really showcase

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.320
your brand.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.620
For specific details, you
can check out the

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.660
documentation on the API.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.220
But in general, it's quite
flexible in terms of the

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.390
layout you can choose, the
colors, the logos, as well as

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.360
the information that you
show in your card.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:51.840
Great.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.410
AUDIENCE: So the consumer of
your services really seems to

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.240
be aimed at businesses--

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.960
creating loyalty cards that
reflect what they offer in the

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.770
physical world.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.830
But like we saw with Apple's
Passbook, there was an

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.780
opportunity for companies that
wanted to support small

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.760
businesses that don't have
formal loyalty programs to

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.340
sort of consolidate and
act as a broker.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.640
Is there a similar
opportunity here?

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.700
Or do you think that the main
consumer is going to be

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.920
partners who create
loyalty programs

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.800
for their own business?

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.360
PALLAVI NARESH: We're actually
already partnering with

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.660
BellyCard that is doing exactly
what you describe.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.100
So you can also use the Wallet
Objects API to--

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.170
AUDIENCE: Represent other--

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.140
PALLAVI NARESH: To
represent others.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.800
That's right.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.420
That was the question.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.670
Thanks.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.810
PALLAVI NARESH: More
questions?

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.200
Great.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.820
Well then, with that, we'll wrap
up and hope to see you

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.040
guys all in our sandbox
outside.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.650
DAVID BUTCHER: Thank you.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.900
JOHNIE LEE: Thank you.
