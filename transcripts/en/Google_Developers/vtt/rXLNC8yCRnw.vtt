[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.340
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, everyone.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.800
Welcome to our very first "Stack
Overflow" and Chrome

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.870
for Android Hangout.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.590
This is the very first time
that we've done this.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.240
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.680
I'd like to introduce
Matt Gaunt.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.507
Matt, do you want to say
hello to everyone?

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:17.892
MATT GAUNT: Hi, everyone.

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:19.620
PAUL KINLAN: Well done.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.010
Cool.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.050
So yeah, this is the first
of us at the moment.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.690
So what we're trying to do with
this show is kind of show

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.000
you our workflow for how we
actually do with "Stack

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.450
Overflow" questions and how we
support the community inside

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.530
"Stack Overflow" for Chrome on
Android and Chrome in general.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.730
So we're going to do
a couple of things.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.805
We're also definitely going
to answer questions live.

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.930
I say "live." we did go through
and prepare the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.720
answers for quite a lot of these
earlier today because we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.390
didn't want this show just to be
full of "uh" and "um" and,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.410
"Yeah, that's a bug." You will
see a lot of, "Yeah, that's a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.110
bug." But yeah, I think we're
going to be quite cool.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.235
If you hear in the background
today I've got some kids with

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:01.980
me just crying.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.810
Don't worry about it.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.740
They're just-- it's bed time,
and they don't like it.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.320
It's fine.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.350
But yeah, so we're going to
show you our workflow.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.510
We're going to show you how
we think you should--

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.500
well, not how you should file
issues on "Stack Overflow,"

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.510
but what we think is a good
process for helping us help

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.930
you, if that makes sense.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.790
Because sometimes, it's a little
bit hard to work out

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.350
what you mean.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.610
And we'll just kind of
walk through that

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.900
flow of what we do.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.120
So Matt, shall we jump straight
on to the "Stack

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.790
Overflow" questions?

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.400
MATT GAUNT: Let's just do it.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.190
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
let's do it.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.180
So you're going to see not
my face anymore, which is

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.840
normally a good thing.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.300
So "Stack Overflow,"
here we go.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.540
This is our special tag
that we've got.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.850
Well, it's not a special tag.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.430
It's google-chrome
and android.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.010
They're two separate tags that
we've got inside "Stack

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.800
Overflow."

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.390
And this is actually
how we monitor.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.830
And my day just normally
consists of me just pressing

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.840
screens like this and then
seeing what happens.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.390
So we'll start off.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.090
Shall we start off with
the first one, Matt?

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.230
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, let's just
do it, right from the top.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.620
PAUL KINLAN: Right
from the top.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.315
So this one has actually
been closed, I think.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:13.960
But basically, the question is,
Chrome browser in Android

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.190
always renames the downloaded
file to download.bin.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.310
And basically, what it's saying
is if the file is over

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.110
28 megabytes in size, then it
won't respect the name.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.200
Now there are a couple of things
that we need to get

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.140
sorted with this is that
I actually think

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.410
there's a bug in this.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.890
The question's been, I think,
closed originally, and so we

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.010
can't do too much with it.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.350
But anyway, the general idea is
that there's a thing called

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.070
a download attribute on
[INAUDIBLE], which, if I load

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.240
up JS Bin now, we should
see one of the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.860
examples that I've done.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.230
Sorry, just--

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.600
I can't see the screen
properly.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.050
File system demo,
there we are.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.930
Now if I zoom back in, what
you'll see actually isn't the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.560
answer to the question, but
there's this attribute here

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.790
called download equals log.txt,
and that actually

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.490
saves the name.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.120
Now the interesting thing that
we've got about this is if you

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.370
go back to this question, I
can't really answer this

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.520
question because there's
not enough

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.770
information in this page.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:16.990
There isn't any code.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.300
There's just reference to the
fact that he uses IIS 7.5,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.930
which is fine.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.640
But we don't actually
understand how

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.980
the download is initiated.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.660
And there's a couple of things
that you can do.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.300
You can set the content--

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.120
the disposition, basically, on
the type if it's coming in

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.970
from the server.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.400
But if it's generated from the
client, for instance, you can

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.920
do things like that anchor
attribute that we saw before

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.170
with download, you can set
the name from that.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.490
And the thing I wanted to talk
about inside this bug in

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.390
particular is that there has
been a bug inside Chrome,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.300
which is in stable right now,
so it's broken in the stable

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.830
version of Chrome, where if you
give a name [? in the ?]

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.850
download attribute, it doesn't
actually let you

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.360
download the file.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.890
It starts up the Android
download manager but then just

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.570
kind of flakes out.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.860
Now the really cool thing is if
you get the beta, which you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.760
can find from Google Search, if
you get that beta, you'll

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.690
see it's actually fixed.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.070
So if you actually specify a
download attribute on your

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.740
anchor, you'll see the file
is actually named.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.600
And it won't be called
download.bin, which is what

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.140
you get it you don't name
the file at the moment.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.270
So this one, it might
be fixed.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.920
I think my kid's getting
told off at the moment.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.330
So it might be fixed
in the latest beta.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.670
But we're going to have
to check it later on.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.370
And unfortunately, we can't
really answer this question.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.220
So this isn't a bad question.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.890
I know the guy's
got a problem.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.400
We want to try and help
as much as possible.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.430
But we can't really do too much
with this other than say,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.453
you know, it might actually
be fixed.

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:47.060
Matt, do you have any other
thoughts about that one?

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.980
MATT GAUNT: No.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.920
I must admit, I did actually
find it, I think it was a

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.060
couple of days ago I actually
experienced exactly the same

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.600
thing, so I have the feeling
it could be a bug.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.620
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it
could be a bug.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.690
And so what we'll do in a minute
is we'll try and show a

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.730
little bit of the process
that we go through.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.840
Once we know a little bit
more, we can actually

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.480
reproduce the problem.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.300
Actually, tell you what.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.240
We'll go into this overlap
in slide transition.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.720
Now this is on the other end
of a lot of information has

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.243
been provided to us.

00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:20.450
You can probably see here,
there's a lot of list elements

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.790
and everything.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.830
And then the guy says, if
you look at Firebug, the

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.370
attribute's applied.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.240
I'm not too sure why he's using
Firebug with Chrome.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.590
You can get a lot better
integration with Chrome using

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.635
the DevTools.

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:33.650
If you're in the Chrome
Canary, you can go to

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.676
chrome://inspect, and if you've
got ADB running, you

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:39.040
can actually see your
devices, and you can

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.610
actually debug the devices.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.366
And I think Matt might be able
to show you a little bit of

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:43.940
that later on.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.800
So this question here is, we
can't actually answer this

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.370
question either, unfortunately,
because when

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.840
you actually go and press the
site, I can't actually work

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.840
out what the problem is.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.670
He says basically, it doesn't
transition exactly correctly.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.770
So I think that this type of
question, some screenshots

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.610
would be really cool.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.890
I know it's a little bit awkward
sometimes to get a

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.484
screenshot off the phone
and on, and it takes a

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:06.200
little bit of time.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.240
But in this case, I couldn't
actually find out what the

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.740
problem was, so I couldn't
actually offer any help.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.440
Which is a little bit
frustrating, because we want

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.190
to really help these guys
solve their problems.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.470
But the next one actually is
a kind of interesting one

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.400
because we can actually
help out on this one.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.880
And the question is, I can't
open local files from the

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.980
FileSystem API on my
Android phone.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.110
So this one is kind of cool
because, Matt, I think this is

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.460
the one that we got the
demo for as well,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.500
so we can kind of--

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.270
oh no, it's not, actually.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:40.840
It's later on.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.870
The two questions are
really similar.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.640
And essentially, the person
wants to be able to take their

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.620
file from the file system.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.500
In this case, it's an
XML HTTP request,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.440
which is kind of cool.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.425
So they're going to download
something from the internet

00:08:56.425 --> 00:08:59.370
and cache it locally inside
not the database but the

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.880
FileSystem API.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.190
And the FileSystem API is like
a normal Unix-based file

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.050
system so you can write data
to it and read data from it

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.580
and iterate through the
directories and all the type

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.860
of file structure that
we'd normally expect.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.660
The interesting thing about this
is I actually think this

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.550
part of the question is a little
bit of a red herring

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.145
because it's basically anything,
I need to get the

00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:20.890
array buffer and save it.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:21.950
And the guy can--

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:22.470
I say the guy.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.670
The person who did this bug
can actually save it.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.050
And we know they can save it
because what they're saying is

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.300
that the file is visible
from the actual file

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.820
system inside Chrome.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.650
So if you go to filesystem
Chrome, the URL forward slash

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.800
persistent, you'll actually
see the list of files that

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.810
have been offline cached.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.250
Now the interesting thing here
is this is where it gets a

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.890
little bit more interesting.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.200
Again, because you can see the
person is basically saying, I

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.490
want to save to a PDF, and then
I want to write to it.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.780
And then when it's written,
we'll save out.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.030
Now the interesting thing
is that this here

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.060
is the actual problem.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.440
So the exact error message in
English is "Untitled, download

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.566
unsuccessful." Now this,
unfortunately, is the bit that

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.535
we really, really need
to know and we really

00:10:10.535 --> 00:10:11.810
need to try and debug.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.560
And everything above it doesn't
particularly help us

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.370
that much when we're looking at
this, other than the fact

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.435
that we know that the
"download started"

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:20.680
notification happens.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.800
So there's a couple of things
that happened here.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.810
And if we go down to my answer,
basically, so I

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:31.440
answered this about four hours
ago, is that on stable, it

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.420
kind of works.

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.490
In beta, it does work, in the
sense that the stable version

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.030
of the program has this
attribute problem.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.950
So the demo that we saw before,
this file system demo,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.380
this is the code I recreate--

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.871
[HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]

00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:46.650
PAUL KINLAN: That's my son
not liking going to

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.430
sleep at the moment.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.990
So in this demo, basically, in
this actual question, we've

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.230
written this demo to try
and log the file.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.690
And now if I press save
on the desktop, it's

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:57.670
a little bit awkward.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:03.520
You might have seen at the
bottom of the screen, there is

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.590
the log.txt file, which if I
open, you're not going to be

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.640
able to see because
I'm sharing the

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.030
window and not the screen.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.860
But it basically says,
hello world.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.190
Now this works on a desktop,
but it doesn't work on the

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.100
phone in stable.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.640
But if you go to the latest beta
version of Chrome, you'll

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.550
find that basically,
it works now.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.820
Now the way that we answer this
question is basically

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.180
saying, it's not the
greatest solution.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.820
In stable right now for the
majority of your users,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.990
there's really nothing that you
can do about this problem,

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.690
unfortunately.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.670
But in the beta, it's going
to work as expected.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.910
And we've given the
demo beneath which

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.280
shows how it works.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.230
Now the interesting thing about
this is I would normally

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.940
raise a bug.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.540
But because I know I've raised
the bug in the past, and it's

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:48.770
been fixed--

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.410
MATT GAUNT: Paul, Paul, it's
getting a bit creepy without

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.510
having a face on screen,
I've got to admit.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.631
We need to bring you
back on, man.

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.228
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, do you want
to bring me back in?

00:11:56.228 --> 00:11:57.722
Let me just jump out.

00:11:57.722 --> 00:11:58.720
[CHILD CRYING]

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.940
MATT GAUNT: There we go.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.850
PAUL KINLAN: The sounds of
the crying [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:03.610
So anyway, yeah.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.710
So we basically find this
bug normally, and

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.580
we raise the bug.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.690
And I'll show you how
we do that in a bit.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.890
Actually, it's not that
interesting, really.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.960
But then we go and find it, and
then we'll go and fix it

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.880
or get it fixed or prioritize
and escalate it.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:24.366
Now the interesting thing about
this is we know it's

00:12:24.366 --> 00:12:25.310
going to get fixed.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.055
And that's all we have to really
do is say, it's going

00:12:27.055 --> 00:12:28.840
to get fixed, and this answers
your question.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.780
And if we give a demo to how
it's actually going to work,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.570
that's going to be great.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.370
Because the hardest thing
actually is parsing out what

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.650
normally happens inside the
JavaScript and HTML from a

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.450
question and trying to re-create
that in your

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:41.080
application.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.180
So that's why we've given the
link into the JS Bin, to

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.510
answer your question.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.650
MATT GAUNT: It's also a lot of
the times that it simplifies

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.360
things for us is if we already
a JS vid or a JS Bin link,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.100
where someone's gone, here's
an example of the problem.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.900
So I've taken the source code
that I would have put in Stack

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.500
Overflow anyway but just made
sure it's in a small sample.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.610
The nice thing with that is
often, if you're working on a

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.880
production product, you can't
really put the code in.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.170
Whereas JS Bin and JS
[INAUDIBLE], it means you can

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.800
condense everything
down to really the

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.160
core of your problem.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.340
And that means we can take that,
fork it, play around

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.210
with it, adjust it, try and
diagnose the problems

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.770
ourselves and then either come
back with a fix or, like you

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.370
say, we get the opportunity
to go and raise a bug.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.990
And then we can also point our
engineers to that as well.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:30.830
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I think
that's the most important bit

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:34.350
is that whenever we
ask the engineers,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.220
they cry like crazy.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.100
But then at the same time
is they ask for a

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.510
reproducible case.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.250
And if we give them an entire
web page, like an entire

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.390
application, they can't
break down exactly

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.415
what the problem is.

00:13:44.415 --> 00:13:46.810
And if you can get a
reproducible case, that really

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.230
helps engineers actually try
and solve the problem.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.820
And if you can't get a
reproducible case, sometimes

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.150
it means that the actual issue
or the logic might be on your

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.940
side of things.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.020
So let me just jump out to
the previous question.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.650
That was the one thing I really,
really wanted to

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.140
mention was, if you actually
notice, there's an issue on

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.280
the desktop but not inside
mobile Chrome, or the other

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:07.790
way around.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.830
There was an issue on
the mobile Chrome,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.200
but not on the desktop.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.670
It's normally a bug.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.900
It's not normally kind of
something different in the

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.460
stack or kind of
anywhere else.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.040
It normally is the fact that
something is not working as

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.190
it's expected to work.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.380
And a great case is this
download thing that we've just

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.035
seen before where, you want to
try and download some data and

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.830
give it a name, and it just
doesn't work on the desk-- it

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.690
works on the desktop, doesn't
work on mobile.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.180
That's a really strong
indication that you should

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.060
raise a bug.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.450
Now the interesting thing, so
normally what happens from

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.410
this, and I'm just going to
jump back to my screen, is

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:47.360
that what will happen is we'll
find a bug, but then we'll go

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.906
to [INAUDIBLE], I think.

00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:56.430
The other way around.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.200
No, that's not the one.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.010
That could have been a really
dodgy site, [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:06.870
New, new dot, there we are.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.620
Basically what happens is that
URL, that really short URL,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.420
will take you to the place
where you can submit an

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.470
Android issue.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.540
And the template you want
to use is Android.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.610
And then you just basically give
us as much information as

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.480
possible, the steps
to reproduce.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.500
If you're going to download a
file, for instance, you'd say,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.220
click on this link.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:24.490
I have this attribute set.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.910
It doesn't download the file,
and those type of things.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.020
And then the expected
and actual result.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.903
The expected result isn't, it
should work, which is normally

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:32.630
what we get.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.570
But like, if you expect to have
a log.txt produced, say

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.630
that you should expect to see
a log.txt file on your local

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.190
file system.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.910
So that's one of the things we
use when we're doing the bug

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.250
tracking is new.mcrbug.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.840
And that's the site which
I have no idea

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:50.465
what that one was.

00:15:50.465 --> 00:15:52.310
That was just my typo.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.390
So I'm going to jump back to the
previous question, or the

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.540
next question.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.120
So this one's actually been
closed, but i did actually

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.610
want to answer this one.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.115
Will Chrome on Android
eventually support Pepper, and

00:16:04.115 --> 00:16:06.280
thus, the Flash player?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.200
The basic answer, it's
not going to happen.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.970
Unless some things change
internally, it's

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.070
not going to happen.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.550
We want to make sure that
all the web pages

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.800
are completely sandboxed.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.450
MATT GAUNT: And I think given
the way Flash has been going

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.980
on mobile, it doesn't seem like
many of the browsers are

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.940
really supporting it.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.790
So it kind of feels like we
should be pushing the web

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.015
forward for more responsive
sites.

00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:30.785
And it doesn't seem like Flash
really has much of a place in

00:16:30.785 --> 00:16:32.340
there at the moment.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.400
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it doesn't.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.910
That's he easiest way
of saying it.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.820
But it's not just Flash.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.730
It's all the plug-ins as well.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.790
We can't get the plug-ins
working across all these

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.955
devices properly.

00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:47.150
He doesn't like going to
bed at the moment.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.650
And so we can't get all these
plug-ins working across all

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.550
the devices.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.180
And we want it to be a pure,
open web, and that's the way

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.940
that we're going at the moment,
and that's what were

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.600
trying to support.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.000
So let me just jump back to the
screen, because I want to

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.880
also go to the next question,
which I think that we've got a

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.210
demo for at the moment
as well.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.140
So there we are.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:10.030
Next question, fetching a blog
in Chrome from Android.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.729
So Matt, this is the one that
we've got a demo for, right?

00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:13.750
MATT GAUNT: I believe so.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.180
This is the--

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:14.859
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.410
PAUL KINLAN: So I'm going to
hand across to you in a second

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.670
on this one.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.359
But this is a really good
report, actually, because

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:27.160
basically, it says it works in
Chrome for Firefox on desktop

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.570
and Android, but not on
Chrome for Android.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.600
And then we get a good

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.030
description of what's happening.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.260
So basically, requesting the
video from somewhere on the

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.925
web of response type blob, and
then we're going to cache it

00:17:36.925 --> 00:17:38.320
in the local file system.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.780
So it's nearly exactly the same
as the question that we

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.632
saw earlier on in the show.

00:17:42.632 --> 00:17:45.470
But it's a little bit different
because the actual

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.860
issue here is that once the
blob's been taken and made a

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:54.780
[? URL ?] of, we can't
attach it to the

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.770
source, the video element.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.320
It works on desktop, but it
doesn't work on Android.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.610
Now the interesting thing about
this is the answer here

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.550
is, it's a bug.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.420
We've replicated the issue, and
we've found out what the

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.780
issue is, but we don't
have a fix.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.160
Which is not a nice answer
to give people, but

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.640
unfortunately, it's the only
answer that we can give in

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.220
some cases.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.030
So Matt, can we just jump onto
your screen so we can kind of

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:19.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.430
through how we go about
testing this?

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:28.860
MATT GAUNT: So if i just jump
to my desktop, there we go.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.070
So the first step is going to
be to go to Chrome Inspect,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.200
because that's where we're going
to start being able to

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.560
debug this on the
Android device.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.280
It'd be nice to say we
got video load by--

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.830
PAUL KINLAN: Didn't [INAUDIBLE],
sorry.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:46.410
MATT GAUNT: If I hit Inspect
on there, and then I'm also

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.780
going to need to go, can I--

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.260
cool.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.150
So what this is doing is
actually showing the web page

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.040
that I currently have
on my phone.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.050
So if I quickly switch back,
I'll actually be able to show

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.290
you what my phone is doing.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.770
There we--

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:10.890
no.

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.240
No, it's falling apart.

00:19:15.418 --> 00:19:16.780
There we go.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.070
So what we should be able to
see is, this is Pauls demo

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.260
that he's put together.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.400
And basically, all it is, is
just a simple video page with

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.635
a link on it which says
load XHR, just there.

00:19:32.635 --> 00:19:35.670
And when you click on that,
you'll see that the video

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:36.770
[INAUDIBLE] actually come in.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.840
And the problem is when you hit
play, then it's going to

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.830
fail to do anything.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.570
So this then comes
into the bug.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:49.990
So if I dump to SlideShare
again, so the way we debugged

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.420
this was if we actually look
at the sources to the web

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:02.840
page, and I find where we
had the JavaScript.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.130
This one?

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.460
Is this the one?

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.190
And it was as simple as putting
a break point under

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:12.280
this video source window URL.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.240
So now, if I hit refresh on the
mobile device, we should

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.796
get to a point where when
I tap the button--

00:20:19.796 --> 00:20:21.120
there we go.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.190
So at that point, we're
debugging the JavaScript

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:25.785
that's running on the
mobile device.

00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:27.570
And I believe this is what Paul

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.570
used to actually diagnose--

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.200
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.810
So the really nice thing here
was that we used a couple of

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.630
bits of Chrome.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.330
So I use tab sync a
lot inside Chrome.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.760
So I have a desktop, my
desktop instance.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.410
And I'll test it,
make the JS Bin.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.090
And in this case, we just
literally copied all the code

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.800
from the actual "Stack
Overflow" question.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.830
I had to put my own video
in and make it

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.770
cross-origin enabled.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.070
That's not part of the question,
but we just had do

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.290
it to make it work properly.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.800
So we copied all the code in.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.750
And then I tested
it on desktop.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.190
And I just had the debugger
open, went into it.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.870
And it worked.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.080
The video gets cached locally,
or the object gets created and

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.760
then attached to the
video, and then you

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.240
can play the video.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.294
And it's a nice little video of
me smiling and all of that

00:21:15.294 --> 00:21:17.730
type of stuff.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.620
So what happened then is that I
then open up my device, get

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.180
my device open, and use tab sync
so I can just pull the

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.280
page up straightaway, rather
than type the URL in.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.570
And then just connect in, as
Matt showed you a second ago,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:34.850
via the debugger, via Chrome
inspect into the device.

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.520
And then once it was in the
device, I basically just

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.230
tested it to see whether
it worked.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.670
And everything worked
exactly the same, so

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.700
all the events fire.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.220
No errors fire at all.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.970
So it's not a problem
with the JavaScript.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.670
But when you press play,
literally nothing happens.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.290
And if you actually attach a
normal video to it, it just

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:51.790
plays like normal.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.220
So it should work.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.830
It's not an unsupported
video format

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.980
that's causing the issue.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.710
So it was using WebM,
which is fine.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.080
So that's pretty much
all it was.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.780
So we can take this code,
and then we make a bug.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.030
And if you look at the issue
that we've raised, or the

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.500
issue that's on the Stack
Overflow site, we've linked it

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.170
directly to a CR bug
that we've created.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.580
Now the CR bug itself might not
be one that the engineer

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.520
goes off and fixes.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.100
They might get it merged
with a couple of

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.420
other issues fixed.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.070
But normally, this is what
happens when we know that

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.800
there's some functionality that
is missing on the site,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.670
for instance, or inside
Chrome on Android.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.490
We'll then go and raise the bug
because we know there's a

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.770
difference, and there's not
something that we can tell the

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.150
user or the developer to go off
and fix, because there is

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.092
actually no other way that they
can work around this.

00:22:39.092 --> 00:22:41.970
And it's unfortunate, really,
because the developer can't

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.960
actually fix that problem.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.450
So the answer always tells
them, it's a bug.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:48.530
Unfortunately, right now,
it's the correct answer.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.570
And then once we have a fix, we
might go back to the issue

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.800
and then re-edit the answers so
that we can say, hey guys,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.550
this is now fixed.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.790
And this is how we fixed it.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.760
And it's nothing
to do with you.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.430
It's always not you,
basically.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.710
So there we go.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.660
Right.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.830
So there were a couple
of other questions.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.700
Allow me to jump into another
one, which I know that we've

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.080
got an answer to, at least.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.890
I'm going to screen
share again so

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.200
everyone can see the question.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.080
There we go.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.790
So there's a couple here.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:25.430
There's a WebView HTML5
audio length.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:26.350
Unfortunately--

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.030
so the WebView work is going to
take a little bit more time

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.060
for us to investigate because
we need to make an app which

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.960
uses the Android WebView and
then test it out to see if

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.110
it's working.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.600
And there's not a whole lot of
code that we can copy and

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.870
paste inside this,
which is going to

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.220
speed up our diagnosis.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.010
So I'm not sure that's going to
get answered any time soon,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.860
within the next couple
of hours.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.530
But one I really want to bring
this to, there's two in quick

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:56.290
succession on June the 16th
about data URLs and base 64

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.800
encoding and audio, which
is really weird.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.890
Normally, these two things never
happen at the same time,

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.810
but both these questions
have come up.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:05.800
So here.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.250
This says, the following snippet
plays while in Chrome.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.720
Base 64 data, something which
we can't replicate because

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.860
it's specific to their
application, but audio dot

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.150
source, the data file, and some
base 64 encoded data.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.890
Now we got audioPlayer.load and
audioPlayer.play, which

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.080
are the two functions that
you should expect.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.805
And again, the person says, hey,
this works on desktop but

00:24:29.805 --> 00:24:32.290
not on Chrome for Android.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.730
So I'm going to jump
across to, I

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.196
think, another question--

00:24:38.196 --> 00:24:40.320
inside JS Bin.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.075
This is a good advert
for JS Bin.

00:24:42.075 --> 00:24:44.466
It's a pretty awesome tool.

00:24:44.466 --> 00:24:45.934
Here we go.

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:48.660
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.170
on my screen.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.870
But this is how I replicated
the issue today.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.730
So basically, I set up my page
with a button that says play,

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:59.710
an audio file, and
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:00.945
There it is on the page there.

00:25:00.945 --> 00:25:03.160
So you can see it there.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.900
Now there's a whole bunch of
base 64 data across here,

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.615
which is a WAV file that's
been encoded.

00:25:10.615 --> 00:25:13.540
And then I basically try and
replicate exactly what the

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.030
person has actually put in.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.010
So if I press Play here--

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.470
[SOUND EFFECT PLAYING]

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:18.430
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know
whether you can hear it, but

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.900
it's actually playing some
audio in the background.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.470
Now let me just jump out of this
demo because there's not

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.900
a huge amount extra I can
show you on the screen.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.490
But the interesting thing here,
this is another one of

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.980
those examples where
we debug locally.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.360
And you don't even have to debug
too much locally because

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.140
you can hear the sound
getting played.

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.400
But once we have this
reproducible case, we go and

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.150
then hook it up to the
actual device, Chrome

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.370
Inspect, plug it in.

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:47.470
And then I go to my device, my
tab, pull the sync in, and

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.040
then get back up that way.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.340
And then we connect the
debugger just in

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.590
case we need it.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.240
But because we've loaded the
page, I just press Play.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.350
It's not loading.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.910
Now the thing is, now we've got
the debugger connected, I

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.010
basically go and look at the
page to see if all the

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.005
relevant events fire.

00:26:02.005 --> 00:26:03.680
They do.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.230
So we know that things are kind
of starting to happen a

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.390
little bit, but no
audio comes out.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.030
And it feels very similar to
the video issue that we saw

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:16.860
before where you're attaching a
different type of URL to the

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.830
video source element,
but it doesn't play.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.940
Again, I think it's going to be
in the same type of area.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.383
So to cut a long story short,
there's not a huge amount I

00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:29.850
can say about this, is basically
we think there's a

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:34.660
bug inside the actual loading
subsystem, or the load and

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.660
play subsystem of Android
for Chrome.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.450
It's going to be down to an
engineer to try and find out

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:39.800
exactly what that is
at the moment.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.360
But the only thing that we can
say to developers is, we think

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:43.810
it's a bug.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.050
We've raised an issue with
the exact reproducible

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.330
case that we put in.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.500
So the two people who have
raised this issue today, the

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.990
same audio issue, one is a data
URI, and one is about

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:53.990
base 64 encoded.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.240
They are actually the same issue
when you look in the

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.150
line bits of this, is that
we basically just

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.440
said, it's a bug.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.875
Go and track it on this.

00:27:01.875 --> 00:27:03.870
Put any other of your use cases
that you need to get

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:05.330
fixed and follow it.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.036
There's not much else
that we can do.

00:27:07.036 --> 00:27:10.270
And because the developer wants
to generate their audio

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:14.190
file on the client side, which
is why they generate the data

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.940
URIs and the base 64 encoded
URIs, there's not a huge

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.805
amount that we can do to solve
this issue at the moment,

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.160
other than say that.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.470
We could suggest that they go
put it on a server somewhere,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:27.000
but it's not quite right.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.620
I think we're probably getting
close to time.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.920
Is that right, [? Keith? ?]

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.250
MATT GAUNT: Yup, it
looks like it.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.620
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, two or
three minutes left.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.230
So we can answer a couple
more questions.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.200
Matt, I know you were looking
at the media JS or

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.120
MediaElement.js question.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.790
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, so this was
just a really simple question,

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.690
which was essentially, if I
open up the website for

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.260
MediaElement.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.950
What happened was someone had
noticed that when the load up

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.440
the video, there was a button
that was basically going to

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.600
the wrong part of the screen.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.580
It was basically wrapping
onto another line.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:05.070
And it's one of those things
of, it could be perhaps

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.290
something in the layout's
gone wrong.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.296
It could be a hard-coded
value.

00:28:08.296 --> 00:28:12.795
And essentially, all it was was
if you go and look into

00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:17.430
Chrome Inspect again, so I'll
share my screen and inspect my

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.400
mobile device, where I've got
the website up, we can

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.730
actually dig into the source
code for this site.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:31.002
And if I start driving down
through all these things,

00:28:31.002 --> 00:28:32.010
where are we?

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.260
This one.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.410
Down here.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.865
We start drilling down to the
actual control, I believe.

00:28:43.782 --> 00:28:45.610
There we go.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.710
And what you'll see here is we
got a couple of buttons.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:54.200
So if I switch you guys over to
my mobile device, you'll be

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.320
able to see what I'm actually
getting up on my screen.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.570
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:08.310
What you should be able to see
is that little white speck in

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.950
the middle of the blue.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.290
That's the full screen button
that should actually be just

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:15.390
up here on the right
hand side.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:19.835
And if I start digging around in
the DevTools, what you can

00:29:19.835 --> 00:29:21.270
start seeing is, I
actually start

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.370
highlighting certain elements.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.540
So right there is the
full screen button.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.930
But if I actually move the width
of this in DevTools,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.000
it'd just be one
pixel smaller.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.830
You'll see that the actual full
screen button has just

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.070
shifted over.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:44.020
And basically, this is dead
simple to do using DevTools.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.760
Because all I had to do
was just play around

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.910
with a value here.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.510
And that's actually just
shifting the pixel off by one.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:53.960
So it sounds like the problem
that they're getting is just

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.180
the library's just doing
an off by one error.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.570
So it's a case where maybe they
can commit a patch or

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.370
something like that.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.870
But it's simple enough
to do, when

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.090
you've got Chrome Inspect.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.710
Nice and simple to diagnose.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.710
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.670
I know we had some conversation
as well today

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.990
about whether this was a Chrome
issue or a Chrome for

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.530
Android issue or not.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.070
Because I've seen a bug as well
in the past where, on a

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:22.130
new viewported page, the Full
Screen button is minuscule.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.010
So that's where my confusion was
originally when I saw this

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:27.310
was, it's a Chrome for
Android issue.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.900
But as you've seen,
it's actually a

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.790
MediaElement.js issue.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.560
I suppose we could probably
raise the bug.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.490
We just have to make a decision
about what's going to

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.203
get the best level of support
for developers in the end.

00:30:40.203 --> 00:30:41.590
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, thanks,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.840
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, Matt,
you could fix it.

00:30:46.363 --> 00:30:47.690
Cool.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.350
MATT GAUNT: But yeah, this is
generally our flow, isn't it,

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.445
when it comes to fixing bugs?

00:30:50.445 --> 00:30:54.810
It's a case of taking the code
and assessing what's wrong.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.850
But it's also whether it
is something else.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:59.880
PAUL KINLAN: At the moment--

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.300
I'm supposed to wrap
up, in a way.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.160
This, Stack Overflow has become
one of our primary

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.700
mechanisms for supporting
developers.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.100
And we have to make a decision
like, Chrome for mobile, or--

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.670
Chrome for mobile hasn't
got its own tag.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.110
And what we find is that
developers will have Google

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.200
Chrome as one tag and then
Android as another.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.380
And we found that there's a
good intersection of those

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.720
questions that we can actually
support directly for

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.670
developers, in that sense.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.370
So we have a team of our
developer advocates and

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.560
engineers, who we take it on a
rotation to actually start

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.350
answering and making sure that
we're trying to get as much

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.500
support as possible for the
developers out there on it.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.100
Because we're not like dedicated
completely to

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.260
support, if that make sense.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:44.830
We've got a lot of
other issues.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.900
But we want to make sure that
all the developers who

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.890
actually have questions we can
answer in a reasonable time.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:52.620
So the Chrome for Android
platform is the best one that

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.820
you can develop on.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.900
Yeah, so if you do have any
questions that you want to get

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.970
answered, we're trying to
bootstrap the community on

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.890
Stack Overflow to get
more and more people

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:02.900
answering those questions.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.070
But I think for the foreseeable
future, it'll be

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.970
me, Matt, Jake, Chris Wilson,
and Pete, and a couple of

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.000
other people as well, just kind
of providing the support

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.800
to make sure it's there.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.630
Because Chrome for Android
is a new product.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.350
It probably has got some bugs.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.720
And we want to help you work
around them or work--

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.130
fix your products in case
it isn't a bug and

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.135
it's a fix in logic.

00:32:23.135 --> 00:32:26.960
But right now, today, there's
been three bugs raised to the

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.820
Chrome team because of the
questions that came through

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:29.990
Stack Overflow.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.180
So yeah.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.900
I think that's it.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.020
Matt, do you have anything
else before we finish?

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.040
MATT GAUNT: No, I'd just say
it's just ridiculously useful

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.450
for us also to kind of find
these weird quirks that you

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:41.560
guys are experiencing, becaues
it means that we can find ways

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.730
to fix them and then also
feed them back.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:44.960
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.590
And if you can, if you can help
us help you, more code

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:52.095
and samples, if you can.

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:53.910
But if not, we'll just
delve down and dig

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.590
down into the problem.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:57.190
So thank you.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.330
And see you again soon.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.930
MATT GAUNT: Cheers, everyone.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.180
Bye.
