PAUL KINLAN: Hi everyone.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.780
Welcome to Mobile
Web Thursdays.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.160
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And I'm
Jake Archibald.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.320
Thank you for tuning in.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.620
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.310
That's right, actually.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.750
That was actually pretty good.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.150
I'm getting the hang
of this TV thing.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.670
PAUL KINLAN: He's been
planning that for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.650
about two hours now.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh,
it's very good.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.670
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm very
happy with myself.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.890
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.100
So we're also known as
the Chuckle Brothers.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.640
And today we're going to be
talking about Mobile Web

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.640
Performance.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.890
Right?

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.300
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.080
PAUL KINLAN: So shall
we get started?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.710
Why not?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.350
One of the things that really
bugs me when people talk about

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.590
mobile performance is they're
either treating mobiles as

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.405
this special thing--

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:15.050
And mobiles really aren't
that special, right?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.990
OK, they're touch.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.840
But touch isn't just mobile.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.570
We've got Chromebook
Pixel here.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.310
That's got touch.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.170
These Windows devices
are the same.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.080
PAUL KINLAN: Is that touch?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.012
It is a Mac.

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:26.550
It's not touch.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.680
You could say, oh,
cellular data.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.360
That's mobile.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.950
But it's not.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.670
Because once again, people run
their laptops off MiFis,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640
things like that.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.520
And sometimes your phone is
quite often on WiFi data.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.390
In fact, some small devices
like your Nexus 7s or your

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.860
iPod Touches, they don't have
cellular data on all

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.530
models of them do.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.030
Mobiles are really just smaller
and less power than a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.680
main desktop machine.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.870
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Wouldn't
you say?

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.110
It's kind of interesting.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.460
I think what's starting to lead
us to what we're trying

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.266
to talk about today is that
we were at Educomm--

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:04.370
It was Educomm, wasn't it?-- and
I think Facebook said that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.140
they noticed a significant drop
off of interaction based

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.930
off the change of frame rate
between 60 frames a second

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.440
down to 30 frames a second.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040
And the slower and the jankier
the experience was actually

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.920
inside the application, the less
engagement that they got,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.510
which got us thinking about--

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.330
well, we've been doing it for a
little while now-- but we're

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.670
starting to push more about
this jank-free--

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.980
I've got to say that correctly,
because I can never

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.100
say that quite right--

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.300
experience where you'll
get 60 frames a second

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.240
experience on mobile.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.060
And a lot of people
think you can't.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.930
We think you can.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.880
And I think we're going to try
and show you today some of the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.290
gotchas, the how-tos,
the wherefores.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.496
What else can we say?

00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:49.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, if you
serve just a lump of HTML to a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.900
phone, it works.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.280
It works quite well, and
it runs quite fast.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.820
So saying how to make something
faster in mobile

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.670
isn't really the right
thing to say.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.010
We're saying how not to make it
slow, because it's fast to

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.550
begin with.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.250
As developers, we're the
ones who make it slow.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.870
So I don't swear very
much as a person.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.770
Is that fair to say?

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.430
PAUL KINLAN: No.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.150
You do.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.490
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.060
Maybe I do.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.570
But I've been told that--

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.000
PAUL KINLAN: He's worried,
by the way.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.150
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --I'm really
not allowed to.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.045
And when you're told you're
not allowed--

00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:23.580
PAUL KINLAN: Beep.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --my brain's
like the back of a

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.330
teenager's math book.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.110
It's absolutely disgusting
right now.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.870
And when you're told you
are one syllable away

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.350
from losing your job--

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.810
So you're going to
help, right?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:34.280
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.210
As I say, we've got this
preemptive beep machine.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So you're
going to beep.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.760
PAUL KINLAN: I'm
going to beep.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.450
We haven't got a proper one,
so I have to go beep.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.170
I get a twitch in my eye
when I'm about--

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.190
PAUL KINLAN: I've
been watching.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --to
drop a word bomb.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.280
So watch out for that.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.110
PAUL KINLAN: On that note--

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Actually,
shut the fridge door.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.350
See?

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.740
I thought I would let
you in there.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.990
That was a test.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.850
I wasn't actually
going to swear.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.210
PAUL KINLAN: Dude, I know.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But
you missed.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.640
I thought you were going
to be here for me.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.170
PAUL KINLAN: I'm going to be
preemptive when I know you are

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.750
going to do it.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.610
And I knew you weren't
going to do it, so I

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.440
wasn't going to do it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
we'll see.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.640
We'll see if I've got a job
at the end of this.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.730
Let's take a look
at an example.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.610
All that stuff I was saying
before about mobiles not being

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.490
special, we're going to look
at a case where they are

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.230
special just to prove
myself wrong.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.070
So if we can take a look at
what's on my desktop machine

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.600
and look at the first
demo we have here--

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.750
PAUL KINLAN: Can I just say
before we start, we have a

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.400
Moderator where people can
actually ask questions.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.950
We should have the link
on the screen

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.420
somewhere at the bottom.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.810
Yeah.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.940
So you can go and ask us
questions, and we'll answer

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.880
them at the end of the show.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.770
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.550
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Let's do that.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.410
PAUL KINLAN: So shall we get
doing what you're going to do?

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.120
So I'm in JSbin for
our first demo.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.760
So what we have here
is a series of devs

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.090
all of the same class.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.840
It's a really dumb
and simple demo.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.300
And the JavaScript here, all
that's going to do is it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.720
going to loop through all
of those elements.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.870
It's going to give
them a hue value.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.160
It's going to cycle through all
360 and create this kind

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.580
of rainbow effect here.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.720
Now when you click on them using
ClickListener here, it's

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.210
going to swap that to the
opposite side of the hue.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.280
So what we get is click,
click, click,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.630
and it will go back.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.860
So that's how it works
on desktop.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.730
It's really fast.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.850
But let's have a look at
how it works on mobile.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.790
So if we can switch to
the mobile view--

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.910
This is running on
a Nexus 7, but it

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.850
runs the same on phones.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.600
So here it is.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.400
As you can see, it's
scrolling.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.680
We get pinch zoom.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.560
That's fine.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.730
And I tap on it, and
it changes color.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.410
But it's really, really slow.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.520
And I was saying before that
mobiles are not as fast as

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.930
desktop machines, but they're
not that slow.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.620
Painting a rectangle different
colors is not really a task

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.630
any device should
struggle with

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.390
So what's happening here is
click events actually run with

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.030
a 300 millisecond
delay on mobile.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.305
Now I'll show you why
that happens.

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:08.020
If we have a look at
Google Moderator--

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.120
Google Moderator is a site that
isn't really optimized

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.380
well for mobile, so no points
to us there for that--

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.430
Apple came up with this
interaction where they would

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.320
start with the screen
zoomed out.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.440
And if you wanted to zoom in to
a part of it, you could use

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.250
a pinch zoom, but you
could also do this.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.650
You could double-tap.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.890
You could double-tap it.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.620
It zooms in.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.800
And all of the others mobile
devices have copied that.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
And this is our problem.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.610
Because how do we know if you're
going to double-tap

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.590
when you tap?

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.260
Well, the only way we can do
that is by just having a

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.430
little wait and seeing
what you do next.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.230
And if you don't tap again,
that's not a double-tap.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.570
It's said that if you want
something to seem instant it

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.960
has to happen within 100
milliseconds of the user

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.200
clicking the thing.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.790
And with 300 milliseconds added
to start of that, you're

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.500
three times over budget
before you've run any

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.380
JavaScript at all.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.510
But we can use JavaScript
to work around that.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.650
PAUL KINLAN: I know some of the
guys who are working on

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.500
the touch side of things are
trying to improve this even

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.070
for normal viewports.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.870
Because if you can detect that
you're at full zoom, for

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.660
instance, then you're not
going to try and do the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.695
double-tap in.

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:21.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.980
PAUL KINLAN: And there's
questions about whether we can

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.910
optimize that experience so that
we don't have to actually

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.726
have a viewport if you don't
want to have a viewport, and

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:28.190
all this type stuff.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:28.530
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.990
And if there's anything else you
want to spoil ahead of me

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.710
getting around to it--

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:32.320
PAUL KINLAN: Am I
spoiling things?

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --that's fine.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.540
Tell you what--

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.710
PAUL KINLAN: You've got all
the lines down here.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --I could leave
if you just want to read

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.320
from my notes.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.880
That's fine.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.440
PAUL KINLAN: Well, there's
something about the FT

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.790
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No, don't
talk about the FT.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.430
PAUL KINLAN: You told
me to read ahead.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You nearly
made me do one of those

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.700
job-ending noises.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.530
OK.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.840
Actually, let's take a look at
the desktop machine, and I can

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.630
show the code for this one.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.360
It's number three.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.740
So this code looks exactly--

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.310
PAUL KINLAN: That's
a nice code.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:01.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --the same.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.160
It's a lovely code.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.040
It's my favorite.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.800
I spent at least a few minutes
writing it yesterday.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.790
So here's the difference.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.510
This one isn't click.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.080
It's touchend.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.880
So it's using a touch event.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.860
It doesn't work on
the desktop.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.860
You would have to add a click
event in as well.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.330
If we can switch to the phone,
you can see the difference it

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.120
makes here.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.310
So I can scroll around
the page.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.720
And if I tap, it changes.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.450
And as you see, it's happening
instantly.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.530
So we've got a real performance
boost out of that.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.600
This is on Chrome for Android.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.679
We'll take a look at
the same thing

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:39.840
running in another browser.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.400
I should point out this
is not my Nexus.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.820
I'm not a fitness fanatic, and
I wasn't planning on having a

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.630
nipple slip this early on
in the presentation.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.570
PAUL KINLAN: It's my Nexus.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.810
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Is
that your Nexus?

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.640
PAUL KINLAN: It's my test one.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm just going
to grab him by the nipple and

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.236
fling him away.

00:08:59.236 --> 00:09:00.090
Excellent.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.310
So let's go into Firefox, and
let's have a look at the same

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.230
URL and site.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.790
In fact, do I have
it prepared?

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.250
Oh, that's lovely.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.460
So this is the same thing.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.900
We're using the touch event.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.820
And so if I tap, it works.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.790
But as I scroll, when I let
go it still getting

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.820
that touch end event.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.050
And this is not Firefox
doing it wrong.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.810
In fact, the default old Android
browser does the same.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.310
iOS Safari does the same.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.990
In fact, Chrome's kind of the
one doing it different.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.405
And it's not going
against the spec.

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:37.200
It's just unspeced behavior.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.920
It doesn't say whether a touch
sequence should be cancelled

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.296
if a scroll starts.

00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:45.260
PAUL KINLAN: Does it happen
in Safari as well?

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.880
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes,
in Safari on iOS.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.070
Yeah.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.600
PAUL KINLAN: Does it match
Chrome's behavior, or does it

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.290
match Firefox's?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.380
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It matches
Firefox's behavior.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.830
PAUL KINLAN: It's actually
something that we're doing

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.010
inside the browser ourselves.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.800
Chrome is the exception.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.480
By doing what I would
say would be to the

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.300
right thing to do--

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.435
Once you've started doing a
scroll, then I don't want to

00:10:05.435 --> 00:10:08.460
hear about the touch, because
the browser's taken over

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.880
handling touch events.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.090
But yeah, no one's actually
breaking the spec.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.720
It's unspecified behavior.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.120
We do have a fix for this
in the form of the

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.055
Pointer Events spec.

00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:21.500
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.475
It's something Microsoft came
up with and is now being

00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:25.590
worked through w3.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.980
And that explicitly says--

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.670
and we'll include
a link to this--

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:35.300
that if you do a zoom or a pan
or a scroll then you get touch

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.070
cancel events, and you
won't get a touchend

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.310
or a pointer end.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.690
It's not touch.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.460
So that's something for the
future, but it's doesn't

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.770
really help us now,
unfortunately.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.800
And I think we're much more
concerned with now.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.995
PAUL KINLAN: So do you know if
there's many sites that are

00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:51.950
using touchend for this?

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.700
Is it mainly--?

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.510
Because most people find out
that it's going to cause that

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.300
kind of problem.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.300
We do get some problems with
sites where they've got an

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.390
instance of Google Maps
halfway down the page.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.840
If you've got that full width,
someone will be scrolling down

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.400
the page, and then they'll
hit their finger on

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.230
the Google Maps bit.

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.270
And now all their touch events
are going into Google Maps.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.790
It's not a very good
experience.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.960
PAUL KINLAN: So I do have
one question for you.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Go for it.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.745
PAUL KINLAN: If you have a
touchstart on the same range

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.320
of elements that you're
in there, does the

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.570
behavior match Firefox?

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.550
Because it feels like if you're
that you've got a

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.690
touchstart events
you'd definitely

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.250
want a touchend event.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.570
JAKE ARCHIBALD: If you have
a touchstart event and you

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.910
cancel it using
event.preventdefault, then

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.970
it's saying that you are
now in charge of

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.250
all of those events.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.830
So you will get the
entire sequence.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.490
There is another way
we can fix this.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.700
So let's go back
to the desktop.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.140
PAUL KINLAN: Is this what I
ruined before, by any chance?

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.730
No?

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:51.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.940
Yes, it is.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.430
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, OK.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.520
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.630
This is the one you ruined.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.040
Let's have a look
at number four.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.930
So this is going to
go back to click.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.080
So yeah, we've got that.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.880
Click back there.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.230
But in the HTML we have
a difference.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:09.180
We've got this meta viewport
here, but it's fixed.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.980
So I'm not going to be
able to pinch zoom.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.820
So let's go back to
the mobile view.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.935
I'm going to go to number six.

00:12:20.935 --> 00:12:22.920
I'm not as dexterous
at this distance.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.740
Tell you what, let me just pick
it from the link here.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.200
So we're going for fixed.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.920
PAUL KINLAN: Preparation?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's brilliant,
isn't it?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.390
All right.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.350
There we go.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.345
So I can't pinch zoom
the viewport.

00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:34.740
It's fixed.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.820
But the taps or click, even
just using the click event

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.490
which was slow before,
it's now fast.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.190
And that's because we know as
a browser double-tap has no

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.080
meaning here.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.680
So we don't have to wait
around for it.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.800
We can take the fast path.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.190
PAUL KINLAN: There's a film
called "Double Tap."

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:48.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I've
never seen it.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.660
PAUL KINLAN: It was rubbish.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.070
So we do this.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.880
This is something that Chrome
for Android does.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.530
Firefox does it as well.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.680
Unfortunately the other
browsers, including--

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.820
PAUL KINLAN: I think we've just
done an article in HTML5

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.470
Rocks about the interaction
between touch and click.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.440
And that's one of the bits of
research that we did where we

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:13.190
were testing which browsers when
you had a viewport set

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.170
the ability just to have
straight through.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.440
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.350
And as you were saying, this
is one of the things that

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.760
we're looking at.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.210
Because having a fixed
viewport is OK.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.230
But it can be nice a nice
accessibility feature you get

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.200
for free in the browser to
be able to pinch zoom in.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.670
So it's worth keeping.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.730
So we're looking at ways--
there's a ticket.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.290
We'll post a link to that--
where we're discussing in what

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:41.330
cases can we decide the user's
not going to do a double-tap

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.040
here, so we don't have
to wait for it.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.184
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:13:43.184 --> 00:13:43.520
That's right.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.440
So I think on the performance
side this doesn't necessarily

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.930
seem performance related.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:48.940
But it is, right?

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.730
It's the first thing that people
encounter when they're

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.525
trying to build applications
and sites on mobile.

00:13:55.525 --> 00:13:57.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.170
PAUL KINLAN: This is the
slow bit, right?

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.450
It's not slow because the
hardware can't handle it.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:02.260
It's just slow because of the
way we programmed it, right?

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.570
If you told the network guys
we have a trick that will

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:12.460
shave 300 milliseconds off the
delivery time, they would jump

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.505
all over you to get it.

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:18.280
And here we are in mobile with
every click taking that long.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.650
And this is not just
a JavaScript issue.

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.570
These examples have all been
JavaScript, but even just a

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.110
link on a page is going to
have that 300 millisecond

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.980
delay unless you're using
a fixed viewport.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.560
There is a workaround
that works today.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.360
PAUL KINLAN: Is this
the bit now?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.625
JAKE ARCHIBALD: This
is the FT bit.

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:34.100
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.120
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Actually,
you haven't spoiled

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.330
anything after that.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.730
PAUL KINLAN: Well, I can see all
the rest of your script.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.580
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, OK.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.750
Well, we're getting to
the end of this page.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.880
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.250
It might ruin your next
joke, by the way.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.066
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, great.

00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:46.290
I nearly did a swear again.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:46.810
OK.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:48.260
Let's have a look
on the mobile.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:54.080
I'm going to switch
over to fastclick.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.100
So this is using a zoomable
viewport, and it's really,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.160
really fast.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.240
So I'll show you what's
happening on the desktop

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:06.620
machine, if we switch
over to that.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.160
So this is using a bit of drop
in JavaScript from the FT.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.450
And if I switch into
the Edit view--

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:16.770
Excellent.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.220
So the difference here is I'm
dumping in a fastclick, which

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.320
is a script written by the FT.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.060
We'll put a link to
their GitHub page.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.460
And in JavaScript
it's right here.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.610
This is just this one line
saying I want fastclick to

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.630
work for the body.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.910
And what they do is they're
just going to use the

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:41.370
touchstart to touchend events,
but when you let go they're

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.590
going to look how far
you traveled while

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.110
you were doing that.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.260
And if you've traveled over a
certain distance, they'll go,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.990
ah, that's not a tap
really, is it?

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.160
That's not a click.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.520
You were doing a scroll or some
other kind of gesture.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.820
And it's a large script.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.820
There's a lot of edge cases,
a lot of browser bugs that

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.950
they've worked around.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.860
So I'm sure they'd agree the
quicker we can kill that

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.075
script, the better.

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:05.980
As soon as we can get all
browsers up to date or have a

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.740
way that we can work
around this--

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.820
this click delay thing--

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.340
the better.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.960
But it's really the best we've
got at the moment.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.270
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.280
I think that's touch.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.810
Ah, well, we can deal with the
touch questions when we get

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.370
them in the Moderator.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.170
So we want to pull up the link
for the Moderator again, just

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.920
so if you want to ask questions
there it is.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That was good.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.170
PAUL KINLAN: Was
it timed well?

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.730
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That was
a real TV thing.

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.350
Pow.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.790
PAUL KINLAN: I want to be
like that guy on YouTube

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.960
that you showed me.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.630
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.890
We'll put a link to
that as well.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:35.230
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.695
We should do, actually.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:37.130
It's pretty good.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.410
Yeah.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.060
So do you want to go on
to your next bit--

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:39.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.770
PAUL KINLAN: --bearing in mind
that we haven't got a huge

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.650
amount of time left.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: We don't?

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.040
Or we do?

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.640
PAUL KINLAN: Not really.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:44.980
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Not really.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.680
PAUL KINLAN: You can go over.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Ah,
we can go over.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.420
PAUL KINLAN: It's not
like proper TV.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:48.045
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm
having good fun.

00:16:48.045 --> 00:16:48.910
Are you having fun?

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.780
I'm having fun.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:50.470
Are you having fun?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.550
PAUL KINLAN: Moderator
says no.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Ah.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.590
Oh, dear.

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:54.640
PAUL KINLAN: Someone did say,
did you just swear?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.450
Or was that a nipple
I just saw?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There
was a nipple.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.090
There wasn't a swear, though,
so I still keep my job.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.690
That's what's important.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:07.650
So let's have a look at our
graphical performance demo.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.390
So if we could bring
up the desktop,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.378
if we haven't already.

00:17:11.378 --> 00:17:14.004
PAUL KINLAN: You forgot
to [CLICKS FINGERS].

00:17:14.004 --> 00:17:14.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There we go.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.980
OK.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.730
I'm going to reset that.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.319
This is snakes on a
geometric plane.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.839
PAUL KINLAN: I like that.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
good, isn't it?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.900
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.950
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm very, very
pleased with myself.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.000
So as you see, these things
are moving around.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.340
And we're moving around
using a CSS animation.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.702
I'll go into the Edit
screen for this.

00:17:34.702 --> 00:17:35.160
Yeah.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.880
So this is the automation
it's using right here.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.370
Let's bump up the size
of it there.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.712
So it's just going around the
top and the left, and it's

00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:46.260
going to animate around.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.430
So the performance isn't so
good, even on desktop.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.000
So let's take a look
at it full screen.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.450
I'm going to bring up
Chrome's devtools.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.620
Actually, let's do that now.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.080
So let's bump up the
size there as well.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.460
So I can run this.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.150
This is the timeline.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.570
And what happens here if
I start recording--

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.950
PAUL KINLAN: I'm going to say
one thing in a second about

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.530
the timeline is that not enough
people use it, and not

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.425
enough people know about it.

00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:19.400
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's the
best thing we've

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.040
added to the Tools.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.600
PAUL KINLAN: Everyone seems to
go to the Heap Profiler and

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.380
the CPU Profiler.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Don't do that.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.580
It's rubbish.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.090
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.040
And Paul Lewis, one of our other
colleagues, is really

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.900
big on this at the moment.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.735
He's basically saying
all the time that--

00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:30.915
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's huge.

00:18:30.915 --> 00:18:31.340
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.140
It's big.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.240
It's where it's at.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.840
It's got two turntables
and a microphone.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.550
But anyway, the actual thing
I was going to say was the

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.870
biggest problem that we face
are at the moment around

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.280
compositor, rendering, and
understanding when the layout

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.780
changes inside your app.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.630
PAUL KINLAN: I know you're going
to talk about this now.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.320
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well,
this is it.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.810
You see the problems
we've got here.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.270
PAUL KINLAN: JavaScript
Performance, deal with it when

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.800
you get to it.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.110
But you can get a lot out of
this rendering performance.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.940
You can see the problem here
is all we've got these huge

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.460
panes operations that
are happening.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.440
But let's take a look at it on
mobile, because that's what

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.450
we're here for.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.380
So if we switch over to the
mobile view, I'm going to open

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:07.840
the same thing.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.770
Here we go.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.570
Let's see if I can actually
click a button.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.575
PAUL KINLAN: So you've
prepared devtools?

00:19:12.575 --> 00:19:14.130
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I haven't
prepared devtools,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:14.770
but I'm going to.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.690
But we can see on the mobile
view that the performance, it

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.660
was bad on desktop, but
it's just really

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.890
suffering on mobile.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.860
PAUL KINLAN: And this is what we
were saying at the start is

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.230
these devices are probably about
one tenth of the speed

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.400
of your normal desktop
machine.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:27.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.540
About that.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.430
They're going to keep getting
faster, but they're always

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.700
going to be behind what's
inside your much bigger

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.240
desktop machine.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.940
And this is the thing.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.650
Compared to some laptops,
we've both got

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.700
high density screens.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.920
But in the normal laptops, your
mobile devices sometimes

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.810
have the same amount of pixels,
or near the same

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.820
amount of pixels, but much
less hardware driving it.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:49.800
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So I'm
going to connect

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.350
devtools up to this.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.340
We're going to do a proper
session on devtools, right?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.310
PAUL KINLAN: We'll probably
rope Addie in

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.110
or someone as well.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.390
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.480
I don't want to do that.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.320
So the way you activate devtools
is you connect via

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.730
USB with your phone.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.430
If we can bring up the desktop
view, I'll show you.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.750
PAUL KINLAN: Why were you
pinged in google.com?

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.160
Did you have network problems
earlier [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Let's
just go away.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:12.760
It wasn't that we were panicking
for about 15 minutes

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.910
before we started.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.850
PAUL KINLAN: We had no network
before we started.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.330
And considering this
is a live show, we

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.180
had a bit of a crisis.

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.660
It was like an adventure.

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:22.880
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.760
It was exactly what I wanted for
my first time doing this.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.290
Nearly swore again.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.075
So if you want to, you put USB
debugging mode on your device.

00:20:33.075 --> 00:20:34.830
You connect via USB.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.360
We'll cover this properly
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.210
And there's this very intuitive
command you put in.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.920
It's that.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.360
And I don't know about you,
but that was the first--

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.050
PAUL KINLAN: You might need to
make it a little bit bigger

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.851
for everyone, if you can.

00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:48.672
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, people
just need to look closer.

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:49.695
Get closer to your screens.

00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:50.270
PAUL KINLAN: Manual zoom.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.240
Move your head closer
to the screen.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.530
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.010
So I don't know about you, but
that was the first word that

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.990
came out of my mouth when
I was born, that

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.310
adb forward tcp colon.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.000
PAUL KINLAN: Well, I've just
been with it for while now.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Am I allowed
to say colon?

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.070
PAUL KINLAN: Colon is fine.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.330
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.510
That's good.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.220
And then it will say, Error.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.560
Device Not Found.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.410
And this is going to probably
cause me some grief as I start

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.290
to do this demo.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.560
Let's see if it's just by
coincidence working.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.770
No, not at all.

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:17.460
That's good.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.920
So what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to unplug it.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.966
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:21:21.966 --> 00:21:23.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And then I'm
going to plug it back in, and

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.000
I'm going to see
what that does.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.520
PAUL KINLAN: I have
full faith in you.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's fine.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.940
Do you know what?

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:28.660
I'm OK.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.210
PAUL KINLAN: I want you to
do more shows later on.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:36.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I could start
crying at some point soon.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.590
Let's close Chrome.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.674
PAUL KINLAN: Did you
have Chrome up?

00:21:38.674 --> 00:21:39.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I did
have Chrome up.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.160
PAUL KINLAN: We'll
do ADB Devices.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.230
So we might as well tell
everyone what's happening now.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.570
So this is the you've got
no devices attached.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.637
So the way that you actually
connect devtools to Chrome and

00:21:50.637 --> 00:21:54.180
Chrome on devtools is
via the Android

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.290
Development Kit at the moment.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.500
And there's a tool inside
the Android

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.090
Development Kit called ADB.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.240
Cool.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.510
We've got it working now.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.360
So ADB Devices lists
all of the devices

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.000
connected to your machine.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.090
So there might be a
couple of them.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.740
And Jake is going to take the
leap of faith, and it's

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.010
worked, I think.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.560
He's run ADB forward.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.060
And ADB forward basically says
we're going to forward a

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:19.050
special port, TCP 922, to all
those connections straight to

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.670
this or the host, called local
abstract Chrome devtools.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.590
Now that itself is the devtools
instance running

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.820
inside the actual browser.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:28.790
So what you might notice is
that your devtools inside

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.210
Chrome appears different to the
devtools that you'd get

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.650
when you debug a device.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.740
And that's because I think the
device that you're on,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.580
the URL says 25.

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.940
You're at M25 there, and you
might be on Canary on your

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.450
desktop, which is at 26 or 27.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.170
So we're basically forwarding
all the

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:45.600
requests to that device.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.550
And that device is serving up
devtools for us, and then we

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:49.538
go from there.

00:22:49.538 --> 00:22:51.210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yep.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.100
PAUL KINLAN: That was actually a
pretty good save, wasn't it?

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.190
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That was
a really good fill.

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.710
I'm very happy about that.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.040
And by the way, the solution
there was to unplug it and

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.890
plug it back in, just
the other end of it.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.220
Anyway so what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to pick up

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.310
one of these things that's
moving around.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.930
So if we're on the desktop view,
we can see that I've got

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.930
this magnifying glass here.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:11.930
I'm going to click that.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.530
And then I can just tap on the
actual device, if I can catch

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.700
one of these snakes,
and it's going to

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:17.820
bring up that element.

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:18.600
It's such a simple thing.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.520
I really like that.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.390
Anyway, what I'm going to
do is a horrible hack.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:30.610
And I'm going to do webkit
transform and then

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.140
translate Z, 0.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.380
And if we watch what happens on
the screen, as you can see

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:39.240
the performance has just
gone much, much better.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.620
In fact, let's not guess
what frame raise it is.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.030
Let's run devtools here.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:45.310
OK.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.430
We're not perfect.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.380
PAUL KINLAN: You're not at the
full 30 frames a second but--

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:48.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.170
It actually visually looks a
little bit faster than that.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:53.000
And maybe devtools itself
was making it slower.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.540
But the important thing is the
paints have gone, and we've

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.315
got compositing instead.

00:23:58.315 --> 00:23:59.610
PAUL KINLAN: Can we describe
this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:59.610 --> 00:23:59.710
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.380
PAUL KINLAN: I don't always
pay attention to you.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:01.780
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.630
That's fine.

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.810
So I'm Barry.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.740
Pleased to meet you.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:08.220
Welcome.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.290
You're in a studio.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:10.610
Everything is OK.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.180
The bright lights are OK.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.480
There are three lights.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:14.534
PAUL KINLAN: No.

00:24:14.534 --> 00:24:14.790
I was going to say.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There
are four lights.

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.910
PAUL KINLAN: There's actually
four lights.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.500
That reminds me of the t-shirt
you were looking at before.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.330
Yeah, so this user interface,
I'm pointing at a screen which

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.590
you can't see me point
at properly.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.550
But anyway, there's two lines,
60 and 30, and they kind of

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.620
vary based on the actual
frame rate that

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.470
you're actually getting.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:31.170
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.620
PAUL KINLAN: Because if you're
getting a really slow frame

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.270
rate-- and we've seen
applications that get like a

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.570
quarter of a frame a second--

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.240
you don't even see the
60 frame a second.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.010
The 30 frame a second
line's there.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.370
But this gives you a great
indication about how fast your

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.240
application's running
on the frame rate.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:44.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.320
And the fix we applied there
is by applying hardware

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.650
rendering to all of
those objects.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.200
So I'm going to try and explain
difference between

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.120
software and hardware rendering
to you really,

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.070
really quickly.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.060
So imagine you have
a wall, OK?

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.250
A big white wall.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.690
And you're going to do
a painting on it.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.020
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So you get your
bucket of magenta paint

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.620
and your paint brush, and
you draw your shape.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.640
And you stand back, and
you think, wow.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.800
That's brilliant.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.870
Oh, except it's a little bit
too far to the right.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:19.460
I want to move it to the left.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.110
The problem is you
painted a wall.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.670
PAUL KINLAN: So you're saying
I knock the wall down and

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:23.630
build it up again?

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, you'll
need to repaint

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.550
the wall white again.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:26.150
Paint the wall white.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.530
PAUL KINLAN: That's actually
even more efficient than what

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.060
I was going to do.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Exactly.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.220
Yeah.

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.250
PAUL KINLAN: So that would
be software rendering.

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.620
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.520
And then you paint it again.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.930
PAUL KINLAN: What would my
mechanism be, then, knocking

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:34.300
down the wall?

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.430
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Knocking down
the well, we're talking IE 5.5

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.410
Mac there

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:38.630
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, OK.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:42.210
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think
that's what they did.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.560
But in hardware rendering, what
you would do is put a

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.130
piece of Perspex
over the wall.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.445
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:25:46.445 --> 00:25:48.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You would
do your painting again.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.850
And then if you wanted to move
it, you would just be able to

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:51.580
move the Perspex.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:54.320
In fact, you could add multiple
layers of Perspex and

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.930
draw stuff on there, and
then moving around

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.710
becomes really cheap.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.740
If you wanted to change
something else about it, like

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.730
the color or the shape, you've
still got to do some painting,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.310
but moving becomes really,
really cheap.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.250
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:06.720
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.540
Did that work?

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:08.540
PAUL KINLAN: That was actually
pretty good.

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:09.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
was excellent.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.770
PAUL KINLAN: As you can tell,
I'm not that clever.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.573
I was actually going to
knock a wall down.

00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:16.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Well, we
might do that later on.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.300
We could finish with that.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.400
We could knock this well
down, if you want.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.570
That sounds like a
good way to end.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.750
PAUL KINLAN: With the amount of
trouble we had getting this

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.575
place ready first--

00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:23.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
true, actually.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.000
Well, yeah.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.980
So if we look at the mobile
phone view, I've put this

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:28.790
button in the middle.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.540
This wasn't a life suggestion.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.510
Go out and do something.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.400
No, this is a button.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.430
And this is going to spend a
second-- there it goes--

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.690
worth of JavaScript time
doing a thing.

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.750
And you can see there the
animation stops as well.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.130
We can actually improve on
that and improve on the

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.150
animation performance as well.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.340
We saw with the code
we had before--

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:54.768
Let's go back to the desktop
view where I can show that.

00:26:54.768 --> 00:26:57.630
Let's get ride of devtools.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.190
Come on, JSbin, don't
fail me now.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.470
Right.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.005
So this is the animation
we're doing.

00:27:02.005 --> 00:27:04.150
And it's using top and left.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.540
But we could alternatively
animate using

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.550
transforms like this.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.400
And if we go to the phone now
or the Nexus, I'm going to

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.780
make that happen, if
I can remember how.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.180
Here we go.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.830
Here's our animation name.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.450
And I believe it was
around transform.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:25.810
PAUL KINLAN: I was laughing at
you earlier, because I was

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:26.385
like, oh, you made a mistake.

00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:27.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:27.900
Bug in devtools.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.830
That should be crossed out.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.830
Yep.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.270
This should actually be
webkit-animation-delay, which

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.920
is what's being set here, which
is why each circle is

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.340
slightly off from
the other one.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.722
And that creates a snake.

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:39.630
So now our performance has
actually gotten much better.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.390
PAUL KINLAN: --on a
geometric plane.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:42.855
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, so
happy about that.

00:27:42.855 --> 00:27:45.480
And if we run devtools
now, look at that.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.520
And in fact, I think
it's actually

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.550
at 60 frames a second.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.070
It just gets slower when we're
actually recording.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.530
One of those Heisenbugs.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:51.950
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:52.850
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And we've
got no paints.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.670
We've got no recalculations.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.180
We're just doing composites on

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.810
hardware, and that's brilliant.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.480
And furthermore, if I press
this Do Something button,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.300
JavaScript is still going to
block for a second, but the

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.250
animation's like don't care.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.580
I'm doing my own things.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:08.690
Don't care about what
JavaScript's doing.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.930
That's kind of cool.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.610
We'd all like to not care
about JavaScript

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.440
every now and then.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.390
PAUL KINLAN: I don't even
care about most

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.050
things half the time.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:16.990
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
all right.

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.660
I don't even care about you.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.820
Nearly did a swear.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.420
OK.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.740
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.320
I think that's kind
of interesting.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.125
I've not seen too many people
use devtools, especially for

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:30.290
performance profiling.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.540
And that's one of the things
that we definitely want to

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.710
encourage is people to
use more of devtools.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.380
You get the same kind of
interface exactly against

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.990
these devices.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.710
I would say that if you email
me, paulkinlan@google.com, if

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.440
you have any ideas about how
you'd like to use devtools and

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.220
what you'd like to be able to
actually interact with these

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.690
devices better than we can
now, please let us know.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.760
We'll file that feedback
directly to the team.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.510
Yeah.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.730
That's the biggest thing I want
to get out today is we

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.200
actually want feedback
when people start

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.950
building these things.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.030
And we want you to go and
play with this as well.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.640
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.700
I don't want people to start
thinking of that translate Z

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.500
thing as a--

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.105
Silver bullet?

00:29:10.105 --> 00:29:10.650
Golden bullet?

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.520
We'll call it a golden bullet.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:11.950
PAUL KINLAN: Silverfinger?

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.935
Is Goldenfinger silver bullet?

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:14.820
I don't know.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.600
We got into trouble
doing something--

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:16.840
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.260
Let's not.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.320
PAUL KINLAN: Let's
leave this one.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.470
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Let's talk
about something else.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.400
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In fact,
I think [INAUDIBLE]--

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.870
PAUL KINLAN: It's
not a panacea.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:23.950
Is that a word?

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:24.410
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I don't know.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.540
That's out of my vocabulary.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.620
Can I talk about mobiles?

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:27.920
Is that OK?

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.330
Is that OK with you?

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:30.030
PAUL KINLAN: We're actually
running out of time, but I'm

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.600
trying to--

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Right.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.235
Let me do this demo
really quickly.

00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:34.620
PAUL KINLAN: And then we'll
move to questions.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And then we'll
move to questions.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.600
PAUL KINLAN: We need about
10 minutes for questions.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:36.870
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:37.920
That's fine.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.300
I've gone back to the slow
demo on the phone.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.690
And what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to turn off some

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:47.020
of the effects that
are going on here.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.450
So we've got a shadow and
the border radius.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.150
And as we turn those off--

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.720
we're just software
rendering now--

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.420
things have got lot quicker.

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.230
And I'm also going to trigger
something else as well.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.730
I'm going to make the
colors change.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.050
So let's do that.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:04.690
There we go.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.920
So now it's going to change from
green to yellow just by

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.220
changing a class name.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:09.260
And that's great.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.510
It's not awfully fast,
but it's consistent.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:17.090
What I'm going to do now is take
one of these boxes, and

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.505
I'm going to do the same
hack we did before.

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:20.250
It's really annoying because the
class names are changing.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.410
I can't quite get
a hold of it.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:23.160
OK.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.560
OK.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.950
I'm just going to press here.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:26.490
Oh, don't do this to me.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.740
There we go.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:29.770
It's good.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.400
It's fine.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.080
So I'm going to do the same
hack again, translate

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.000
Z and down to 0.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.530
And now if we look at the phone,
the performance is

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:42.620
roughly the same as
it was before.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.250
But you can see as it changes
color there's a--

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.240
we call it jank, right?--

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:48.580
a jank.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.650
PAUL KINLAN: I used
to call it yank.

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.230
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's a yank.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.380
That's racist, man.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.870
Don't.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:52.770
PAUL KINLAN: It's not.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:53.460
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You're
getting fired.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.540
I'm still employed.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.910
PAUL KINLAN: Well, I thought it
was like in a lot of places

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.960
in Europe they pronounce
the j's y's.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.870
All right.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:04.780
I'm going to move on.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.950
If we have a look in timeline in
devtools in the desktop, we

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.140
can see that jank happening
right there.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.680
And we can see what the
result of that is

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.620
is all these paints.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.140
And as I was saying before,
because we're actually

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.490
changing the appearance of the
element, it's having to go

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:23.440
away and paint every one of
those squares individually and

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.450
upload them to the GPU.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.210
And that's really cheap on your
desktop, but it's really

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.910
expensive on a mobile.

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.770
The Nexus 7 we're demoing on has
quite a good relationship

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.510
with the GPU, whereas
phones often don't.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.390
And you can run into
real trouble.

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.655
What I'm trying to say is
translate Z is like beer.

00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:45.510
It's like having a
bottle of beer.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.385
I don't know about you, but
there are some things I am

00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:50.360
better at after a bottle
of beer, things like--

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.350
PAUL KINLAN: Darts.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --talking
to people.

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:52.880
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.480
Dancing.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Dancing, yeah.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.280
Yeah.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.385
But after a few more beers,
I am worse at

00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:02.230
them than to start.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.450
I am lying on the floor telling
a fire extinguisher

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.210
how pretty its hair is, or
something like that.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.690
And this is how it works.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.320
So your desktop can really
hold its liquor.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.010
It's good at it.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.880
It's being optimized
to do that.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.370
Whereas your phone
is a lightweight.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.670
After a couple of beers, it's
going to start throwing up.

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.130
And it's going to be throwing
up GPU memory.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.020
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.900
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
could demo that.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.520
Or we're out of time?

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:29.430
PAUL KINLAN: I think
we're out of time.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.320
I think what we should do,
though, is we've got a lot of

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.240
questions in the Moderator--

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.760
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh,
that's good.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.160
PAUL KINLAN: --some of which
I know we can demo.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.830
And we can be a little
bit quicker.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:39.240
I know there's no one in this
studio after us, so I think we

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.850
should be OK.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.430
And if we're not, my colleagues
will ping me and

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.420
tell us to get off air.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah,
that's good.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.125
They'll be knocking
at the door.

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:45.390
That's fine.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:47.300
PAUL KINLAN: Well, they'll
be in America somewhere.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:47.615
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh.

00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:48.818
Oh, OK.

00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:49.706
How can they use--?

00:32:49.706 --> 00:32:49.817
OK.

00:32:49.817 --> 00:32:50.150
It doesn't matter.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:50.670
PAUL KINLAN: It doesn't
matter.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.150
It's the internet.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:52.405
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Wow.

00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:53.620
PAUL KINLAN: This cloud
thing, right?

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.770
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, is
that our new product?

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.470
A transporter?

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.430
Is that launching at I/O?

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.040
PAUL KINLAN: I did actually say
they'll ping me, not knock

00:32:59.040 --> 00:32:59.460
on the door.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.050
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, OK.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.520
PAUL KINLAN: Anyway,
we're wasting time.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Carry on.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.330
PAUL KINLAN: So first and
most popular question,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.960
from Mark J in London.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.875
I don't quite know
Mark J. Do you?

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:09.370
JAKE ARCHIBALD: No.

00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:10.270
PAUL KINLAN: Well,
hello, Mark J.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.556
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Sorry
if I do know you.

00:33:12.556 --> 00:33:13.270
PAUL KINLAN: I'm sorry too.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Has
he put his age?

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.860
People should put their
age with questions.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:17.560
I like it.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:17.900
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.480
He's 28, from London.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Excellent.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.670
PAUL KINLAN: Will fixed position
always be such a huge

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.210
performance killer?

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.180
So I know you've done a little
bit of research about this

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.200
just today.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.830
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.680
No, it won't.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.260
In fact, let's have a look.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:35.350
If we go onto the mobile
device, I'm going

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:39.790
to launch BBC News.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.590
And there we go.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.325
OK.

00:33:41.325 --> 00:33:42.570
Oh, what's Cameron doing?

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.960
Anyway, let's have a look
at devtools as well.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:52.200
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to click on this,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.680
and I'm going to get hold
of this masthead here.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.580
There we go.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.345
And what I'm going to
do is I'm going to

00:33:57.345 --> 00:33:58.310
make this fixed position.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:08.280
So fixed and top 0, left 0.

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.510
Let's give it width 100%,
because it's not in flow

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.690
anymore, and Z index--

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.980
What's your favorite
number, Paul?

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.659
PAUL KINLAN: 74.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.800
JAKE ARCHIBALD: 74.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.832
PAUL KINLAN: Just ignore
me and put 64 instead.

00:34:20.832 --> 00:34:23.825
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I hate your
favorite number, so I'm not

00:34:23.825 --> 00:34:24.300
going to do it.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.530
So if we have a look at the
mobile device now, I fixed

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:28.679
that masthead at the top.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.290
And really we don't
have too much of a

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.960
performance problem at all.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.600
One thing to watch
out for is if--

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:34.810
OK.

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.650
The BBC doesn't do
pinch zooming.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.440
In fact, I'm going to make it
do pinch zooming, because

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.780
we've got devtools.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.880
PAUL KINLAN: Does this work if
you modify the viewport?

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.100
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Let's
find out.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:45.639
This is exciting.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:48.590
There it is, user-scalable 1.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.000
I don't know what that means.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.260
That doesn't mean anything.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:55.080
Maximum scale of 1, that's
our problem.

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:55.420
Right.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:57.440
Let's see if that worked.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.400
Oh, look at it go.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.070
Excellent.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:03.360
So yeah, using fixed
elements--

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.290
Oh, I've clicked on
the link now.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:07.240
No, no, I haven't.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.750
With pinch zooming, you get a
really behavior with fixed

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.260
positioning.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.146
But without it, is it's actually
decently fast.

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:18.100
Yeah, scrolling is
going smoothly.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.280
I think this is a problem
on all the devices.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.930
I think that's what we're
talking about.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:22.080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.360
JAKE ARCHIBALD: In fact, it's
more of a problem on desktop.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.970
PAUL KINLAN: We actually had a
problem the other week where

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.530
we were debugging another app
and fixed position actually

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.570
caused a different behavior.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.770
I don't know whether
it was a slow path.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:33.900
Well, it probably was
a slow path, because

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.090
it was a lot slower.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:36.965
Yeah, it was kind
of interesting.

00:35:36.965 --> 00:35:38.367
It caused a whole lot
of repaints that

00:35:38.367 --> 00:35:39.110
didn't need to happen.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:39.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:44.080
At the moment we do a full page
repaint on scroll, which

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:45.990
we're working on fixing.

00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:48.580
Fixed elements will go into
their own GPU layer, which is

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.950
what's happening on
a mobile already.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:50.205
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:35:50.205 --> 00:35:52.490
So to answer the question, like
you said before, it's not

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.600
always going to be a
performance killer.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.010
We know it is.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.680
And this is the great thing
about open source projects,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.020
like Firefox and Chrome and
others as well is that there

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.160
are normally open
bug trackers.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.300
Either submit one.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.510
If it's already submitted by
someone else, it'll be triaged

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.670
and merged in with
another issue, so

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.060
don't worry about that.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.330
But submit the feedback.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.100
And then that's when we know
fixed position is a critical

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:14.705
problem for developers.

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.040
PAUL KINLAN: So yeah, if it
is a problem, let us know.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.080
And the bug trackers are
normally the best way.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:21.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:22.730
And have a look at the timeline,
because that will

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:26.180
show you that large repaints
are happening.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.180
And any information you
can provider is great.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.810
We'll look into it as well, but
you might be able to find

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:34.070
out that the cause of your
problem is something you can

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:34.710
easily fix.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.480
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.930
Next question.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.210
It's [INAUDIBLE] in England.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.200
Is there a plan for Chrome to
integrate a view which shows

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.390
HTML5 exactly how it's processed
on the mobile?

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.470
OK.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.610
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
was just words.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.230
PAUL KINLAN: That was me
not reading properly.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, OK.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.380
Sorry there.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.540
PAUL KINLAN: In iOS,
there's a simulator

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.450
which emulates Safari.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.510
It has those differences.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:57.135
And then the same with
Android emulators.

00:36:57.135 --> 00:37:00.530
So this is actually one
of those things that--

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.070
Email me, paulkinlan@google.com,
because

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.430
I want to find out how people
work on desktop.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:07.370
Because right now we're finding
that it's not too hard

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.150
to connect to a device and
actually do the testing.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.170
But at the same time, we
understand the fact that if

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.530
you're on a desktop machine--

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:15.140
Can you actually show up a page
that we can go to to show

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.570
one of the little things
that we can do?

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.260
JAKE ARCHIBALD: On what?

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.180
What do you mean?

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.230
PAUL KINLAN: On the desktop.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.190
JAKE ARCHIBALD: On the desktop,
what do you want?

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.700
PAUL KINLAN: Devtools.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.450
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I phased out.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.050
Devtools.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.290
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, on
desktop devtools.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:24.420
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK, OK, OK.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.120
PAUL KINLAN: Come on.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:26.630
Just anywhere.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.940
It's fine.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.180
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But I
want to say this--

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.200
I can't even spell.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.995
PAUL KINLAN: It's OK.

00:37:31.995 --> 00:37:32.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:32.930
There you go.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:33.380
Desktop.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:33.810
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:38.660
Now go to Settings, and
then Overrides.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.470
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Overrides.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.760
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.400
We can get to User Agent
and Device Metrics.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:42.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.880
PAUL KINLAN: So we can
do some things.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.235
Obviously Jake's not clicking
the buttons I

00:37:46.235 --> 00:37:46.770
asked him to click.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:49.540
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, you didn't
say click the buttons.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.240
PAUL KINLAN: I thought you
would have been able to

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:50.790
understand my--

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.650
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I thought
you were just--

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:52.140
PAUL KINLAN: --motioning.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.820
JAKE ARCHIBALD: --trying
to impress

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.720
people with your reading.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.990
PAUL KINLAN: Well, obviously
not, because they can't see

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.280
what I'm pointing at on the
screen properly, can they?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:56.550
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, OK.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.130
Sorry.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.575
PAUL KINLAN: I haven't
got Google Glass.

00:37:58.575 --> 00:37:59.940
If I had Google Glass
it'd be awesome.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.950
But essentially what we see is
that we can make the device

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.330
metrics to be like a Chrome for
mobile, Chrome for Android

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.680
iOS, so you can test it.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.810
However, it doesn't emulate the
viewport, and it doesn't

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.500
emulate a whole lot of other
things that you'd expect on

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.510
the machine.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.340
And if you talk to the
performance guys, they

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.620
actually want you to test--

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.100
that was quick--

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.030
on the devices, because when
you're thinking about

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.590
performance, a lot of the time
it's the GPU characteristics

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.050
and a whole lot of other
stuff which might

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:22.850
be causing you problems.

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.130
You might think you've done it
quite well on one machine.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.570
You go to your device,
and it's a

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.280
completely different profile.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.780
So that's why we're encouraging
people to use the

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.890
devtools and actually test on
the devices themselves.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:35.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: As you say, the
emulators we have, because

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:39.110
they're actual emulators, they
will accurately show you the

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:40.890
rendering, but they won't
accurately show you the

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:41.760
performance.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.540
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:45.290
JAKE ARCHIBALD: iOS, the dev
simulator is a simulator.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.400
It's using the underlying
rendering in Mac OS.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.500
So your rendering might be
slightly different, and your

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.530
performance will be the
performance of your desktop

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:54.990
machine rather than
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.290
in mobile.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:56.890
So you need to test them.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.880
And neither of them give you
the same kind of touch

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.670
experience that using an
actual device will.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.090
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.200
We'll do a couple more.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.930
We'll try and get through
a couple more.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.320
A while ago there was a
discussion about the best

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.860
approaches for responsive
images, the best way

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:11.870
to defer load in.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.670
Is there a de facto standard
yet, in your opinion?

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.340
I No.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:15.540
There's no de facto standard.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:15.970
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Nah.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.410
PAUL KINLAN: We showed you
in the BBC before.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.420
They do an image replacement
technique with some

00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.380
JavaScript.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.560
If you actually use the devtools
and go in and inspect

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.770
what they do, it's actually
pretty cool.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.065
They work out the viewport size
or the image size and

00:39:27.065 --> 00:39:29.030
then work out which ones are
the best ones to display.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.350
JAKE ARCHIBALD: There's
matchMedia.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:35.340
matchMedia will let you do
a CSS media query test in

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:35.920
JavaScript.

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.520
And that's really
useful for that.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:38.670
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:41.390
There's a webkit image set
tag which you can use.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.250
And we've got a little hack,
which we'll share later on.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.220
I actually did it on Twitter
the other day where you can

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:50.820
display a two times pixel ratio
image and all those

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.790
types of things.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.360
But it's only responsive to
pixel density and not any

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.620
other context.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.750
So there is none, and there's
no implementations, and

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.230
there's no implementations
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.180
yet, which I believe is
the other one as well.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.465
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:05.620
If you're using CSS backgrounds,
then you can

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.950
obviously just use
media queries.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.880
And there's also one for
device-pixel ratio.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.000
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.120
But the problem with
backgrounds, is if you do an

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.330
image, for instance, like the
alt tag comes through still

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.390
with a lot of other stuff.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.790
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.020
PAUL KINLAN: So it's a pain.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.101
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:40:17.101 --> 00:40:20.820
I wouldn't recommend using CSS
for content images just

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.400
because it's more convenient
to switch them

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.070
at different widths.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:24.820
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.660
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Look at what
the BBC have done.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.990
PAUL KINLAN: It looks nice.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.550
It looks like the old gifs--

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.190
Or gifs?

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.730
I don't know.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:30.990
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Gifs.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.760
Definitely gifs.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.390
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, gif.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:35.030
But it's gifs in "Doom,"
not gif.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.630
Anyway, next question.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.670
I use Adobe Edge and weinre to
inspect mobile devices, which

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.450
I'm finding useful.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:44.220
Is it possible to do something
similar in devtools?

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:44.900
Yes.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.040
We've just shown you.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:47.700
That's the next one.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.190
Currently building an entire
JavaScript app for mobile.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.035
Is mobile generally up to the
process in rendering?

00:40:52.035 --> 00:40:53.930
And how can I optimize
for mobile?

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.820
From Simon Smith in London.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.075
And I guess his age is 26.

00:40:58.075 --> 00:40:58.910
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Oh, 26.

00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:59.300
PAUL KINLAN: 34?

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.080
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
younger than me.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.490
Well done.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.030
PAUL KINLAN: Anyway.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:07.110
So I think it all depends on the
operations that you do and

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.240
you need to test.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.920
We find that things like
box-shadow that you showed

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:13.640
before and a whole lot of other
stuff can cause issues.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.875
Box-shadow and border-radius
and a couple of other ones.

00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:16.140
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.240
PAUL KINLAN: And it changes,
because as the browsers update

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.850
the performance profiles
change as well.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.270
So you're going to have to keep
testing a little bit.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.370
Process and rendering, yeah,
they're actually pretty good.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.650
If you do it right,
it's pretty good.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:27.675
But you've got to test,
and you've got

00:41:27.675 --> 00:41:28.590
to test on the devices.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.320
I don't think there's any real
way of getting around it,

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:32.580
because devices are different.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.900
Desktops are different.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.670
Tablets are different.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:36.845
Everything's different.

00:41:36.845 --> 00:41:37.160
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.800
JavaScript's not your problem,
really, anymore.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.140
And we heard [INAUDIBLE]
guys are

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.360
saying that it's rendering.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.560
Because the JavaScript engines,
even on a mobile

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.230
device, are pretty fast,
unless you're doing ray

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.220
tracing or trying
to do something

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.750
like gzip on the clients.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:54.940
Yeah, you're going to run
into problems there.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.700
But for general website use,
JavaScript's not you problem.

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.770
You might run into rendering,
but devtools will tell you

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:01.960
where the rendering
problems are.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.970
Even something like a
box-shadow, once you've drawn

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.490
it, as long as you're not
changing the shape and size of

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.542
it, it draws once and it
stays in memory so

00:42:09.542 --> 00:42:10.842
it's less smooth scrolling.

00:42:10.842 --> 00:42:11.500
PAUL KINLAN: I don't know.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:16.050
I've seen HTML5 Rocks go slow
because of the scrolling.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:16.610
I don't know.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.060
It's horses for courses
sometimes.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:18.446
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:42:18.446 --> 00:42:21.350
PAUL KINLAN: And it depends.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.040
Next question, [INAUDIBLE]
in Chile.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.450
Any link for more resources
about mobile

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.330
dev with Chrome devtools?

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.480
We haven't got anything
dedicated.

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:35.945
We've got developers.googl
e.com/chrome/mobile.

00:42:35.945 --> 00:42:38.920
It is literally just the
devtools, so anything that you

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:39.980
do with devtools.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.060
We should probably get some
performance articles written

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.125
about how to actually do better
mobile debugging and

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:44.810
everything.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.510
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And so have a
look on YouTube for talks by

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.070
there's a new young developer
called Paul Irish.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.020
And he's done quite a few
interesting talks about this

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.560
stuff, hasn't he?

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:52.836
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:53.700
And [INAUDIBLE] has as well.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.650
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.740
PAUL KINLAN: So if you
ever see [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.000
ask him to do his Paul
Irish impression.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:57.760
It's brilliant.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.480
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Very,
very good.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.380
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:01.510
Right.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.450
I want to get one more in.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.300
Patrick H. Lauke.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I
know Patrick.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:07.580
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.190
And he actually sent
a tweet in before.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Did he?

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:10.390
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:12.560
I'm About the other TV presenter
you look like.

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.570
And it was rather amusing.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:14.700
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yes.

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.670
PAUL KINLAN: So let's
look at this one.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.310
With mobile devices often having
limited memory, care to

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.040
comment about not just
compressing and minimizing

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:23.810
files over the AIR gzip but
actually caring about the

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.190
deflated file size?

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.530
So this for processing
it actually onto

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:29.450
the device in memory.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.050
Can I start with that one?

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.110
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Whatever,
mate.

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:33.980
Yeah, go on.

00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.720
PAUL KINLAN: Whatever.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:42.470
So we've seen this with devices
with different pixel

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.080
ratios where a pixel isn't
a pixel anymore.

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.700
We've seen that image decode
and resize happens

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.050
when you have to--

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.750
The image decode always happens,
so the bigger the

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.800
image the longer it
takes to decode.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.430
And if it takes it a long time
on a desktop machine to

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.510
decode, it's going to take even
longer on a phone or a

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.070
tablet to decode.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.380
But we've also seen resizes
happen where if it's not done

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:08.220
at the same DPI, essentially,
as the target device then it

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.410
has to do a resize.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.640
So if it knows it's 500 pixels,
it has to actually

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.375
double it to 1,000 pixels, in
theory, behind the scenes.

00:44:14.375 --> 00:44:16.600
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But with all
the different DPIs that we

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.300
have on devices now,
it's truly nearly

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.745
impossible to avoid.

00:44:20.745 --> 00:44:24.410
PAUL KINLAN: Well, you could
have a 1.33333337.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:26.040
JAKE ARCHIBALD: You could
generate them on the server, I

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.960
guess, if it was a problem
on a particular--

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.370
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.740
I know Page Speed tries to do
things like this, the Page

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.740
Speed services and everything.

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:35.110
They try and optimize the size
for the container and a whole

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:35.780
load of other stuff--

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:36.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That
makes sense.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.060
PAUL KINLAN: --and the
device format.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.140
But it's hard man, especially
when you're on the other side

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.890
of the server where you don't
quite know the device

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.530
characteristics unless you've
got them in a big database.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:47.350
So how would you
deal with that?

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.920
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think it's
down to the browser

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.900
developers.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.620
It's not our problem.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.930
Go and fix image resizing.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.480
I know they're looking at it.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.490
And it's something that
will get a lot better.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:58.880
PAUL KINLAN: I think that's
actually one thing that we

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:02.400
haven't really touched upon
is the time to decode CSS

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.885
JavaScript in its raw form.

00:45:04.885 --> 00:45:06.500
JAKE ARCHIBALD: So the BBC do
something very interesting,

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.750
and it's kind of similar
to something I did

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:09.790
when I was at Lanyrd.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.260
We do a basic feature detect
in the head of the page and

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:18.165
for what we think the site needs
to run the JavaScript

00:45:18.165 --> 00:45:18.660
we're running.

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:21.390
So I think for me it was
AppCache and local storage.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.130
For the BBC, I think they look
at JSON and some other stuff.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.750
And if the browser fails those
tests, don't load any

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.035
JavaScript.

00:45:27.035 --> 00:45:27.730
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: And because
the site works without

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.680
JavaScript--

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.538
The browsers that are going to
fail, though, are going to be

00:45:32.538 --> 00:45:33.350
old browsers.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:35.460
Those old browsers are going
to be slow at pausing

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.580
JavaScript.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.300
We saw on old BlackBerrys--

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.750
and we weren't running
any scripts, we were

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:41.700
just pausing it--

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.620
was causing like a 5 to
10 second delay on

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.750
just loading a page.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.240
And caching doesn't
help with that.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.180
That's going to hit
every single page.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.600
So yeah, if you can
conditionally load JavaScript

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.200
or conditionally load content
as well, that

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.152
works really well.

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.390
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.590
JAKE ARCHIBALD: But what I would
say don't do is don't

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.470
lazyload content on a
mobile device unless

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.970
it is a huge chunk.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.660
Because if you're scrolling down
a page and you're loading

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.825
in imagery as it appears, that's
quite good on desktops.

00:46:08.825 --> 00:46:11.590
But on mobile, if you're
on cellular data--

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:12.680
I guess the same would
apply for a

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.650
desktop on cellular data--

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.130
the cell falls asleep.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.000
The radio falls asleep.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.280
PAUL KINLAN: I'm falling
asleep right now.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.270
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.210
I'm boring myself, actually.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.110
The cell falls asleep, the radio
falls asleep, and then a

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:28.927
new thing goes to load.

00:46:28.927 --> 00:46:30.510
It has to be woken up.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.030
And before it wakes up, it wants
its breakfast, and its

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:35.650
breakfast is your
battery life.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.050
So it does all that, and then
it'll go and download stuff.

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.970
So lazyloading can seem like,
yeah, this is going to

00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:41.590
speed things up.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.540
Just load stuff when
it's necessary.

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.570
On cell data, on mobile
3G, whatever--

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.890
PAUL KINLAN: But if you lazyload
at the start of the

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.370
page, it's not going to make
that much difference, right?

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.200
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Start
of the page is fine.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.530
As long as it's roughly
the same time--

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:54.910
PAUL KINLAN: So what you're
saying, though, is anything

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.390
with Ajax-based refresh is
going to be potentially a

00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:59.952
performance killer or
a battery killer.

00:46:59.952 --> 00:47:00.279
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:47:00.279 --> 00:47:02.290
And if you can get away with
sending it all down the wire

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.670
to start and it's not too much,
then I would do that.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.370
PAUL KINLAN: It would be
interesting to know well

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:09.050
service and events
work and whether

00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:10.550
they keep the battery--

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:11.376
I don't know.

00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:12.770
It'd be interesting.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:15.660
So actually, that's a
good time to finish.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.070
JAKE ARCHIBALD: OK.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:17.420
PAUL KINLAN: I think.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.370
You just yammered on like
crazy for ages, man.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.880
It was terrible.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.310
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm
going to the pub.

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.010
PAUL KINLAN: So what we're doing
is a series of podcasts.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.100
We're going to have a cycle.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.610
So the next performance
one is going to be

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.700
in a couple of weeks.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.730
I know Jake's got a
lot more content.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:34.740
He prepared it a lot today,
and we ran over.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:35.340
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Join
us next time.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:35.670
PAUL KINLAN: So we're definitely
going to do another

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.290
performance one.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:39.040
We'd like to hear from you to
understand what kind of things

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.680
you want to hear us talk about
around, I suppose, the client

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:44.010
side of the performance.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:46.100
[INAUDIBLE] is going to talk
about networking and network

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.580
performance, and we don't want
to go over that too much.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.690
But building performance user
experiences and user

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.460
interfaces, we want to know what
you want to hear about,

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.670
the problems that you're having,
so that we can address

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.650
them in articles and also in
videos and programs like this.

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:05.900
I think next week is Sam, our
producer, who's actually been

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.320
switching all the buttons
for us today and

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.210
helping us out loads.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.920
What are we talking about
next week, Sam?

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.510
Devtools?

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.840
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.630
That'll do.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:13.780
PAUL KINLAN: Devtools or OWP.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.870
We'll send out a
tweet later on.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.540
But it's going to be good, and
we'll ask you for questions

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.740
that you want answered
live as well.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.320
And then we'll do this
one again in a

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.340
couple of weeks' time.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's Sam's first
time producing as well

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.530
on one of these things.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:26.500
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:27.680
JAKE ARCHIBALD: It's
his first time.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.130
It's my first time.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.530
PAUL KINLAN: You
are producing--

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.000
JAKE ARCHIBALD: That's
pretty romantic.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.570
PAUL KINLAN: --next week.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.482
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I'm not
producing next week.

00:48:31.482 --> 00:48:32.140
PAUL KINLAN: You are.

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:32.910
SAM DUTTON: Oh, yes, you are.

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:34.410
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.050
Next week, if you see it just
changed to a picture of, I

00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.474
don't know, whatever,
that's Jake.

00:48:39.474 --> 00:48:40.710
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:41.210
So

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.540
PAUL KINLAN: Anyway, with that,
I think we're finished.

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:45.610
And we would like
to say goodbye.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.690
Well, I would like
to say goodbye.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.970
What would you like to say?

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:48.740
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Hello.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:49.520
How's it going?

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.970
Do you want to go for a drink?

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:51.890
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:54.860
JAKE ARCHIBALD: I think you've
got a great sense of humor.

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:55.080
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.380
With that, then we'll
see you soon.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.280
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Thank
you very much.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:58.810
PAUL KINLAN: Bye bye.

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.060
JAKE ARCHIBALD: Bye bye.
