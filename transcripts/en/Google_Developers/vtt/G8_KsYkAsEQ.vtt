00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.580
DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge,
and this is "Google Root

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.710
Access." Today we're going to
talk about open source--

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.200
how Google uses open source, and
how Google contributes to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.360
open source.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.370
My guest today is Chris DiBona,
who runs the Open

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.080
Source Projects for Google.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.790
Welcome, Chris.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.636
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks, Don.

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:34.710
DON DODGE: So tell me, what
do you do at Google?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.770
CHRIS DIBONA: So very basically,
if there's open

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.560
source at Google it's my
job and my team's job

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.130
to look after it.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.370
And that includes all the code
we might use when creating

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.500
sites like google.com, and
Gmail, and all the docs and

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.070
spreadsheets and apps
that we have online.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.580
But also all the things
that we ship--

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.530
things like Android
and Chrome.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.465
And if you have a Nexus device,
or if you're one of

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:04.440
the people who is a Google Glass
beta tester, you'll be

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.250
running open source
code on there.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.300
Whether as part of the
proprietary software running

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.720
on top of it, or as a whole
open source ecosystem like

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.000
Android and Chrome.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.405
So we make sure that we ship
things within compliance of

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:24.490
those licenses, but also so that
those teams have correct

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.680
infrastructure as well.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.570
So we look after all kinds of
infrastructure for Android and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870
some of the other
teams right now.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.010
DON DODGE: So some people may
not know this, but Google's

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.630
roots are actually
in open source.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.220
Google built its own servers
and used Linux, and hacked

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.080
Linux to do very interesting
things.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.380
Can you tell us a little
about that?

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.610
CHRIS DIBONA: Sure.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.150
Well, actually, if you look back
to when Larry and Sergey

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.040
were at Stanford and building
BackRub, which of course

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.980
became Google.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.385
That was all written in Python
and using some fairly standard

00:01:57.385 --> 00:02:00.200
web serving tools and libraries,
and they put the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.520
uniqueness that was
Google on that.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.680
So you had Python running on top
of Linux, running on top

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.000
of all kinds and all
manner of hardware.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.710
And as we grew up as a company,
we kept that ethos

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.450
where we would get what a lot
of people would consider

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.140
fairly trashy hardware, and we
would get our reliability from

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.380
the software layer.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.560
And that was Linux, and that
was Python, and that was

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.770
eventually Java and
C and the rest.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.520
And so we started with open
source in a lot of ways and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.310
built on top of it, and it's
been a pretty healthy code

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.815
system since then.

00:02:40.815 --> 00:02:45.560
DON DODGE: So Google not only
uses open source and used it

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.150
to build the base of Google, the
infrastructure of Google,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.620
but Google also contributes
to open source?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.590
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, to date
we've conservatively estimated

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.010
that we've contributed from
Google Developers about 50

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.780
million lines of code,
give or take.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.490
And that spans everything from
Android and Chromium, all the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.250
way through to compilers.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.710
For instance, if you have any
consumer electronics device

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.530
that's been made in the last
five years, you're probably

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.240
running some Google code on it
and you don't even know it,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.250
through the libraries that we've
contributed to and just

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.890
the vast number of projects
we've released,

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.830
so it's fairly shocking.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.180
And this is not even taking
into account the vast

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.022
proliferation of Android, and
the technology inside Android.

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:33.710
DON DODGE: So the infrastructure
things--

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.040
BigTable and Hadoop.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.370
Tell us a little bit about how
that evolved and what are some

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.000
of those open source projects
that either came out of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.220
BigTable in Google's
infrastructure, or were

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.130
modeled after that.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.000
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so if you
look at Hadoop, we published a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.950
paper back in 2000, I want to
say 2002 or 2003, about the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.210
Google File System which
is called GFS.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.520
And it inspired folks like Doug
Cutting to go out and

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.620
write open source
implementations of this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.600
technology.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.880
And that happens with a lot
of the things that we do

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.840
publications about, but
don't actually ship

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.900
as open source software.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.519
So what you see coming from
Google is often, if we talk

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.130
about it, people will want it.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.839
And if we don't release it
as open source, they'll

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.550
try to create it.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.480
That's actually really
healthy.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.110
And so you've seen a
proliferation of these kinds

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.650
of big data tools like MongoDB
and Redis and LevelDB and all

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.550
these really interesting
large-scale key

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.950
value stores and stuff.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.130
And they have their roots in us
publishing papers about our

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.940
internal systems like BigTable
and NGFS and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.290
Spanner and the rest.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.550
DON DODGE: You mentioned
Chromium, Android, and some

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.150
other pretty major open source
products that Google has.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.040
Are they licensed the same and
they are basically the same?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.480
Or are they quite different
in how we handle them?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.980
CHRIS DIBONA: So Chromium
and Android are

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.240
actually quite different.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.040
If you look at Chromium, when
we wrote it we really wanted

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.660
to inspire other browser
manufacturers to, frankly, do

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.770
what we do.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.180
And so we wanted to make it
possible for them to actually

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.370
use our code.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.360
So beyond just contributing
to WebKit, we also made a

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.290
conscious decision to license
Chromium under BSD.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.570
Because that code would then
be consumable by not just

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.210
WebKit-based browsers, but also
those of them that might

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.370
use Gecko, Mozilla.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.910
Even Microsoft could take that
code and pull it into their

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.390
browser or their software, and
not just learn, but actually

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.170
just use what we're
publishing.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.940
Because when we shipped
Chromium--

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.540
this is something a lot of
people don't understand-- when

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.150
we first shipped to Chrome and
Chromium, this was a time when

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.850
one tab getting slow would take
down your whole browser.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.900
And we weren't really taking
advantage of the full

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.760
capabilities of a modern
CPU or modern hardware.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.680
And so we really wanted to bring
that kind of processed

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.790
isolation, and also the security
in a sandbox to the

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.990
browser so that people could
feel the browser was a safe

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.040
place to work and to consume
information.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.980
So we tried to convince other
browser manufacturers that

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.640
this was really important.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.240
And we decided that it was time
to just do it, and do it

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.380
in such a way that they could,
if they ended up agreeing with

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.910
us later, just adopt the work.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.500
And we've been moderately
successful

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.810
with that later mission.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.970
But I think Chromium has been
very successful at showing

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.540
that you can take real advantage
of processed

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.610
isolation and sandboxing to
secure a web browser.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.010
And I think that's really
important, and people miss

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.720
that all the time.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.010
Now, Android's a different
story together.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.520
With Android, we licensed
Android under the Apache

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.580
license with the kernel being
the GPL Linux kernel.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.750
And we chose Apache for
a number of reasons.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.810
Apache has this really awesome
language around patents.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.750
So it says, hey, if you're using
our software and we have

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.350
patents that read on that
software, we're not going to

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.670
come and rent seek against
you for that software

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.110
unless you sue us.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.120
So if you sue us, we're going
to retain the rights to use

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.660
those patents in the defense
of our company against you.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.910
But otherwise, we're telling you
that you have nothing to

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.770
fear from Google and
from using Android.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.190
And that was a really big deal,
and I think it really

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.730
mattered with the carriers.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.750
Also, Apache has this unusual
aspect to it in the world of

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.530
open source where it says we
just want you to acknowledge

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.260
you're using it.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.800
We don't need you to share
your source code, too.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:43.070
And for the carriers who have
a lot of balls that they

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.830
juggle in the air at one time,
making compliance easier for

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.560
them is very important.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.540
And I think it has a lot to do
with why Android is as popular

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.620
as it is with so many
manufacturers, and you know

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.090
that it's a real open
source project.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.450
So companies will often
say hey, I've got

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.370
this open source thing.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.880
And then you'll see that they're
the only ones running

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.380
it, and the only ones who
will ever run it.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.470
And it comes down to trust,
and it comes down to what

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.070
license they use.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.320
I think it's extremely telling
that when you look at a

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:16.500
Kindle, or you look at a Nook,
or you look at half a dozen

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.660
Android-based devices
that don't have

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.010
anything to do with Google.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.390
That they continue to persistent
and exist, because

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.820
that's really open source.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.970
We can't stop them, and
nor do we want to.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.180
But even if we wanted to, we
couldn't stop them from using

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.110
the software.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.929
And that's how you know it's
really open source.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.730
DON DODGE: So I sort of
understand how open source

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.230
works and what it is.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.020
But I'm confused about this
jumble of licenses, there's an

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.630
alphabet soup of licenses.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.159
CHRIS DIBONA: You're
not alone.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.540
DON DODGE: Can you say a little
bit about what are the

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.130
major licenses and
differences?

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.430
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, there's
three major

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.960
categories of licenses.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.220
There's what we call the
permissive licenses, and they

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.170
basically say, here's some
code, Don, enjoy it.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.330
And all we really ask from you
is that you mark in your about

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.860
box or in your documentation
that you're using it.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.650
So those are the

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.460
permissive/notification licenses.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.610
DON DODGE: What are some
examples of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.700
CHRIS DIBONA: So that would be
BSD, that would be Apache,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.380
MIT, ones like that.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.810
And then there are the more
share alike style licenses.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.260
And they say if I give my
software to Don and Don ships

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.830
something, well, then
he's obligated to

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.680
share his code, too.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.450
For some definition of
share and use and all

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.210
the rest, of course.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.800
But those are your GPL licenses,
your LGPL licenses,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.560
and to a lesser degree the MPL
licenses as part of the

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.690
Mozilla tri-license.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.180
So depending on which one it is,
you'd either have to share

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.890
more or less code, depending on
how you use that software.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.730
And this stuff is deeply
confusing, so you shouldn't

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.450
feel like you're ignorant
of this stuff--

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.780
almost everyone is.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.320
And it's not just a jobs program
for me and people like

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.650
me, it's just complicated
stuff.

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:02.940
Because these licenses, they
say how people feel about

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.280
sharing their software.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.810
And when you talk about
feelings, things get confusing

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:09.450
and complicated.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:13.200
And then the third category of
licenses are the ones that are

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.550
trying to also define network
performance as being the kind

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:23.000
of sharing that invokes the
resharing of software.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.550
So there are very few of these,
and they're applied to

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.640
very few actual pieces
of software.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.470
But it's a version of
the GPL called the

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.620
Affero GPL, or the AGPL.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.680
And so, for instance, we don't
use any AGPL software at

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.120
Google and we don't
allow it here.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.980
And that would be like
MongoDB, and

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.910
RStudio and the rest.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.600
And so in those cases, we either
purchase a commercial

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.680
license from those software
companies or we simply don't

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.355
allow them.

00:10:48.355 --> 00:10:51.842
DON DODGE: So the AGPL, we
don't use that because--?

00:10:51.842 --> 00:10:56.530
CHRIS DIBONA: Because as it
interacts with other software

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.220
and then is displayed on, say,
a google.com site or on a

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.830
Gmail or apps site, we would
then have to share more

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.180
software than we're comfortable
sharing through

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.126
the linking to that software.

00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:13.590
DON DODGE: So if I'm a startup
and I'm building my company,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.750
what do I need to look out for
in terms of using open source?

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.386
And which license should I have,
and that kind of thing?

00:11:20.386 --> 00:11:23.420
CHRIS DIBONA: Well, except for
the AGPL, you pretty much

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.900
don't have anything to worry
about as, say, a web startup.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.230
If you're going to be shipping
software, that's a somewhat

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.660
longer conversation where you
try to suss out what the

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:34.490
startup wants to do, what
they're shipping, what they

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.760
want to share.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.820
Because open source is, in my
mind, also a fundamental part

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.325
of a developer relations
strategy

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.230
and a developer ecosystem.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.370
Without it you don't
have one, or it's a

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.820
very unfair one, frankly.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.280
So what I tell startups when I
advise them is that when you

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.430
bring software into the company
that isn't written by

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.250
someone at the company, and
that means anything--

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.880
examples, software from places
like GitHub, or Stack

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.230
Exchange, or Stack Overflow--

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.650
you should always put these in
a special directory, like a

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.710
third party directory.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.020
This is what we do at
Google, by the way.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.000
We have millions of
these directories

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.740
all over the place.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.910
Segregate the code--

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.230
you can absolutely,
unconditionally still use it,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.740
you just want to keep it
out in a special place.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.780
DON DODGE: In your code base
you actually segregate the

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.670
open source code and
you keep it there?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.230
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.760
And so you have these third
party directories and then you

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.560
call that code in whatever way
you see fit, but then at least

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.860
you know where it is.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.430
So there are other hygiene
things you can do, like make

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.020
sure you only have one version
of a specific library, even if

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.810
it's used across multiple
products.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.270
Keeping up to date with security
[INAUDIBLE], all

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.830
these things that are
fundamental to development.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.590
But keeping things separate
enough that you can keep on

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.900
identifying it is
pretty amazing.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.510
If you have that, you're
better than 90% of the

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.320
companies out there.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.730
DON DODGE: So that's
rule number one?

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.430
CHRIS DIBONA: That's
rule number one.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.390
You have to be careful
with the AGPL.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.950
So for instance, a lot of people
really like MongoDB

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.010
right now for what it does, and
that makes perfect sense.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.820
And if you look at how MongoDB
is licensed and the way they

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.930
articulate that license,
it's very clever.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:21.820
They have very smart client
licensing, which basically

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.720
doesn't transfer that network
obligation onto a website.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.190
But the database itself is
something you have to, if you

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.020
make improvements to the
database, if you have certain

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.830
code interacting with the
database in certain ways, that

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:36.820
code may end up being shared.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.620
So you'll just want to know that
when you're using tools

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.640
like MongoDB.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.970
Magento is another really
popular shopping cart

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.640
application.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.200
And it's not unfair to say
that this drives a lot of

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.540
license revenue to Magento and
MongoDB, and it's fair and

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.170
this is their deal.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.830
They're saying listen, we want
you to use this stuff.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.600
But if you use it in certain
ways, you should be paying us.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.460
And so that's a commercial
software license that you

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.220
would get from them.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.720
So that's the sort of thing we
see in acquisitions actually

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.970
quite a bit.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.980
DON DODGE: Good point.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.430
You also review acquisitions
for Google.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.500
Every time Google does an
acquisition, you look at the

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.970
code and look for open source,
make sure it's licensed.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.815
So say a little bit about what
you do in that process.

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:21.655
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, so for
instance, suppose you're a

00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:23.730
startup that does something
with video.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.380
You're probably using FFmpeg,
you're probably using it with

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.550
certain compile flags.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.480
And most people don't even
know this, by the way.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.950
At this point, by the time I
say compile flags, it means

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.490
there's a developer inside that
organization who built

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.880
that piece of software.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.060
And I can actually tell from
the output that I, the

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.400
consumer, can see pretty
much what you've done.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:44.760
So it's very easy for me to say,
OK, you're probably using

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.230
this, this, and this.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.830
And they're like, who told
you what we're using?

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.110
And it's like, we know.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.100
We've seen a million startups
like this, and so here's what

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.910
you'll have to do to be
compliant with these licenses.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.270
So we have that discussion a
lot with companies, by deal

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.800
close you have to
do X, Y, and Z.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.360
And it's funny, when I was
younger and maybe more

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.465
idealistic or less cynical, I
would say, I can't believe

00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:09.120
these people are breaking
licenses in such

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.160
a fundamental way.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.640
But what it is is most people's
intentions are pure.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.490
They just don't know how to be
compliant with these licenses,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.960
and sometimes it's actually
deeply complicated.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.225
So oftentimes when we see
acquisitions come in, we'll

00:15:21.225 --> 00:15:23.700
say, OK, if you want to keep
shipping this piece of

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.890
software, you have to do X and
Y and Z. And you've been

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.910
shipping this piece of software
for this long, so

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:29.920
you'll need to do this.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.470
So that people who want their
rights under the open source

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.670
licenses which you have chosen
to use are going to be able to

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.340
be satisfied.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.980
Because we like to in some
ways over-comply.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.680
Put up mirrors of code so
that people can find the

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.460
information they want about open
source in your product

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.640
simply by googling for it.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.210
It saves us a lot of time than
having to answer emails and

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.250
sit on mailing lists and worry
a lot about things.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.170
So we try to bring people into
our level of compliance, which

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.750
is very high, by the
time a deal closes.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.020
We've never had to scuttle a an

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.400
acquisition because of this.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.490
I've seen acquisitions fall
apart, and this might be a

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.630
component of that, but
it's very rare.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.260
It's more that bringing
discipline to your code base

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.760
for open source really has
higher implications about the

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.035
quality of the code
of the company.

00:16:24.035 --> 00:16:24.615
DON DODGE: Overall?

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:25.840
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.590
So it's extremely rare
to find somebody who

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.910
understands this stuff.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.160
What's the right way
to say this?

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.180
If someone has a good, tidy
code base, then they're

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.230
usually also either very
compliant with open source

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.940
licenses already, or easily
able to become compliant.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:48.120
If they're not compliant with
open source licenses and they

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.950
have an untidy code base, that
could have implications, too,

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.530
during an acquisition that have
nothing to do with the

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.260
open source license compliance
and everything to do with how

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.230
they develop and how they
bring software together.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.410
It's more of an indicator.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.814
DON DODGE: So if a startup is
using MongoDB, or Magento--

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:04.690
CHRIS DIBONA: Which a lot are.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.630
It's a great tool.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:06.460
They're both great tools.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.310
DON DODGE: So what
happens then?

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.700
We just don't consider using
that kind of software?

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.210
CHRIS DIBONA: In rare cases we
have a pool of licenses for

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:22.349
them to draw upon, but we
keep that very limited.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.650
Because usually when people come
to Google, they end up

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.890
transferring onto our technology
or we're shutting

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.140
their technology off.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.180
It depends on the situation.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.490
It's very hard to say we always
do X or we always do Y.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.130
Because we want to remain
flexible for

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.750
these kinds of things.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.660
There are some companies, and
I'm not going to name them,

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.490
where if you have GPL software
they will simply force you to

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.100
rip it out before they'll even
talk to you, much less let the

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.790
deal close.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:56.990
So it's rare nowadays, but
it certainly happens.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.240
And I'm not talking about
the Linux kernel.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.480
Everyone's comfortable with
the Linux kernel.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.140
It's sort of an accepted
thing that they have

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.010
to deal with that.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:11.260
But for some GPL tools and
system libraries and web

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.620
frameworks and stuff,
they don't want

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.340
to have that around.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.620
DON DODGE: Well, that's really
a competitive advantage for

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.955
Google and it has been
from the beginning.

00:18:18.955 --> 00:18:19.390
CHRIS DIBONA: I would
consider it so.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.710
Yeah.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.700
For instance, if you reject all
GPL and LGPL code, you're

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.490
rejecting 75% of the open source
code that's out there.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.390
And we're talking, I think it
was probably 35 million unique

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.090
files out there encompassing
maybe 5 billion lines of code.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.990
So you would be rejecting 75%
of that just by saying, I

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.110
don't want to deal with
the GPL and the LGPL.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:42.620
Again, it's a fine
decision to make.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.035
I think it's very limiting.

00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:47.360
DON DODGE: So Google roots are
in open source and we use open

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.940
source, we contribute
to open source.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.140
CHRIS DIBONA: We create new open
source developers with

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.060
the Summer of Code.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.330
I mean, we do a lot.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.010
DON DODGE: Say more about
the Summer of Code.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.710
You've been writing that program
for quite a while.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:58.420
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, we're
coming up on our

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.150
ninth year, I believe.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.860
And what that does is it
basically introduces students

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.030
to open source software.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.830
It sets up a one-to-one
mentoring relationship between

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.260
open source software projects
and students.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:16.390
So the idea was Larry Page was
uncomfortable that people were

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.330
leaving college for the summer
and then backsliding over the

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.850
summer because they had to
go get a job that wasn't

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.790
computer-related.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.950
So he was like, if you could fix
that, that would be great.

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:27.820
And I was like, OK.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.086
So we came up with the
Summer of Code as a

00:19:29.086 --> 00:19:29.570
way of fixing that.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.280
And the idea was we would give
people real world, real bug,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.310
real problem experience
in open source.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.220
And it would also expose them
to the world of open source

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.770
development.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.190
I think that's been
an incredible good

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.560
for computer science.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.540
We've only taken about
10,000 students

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.300
through the program now.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:46.830
DON DODGE: 10,000?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.910
That's a lot.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.680
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.590
10,000, 9,000, yeah,
about that.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.550
And we pay them over the
summer to do this work.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.660
DON DODGE: So they actually
get paid to do this?

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.820
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.454
We spend a fair amount
of money.

00:19:58.454 --> 00:20:04.100
And they on average write about
3,000 lines of code that

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.450
ends up into open
source software.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.905
So you can do the math
there, too--

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:08.400
it's a significant
amount of code.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.740
When you're a computer
science student--

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.310
I don't know if you went through
CS school-- but you're

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.980
taught a lot of theory and a lot
of comparative programing

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.880
languages and algorithms
and that kind of thing.

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.380
You're not taught what
happens when a

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.360
user uses your software.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.410
You're not taught what happens
when they decide to run it on

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.860
some horrible piece
of trash computer

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.870
that you never expected.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.250
And open source software
projects are exposed to that

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.010
kind of real world usage
all the time.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.760
And so you get a whole different
view into how to

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.970
make a software program work and
what users need by working

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:42.920
on open source.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.690
And additionally, this is not
a we bring them into Google

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.060
and host them kind of program.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.050
This is a wherever they are
all over the world.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.600
We've done this in
93 countries now.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.320
DON DODGE: Really?

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.880
CHRIS DIBONA: And paying
people in 93

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.210
countries is not easy.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.080
But we've had students in pretty
much any country you

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.830
can think of in the
modern world.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.640
Well, perhaps there's more
now that there's 273

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.970
countries in the UN.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:12.770
It's been pretty remarkable to
see how these students turn

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.880
from these neophyte programmers,
really, into

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.580
pretty amazing remote
programmers, which frankly is

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.790
something that industry
struggles with.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:25.210
Having remote developers is
extremely difficult, and open

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:26.520
source seems to figure it out.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.120
And what it comes down to,
really, is the people who are

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.170
good at that kind of thing are
good at open source, and the

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.010
people who aren't, aren't.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:38.315
So we had the failure mechanism
in the Summer of

00:21:38.315 --> 00:21:41.570
Code as well where we probably
fail about 14%, 15% of the

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.750
students every year out
of the program.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.530
And that means they
don't get paid at

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:47.580
some step of the program.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.210
So maybe they'll get the
acceptance fee, but not the

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.030
mid-term or the final payment.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.520
So it's very merit-based which
is also, I think, a key thing

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.430
about open source.

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.170
You either do a good job or
you're not part of it.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.080
DON DODGE: Fascinating.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:01.780
Well, thank you.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.160
Thank you for being here today
and for your contributions to

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.130
open source at Google.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.560
CHRIS DIBONA: Absolutely.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:06.980
DON DODGE: It's terrific.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.460
CHRIS DIBONA: Thanks
for having me.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.140
DON DODGE: Thank
you very much.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.230
Thank you for joining us.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.760
And be with us next time on
"Google Root Access," when

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.160
we'll be talking about how
startups can use open source.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.410
Thank you.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:42.453
