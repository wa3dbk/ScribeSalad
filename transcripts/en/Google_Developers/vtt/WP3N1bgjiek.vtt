Hi! I’m Alex, I’m a Software Engineer
here at Google and I work on Google Chrome

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.790
Frame -- a plug-in that’s bringing HTML5
and rich, modern web apps to IE 6, 7, and

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.810
8. We launched a developer preview of the
plug-in last Fall. Since then we’ve been

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.020
working hard to improve privacy, security,
and ease of deployment. We’ve also dramatically

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.570
improved the performance of the plug-in.
A stable version of Google Chrome Frame is

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.030
now available. Users of the beta will be automatically
updated to it and because Google Chrome Frame

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.199
is out of beta, you can now build rich apps
with HTML5’s audio, video, and canvas tags

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.649
without resorting to heavyweight shims and
frameworks that can slow down your site. New

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.270
features like CSS animations and SVG work
great in Google Chrome Frame, and I’m certain

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.949
that once you develop sites with modern web
technology, you’ll never want to go back.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.219
So how do you make your site work with Google
Chrome Frame?

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.710
Once installed, Google Chrome Frame inspects
pages served to IE, looking for a special

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.080
HTTP header or META tag.
Adding the meta tag to your site is simple,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.659
but remember that it should go at the very
top of your documents. If it’s too far down,

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.890
the plug-in might not see the tag.
The fastest and most reliable way to trigger

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.600
page rendering in Google Chrome Frame is by
using the HTTP header.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.930
Adding the header site-wide is often a simple
matter of including the right directives in

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.159
a template or in your web server configuration.
Here we’ll add a header in an Apache configuration,

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.880
restart the server, and see that when we visit
the site again we can right-click to use Chrome’s

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.789
Web &nbsp;Inspector... which is how we know the
page is being rendered with Google Chrome

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.210
Frame.
Scripts like CFInstall and Modernizr can help

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.100
you prompt users without the plug-in to upgrade
or install Google Chrome Frame. Prompting

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.289
users is totally optional though, and users
who don’t have the plug-in just get IE’s

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.539
existing behavior. &nbsp;Check out the documentation
at code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe for

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.619
details, but don’t worry, we’ve worked
to keep that part simple too.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.899
Thanks to HTML5, your rich apps can shine
without proprietary plug-ins and now, thanks

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.570
to Google Chrome Frame, you don’t even have
to leave users of legacy browsers behind.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.340
Thanks for listening and for adding the headers
to your next HTML5-powered project.
