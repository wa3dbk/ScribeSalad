00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.380
SAM: Without further
ado, I'd like to

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.190
introduce the first panel.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.640
Our moderator is James Pearce,
who does Dev Rel for Facebook.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.020
He tells me that he now spends
about half of his time doing

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.050
stuff on native.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.060
But his first love
is still the web.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.740
And so it's highly appropriate
that he's going to be taking

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.490
this really crucial session
about mobile performance.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.825
So take it away, James.

00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:31.080
Thank you.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.000
JAMES PEARCE: All right.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.230
Well, welcome everybody.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.840
As Sam said, this is the
performance panel.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
I was honored to be invited
to come and moderate it.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.540
I guess Facebook's recent
history with mobile and the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.205
web has been relatively
well documented.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
It's, as Michael said, the
Zuckerberg quote is "the gift

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.180
that keeps giving." But we
have obviously made a

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
commitment on our apps anyway,
on the Facebook apps, to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.330
producing the best possible
quality experience as we can.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.110
And we've ended up rewriting
both of our iOS and Android

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.210
apps to be pure native, where
they were previously hybrid

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.750
HTML5 in a wrapper
kind of apps.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.580
And if I summarize starkly the
decision we made there, it was

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.380
performance.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.160
There was only one reason
why we did that.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.710
We had to retrain literally
hundreds of developers.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.980
We had to retool our entire
build chain to produce iOS and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.670
Android apps where we'd
been previously

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.350
building a pure web stack.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.920
And pixel for pixel, the old
web app and the new native

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.030
apps were indistinguishable.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.370
Not anymore, but if you'd put
them side by at the time, it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.010
was very, very difficult to
tell which was which.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.090
And the only way you could tell
they were different was

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.530
the performance.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.060
And overnight, pretty much, our
ratings in the App Store

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.980
for the iOS app went from
two stars to four stars.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.400
And let me just say again, it
was nothing to do with the

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
pixels or the appearance or
the rendering or the drop

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.090
shadows or anything.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.130
It was purely the performance
and the increased user

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.520
experience of that.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.380
So it was because of mobile web
performance that we had to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.630
make this incredible
investment.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.740
And we really didn't want
to have to do that.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.270
So I'm here mostly to moderate
and channel your questions and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.470
channel the questions off
the moderator here.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.730
But also I'm going to say,
dude, where's my

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.940
60 frames per second?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.750
You honestly promised
us this years ago.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.760
The web was going to catch up.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.295
But we haven't got it.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:41.940
And businesses like ours and
businesses around the world

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.860
are still struggling
with this problem.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.800
So I have a panel here of four
distinguished experts, two

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.100
from the Chrome team and two
from external companies.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.300
I'd like them to introduce
themselves.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.280
We have Paul, Tom,
Ilya, and Ariya.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.160
A couple of minutes each if
you wold like, just to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.706
introduce yourselves, please.

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:02.140
PAUL BAKAUS: Hi, everybody.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.300
My name is Paul Bakaus.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.960
I am the W3C rep and
CTO for a studio

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.110
called Studio 5 at Zynga.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.955
And we're basically on a mission
to build what we think

00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.910
is the next generation
of social games.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.400
And we think HTML5 is the
right platform for that.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.700
We've been operating in stealth
mode for quite a bit,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.230
but now we're starting to roll
out our first experiments.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.570
And lots of them really involve
performance with terms

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.460
like instant play.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.880
We want to make people play
the games instantly.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.740
And that's where we think HTML5
comes really into play.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.380
All right, that's me.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.510
TOM WILTZIUS: Hi, I'm
Tom Wiltzius.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.310
I'm a product manager on the
Chrome team, working across

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.500
graphics projects including
Canvas, WebGL, but also core

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.280
rendering performance.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.520
So I am on the other side
of all of this.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.440
ILYA GRIGORIK: Hi, everyone.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.300
My name is Ilya.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.620
So I'm a developer advocate on
Make the Web Fast and Google

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.480
Chrome teams.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.900
And my focus has primarily been
on the network side-- so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.580
specifically for mobile
performance latency, how do we

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.320
accelerate that?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.910
So HTTP 2.0, SPDY, and just
trying to figure out what we

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.750
can do to move the web forward
and to enable richer apps that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.610
are still efficient when
delivered over the web.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.350
ARIYA HIDAYAT: Hi, everyone.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.960
My name is Ariya.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.420
I work for Sencha.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.630
We produce frameworks, tools,
and cloud surfaces for web

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.710
application, both desktop
and mobile.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.400
I have a general interest
in web technologies.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.090
I have been mainly the native
guy for a very long time.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.660
I worked on WebKit when
I was with Nokia.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.410
And then two years ago, 2 and
1/2 years ago, I decided to

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.000
switch sides and try to find out
how painful or comfortable

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.980
it is working with front-end
development.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.520
JAMES PEARCE: So now that you
know who everybody is, that's

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.530
a great opportunity for you to
think of the hardest question

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.350
you would like to ask
each of them.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.030
And hopefully you all have the
moderator page up, so you can

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.030
ask them there or simply
raise your hand.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.440
But to get started with, well,
I was thinking about this.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.670
Mobile performance, there's no
one thing that contributes to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.360
performance.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.600
It's a blend of lots of
different disciplines.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.320
And we expect developers to be
masters of all of them in

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.770
order to produce highly
performant apps.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.930
Sometimes it's going to be the
GPU that's the impact or the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.710
major effect on their
performance.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.540
Sometimes it's going to be
the network performance.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.440
Sometimes it's going to
be JavaScript runtime.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.035
So given that the average
developer is looking at this

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.470
huge surface area of problem
that they have to solve, where

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:40.380
should they start first?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.590
What are the major performance
pain points that you see from

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.990
your points of view?

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.650
I guess we'll start at this
end and go down again.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.300
PAUL BAKAUS: OK, so I think
it depends on what you're

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.010
building, really.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.670
But I think if you're building
web apps and websites, it's

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.760
mostly about load time
performance.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.530
I would see load time
performance being the biggest

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.570
bottleneck right now.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.320
There's been recent studies
that e-commerce sites have

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.500
been degrading in terms
of performance--

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.560
I think over 40% percent
or something.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.680
And that's very, very
worrying to me.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.060
And on mobile, it's
even worse.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.490
If the website loads
in over 10 seconds,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.895
most people drop off.

00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:25.280
And of course, it's not entirely
the fault of the

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.610
website and the browser.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.140
It's also network performance,
network latencies.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.800
But I think that's
an area where we

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.620
should focus on first.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.685
With games, as longer-lived the
sessions are for your app

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:42.720
or for your game, the more you
have to focus, obviously, on

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.650
runtime performance, memory
management, lots of stuff.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.180
But I would start
with load time.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.320
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, I suppose
I'm a bit biased in that I

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.830
work on rendering performance,
so that's probably what I'm

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.220
going to say is the most
important thing.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.660
But I do think that we are
moving to this world where

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.850
people expect a lot more out
of web applications.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.130
We're moving from this world
of e-commerce sites and the

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.000
like, which are strongly rooted
in the tradition of the

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.580
web as document viewer, and
we're moving much more towards

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.470
applications where we expect
real-time performance.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.320
And I'll call out James's point
earlier about needing to

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.810
retrain this entire corps of
Facebook developers to do

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.300
native mobile app development
and how painful that was.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.660
But I think it's in some ways
unrealistic to expect that the

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.510
same developer skill set that
applied to building the old

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.560
generation of web applications,
which were very

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.040
rooted in, again, a document
viewer-type model--

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.820
it's unrealistic to expect
that skill set to cleanly

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.160
apply to an application that
you're expecting to do

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.270
something very different.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.280
When you're expecting 60
frames a second and

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.100
complicated UI animations and
transitions, you're building a

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.650
different beast.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.590
It's going to require a
different set of skills.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.320
So I think the entire community
does need to prepare

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.210
for and expect appropriately
that a lot of reeducation is

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.990
going to be required.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.060
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I
work in networks.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.490
And I'm also biased.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.100
But I'll second what
Paul was saying.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.390
But I'll also add a few more
things, which is there's

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.670
obviously the first experience
when you first load the page.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.940
And then there's the rest of the
experience, which is your

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.190
app is loaded, and then the
frames per second and

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.780
everything matters.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.980
So it's not a question
of either/or.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.610
And I would say, if the question
is where do you

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.409
start, I would actually
say it's neither

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.210
one of these three.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.900
So internally, we have been
talking about render, compute,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.789
and network.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.770
Those are the three pillars
of performance.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.930
And the moment you fix one,
you're on to the next.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.530
And then you unlock the
next bottleneck.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.700
So the place to start is to
actually invest into analytics

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.720
to figure out where is my
problem to begin with.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.960
It's not a question of, I know
rendering, so all I'm going to

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.810
focus on rendering.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.050
It's like, well, if your
bottleneck is compute, that's

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.970
where you should start.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.600
So in the network world, at
least, we have put a lot of

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.970
effort into developing tools
like real user measurement

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.750
such that you can gather real
data from real users and real

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.890
hardware and then figure out
that, hey, no, it really is a

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.480
problem on 3G, for example,
from our users to download

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.100
these apps.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.160
And I know you guys have done
a lot of work to figure out

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.550
how to get the games down in
sub-three seconds or even

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.360
sub-one second.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.950
PAUL BAKAUS: That's
right, yeah.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:29.160
ILYA GRIGORIK: And that's a
really interesting challenge.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.310
TOM WILTZIUS: I will also say
that's an area where we are

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.410
way behind on the rendering
side of things.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:41.910
Your ability to measure in
fields anything about how your

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.500
rendering performance is, it's
really hard, to the point

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.790
where you sort of can't do it.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.850
And I think that's the kind of
thing we've talked about, for

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.560
instance, in the web performance
working group,

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.780
about what we might be able
to do about that.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.380
But I think we're not really
closing in on a solution yet,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.650
largely because

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.690
implementations vary so wildly.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.330
So if anyone has bright ideas
about what they would like to

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:13.960
see from a field analytics
API for rendering, I'd

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.800
love to hear it.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.150
ARIYA HIDAYAT: So in my opinion,
evangelism is one

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.350
thing that we need
to work better.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.140
We need to come up with better
vocabulary to the developers.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.430
Those who work in the front end
development space, they

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.960
probably never studied
computer science.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.080
So if I'm being given the task
by my manager to build the

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.160
mobile side of the company, and
then suddenly I need to

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.970
know everything from GPU
compositing to JavaScript Just

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.840
In Time Compiler, garbage
collector, and other

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.940
thingamajig, this is
all scary stuff.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:47.210
So that's one thing that
we need to work more.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.490
And another thing is also to
give the understanding that,

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.620
performance not only, but
optimizing the passport,

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.270
meaning that the bits and piece
from the server and the

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.430
client, with the rise of
single-page application, your

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.640
apps might run for a while.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.130
So for example, if you build an
address book, and sorting

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.380
your contacts, 10 contacts if
10 miliseconds, it doesn't

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.220
mean that they will scale nicely
if you use bubble sort.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.970
So scalability is also important
with respect to

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.410
performance and not only
time measurement.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.750
JAMES PEARCE: So it sounds to
me like there are lots of

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.310
individual technical things
we need to think

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.990
about here as well.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.600
But there is an overall cultural
issue, which is that

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.220
developers who think the web
is something they can just

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.530
lash up in a text editor are now
being dropped into a very

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.190
different world where they are
being expected to use tools

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.610
with 40-character long command
lines and huge, big log spews

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.480
that they have to visualize
and so forth.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.330
So we can come back to some
of the technology, but I'm

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.200
intrigued by this because
there's a tooling piece here,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.730
which is going to make it
a lot easier for people.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.870
And there's best practices
around how they should

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:00.300
instrument their apps, both at,
presumably, development

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.810
time but also at run time.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.380
Maybe the two of you could talk
a little bit about what's

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.450
happening on Chrome, and then
we're going to talk about some

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.190
other browsers, too,
if you don't mind.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.045
So just give us a quick rundown
on tools and education

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.080
and instrumentation as is
it pertains to Chrome.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.430
TOM WILTZIUS: Sure.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.880
You want to kick it off?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.860
ILYA GRIGORIK: Sure.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.990
So for network, I'll highlight
one, which is actually

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.630
cross-browser, which is
Real User Measurement.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.060
So this is a new API--

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:28.130
well, relatively new.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.150
It's supported by all the modern
browsers where when the

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.690
page loads, you can actually
query it to say, give me all

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.180
the time stamps for the sequence
of the loading of the

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.270
page-- so anything from TCP
connection time to there was a

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.060
redirect to this is how much
time it took to load.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.830
And the cool thing about this
is that once you have this

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.520
data, this is from a
real user on a real

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.900
device on a real network.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.910
You can beacon it back to your
analytics, aggregate it, and

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.360
then segment it in a bazillion
different ways and actually

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.530
run meaningful A/B
experiments.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.490
You can actually figure out that
this connection took this

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.670
long and so forth
and so forth.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:03.810
So this alone I think has
changed the network

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.980
performance conversation in a
dramatic way, now that we can

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.980
gather this data.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.730
We need something like
that for GPU.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.310
And maybe it's as simple as
sampling this data and

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.390
beaconing back via a
similar mechanism.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.310
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.620
And that's definitely the kind
of thing, again, where we're

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.270
interested in trying
to explore.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.190
But it is challenging
because the notion--

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.380
people ask for things like,
well I just want how many

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.280
frames a second am I getting.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.450
That's actually not a meaningful
question to ask,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.140
because in a multi-threaded
browser, you can have one to

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.540
four answers to this question.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.390
And you get a different number
of answers depending on what

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.850
browser you're running in.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:50.450
So from a cross-browser
tooling or analytics

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.360
perspective, I think rendering
is one of the toughest because

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.360
it's one of the areas where the
browsers have evolved most

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.200
differently.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.320
But I think we are moving
towards a world where a

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.320
combination of some of the CSS
features that have been speced

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.190
and the performance needs of
the platform are forcing a

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.910
slow reconvergence of how a
lot of these things work.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.430
So I'm cautiously optimistic
that, in the future, we'll be

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.330
able to instrument some of
these things better.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.620
Sorry, go ahead.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.750
ILYA GRIGORIK: So for Chrome
DevTools, we put in a lot of

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.650
effort into instrumenting all
the right bits of the stack so

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:25.130
that you can get at the
root of the problem.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.010
But I think that one challenge
that we have today is you

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.420
still need a lot of education
to know what to look for.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.680
You need to run the trace,
and then you're

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.080
looking at this waterfall.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.100
And you need training.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.230
I know that when I sit
down with somebody--

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.440
with yourself or Paul-- and I
see you guys go through the

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.980
whole workflow, I'm like, oh,
there's five tricks I was

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.070
never aware of just because
I never thought about it.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.290
So what we can do, I think, a
better job of is actually

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.660
giving these kind of insights
to developers, to say here's

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.350
an anti-pattern.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.210
Let's flag it.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.220
Let's put a red flag beside it
and have a Learn More link.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.830
This is the culture piece.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.130
We need to educate people about
what these things are.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.240
I think we've done a fairly good
job on the network side

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.700
because we've been tackling
that problem for longer.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.415
Rendering and other things,
we have a lot of room for

00:15:11.415 --> 00:15:13.790
improvement.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.820
PAUL BAKAUS: Well I just wanted
to say, one big issue,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.505
I think, with rendering
performance and measuring

00:15:17.505 --> 00:15:20.140
rendering performance is because
it's harder to isolate

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.640
it on the actual device--

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.660
because it might be entirely
the user fault why

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.070
rendering is down.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.200
He might have lots of apps open
that do something in the

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.120
background and that
consume memory.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.570
And then text just keep swapping
from memory spaces.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.930
And that's something that I
think is fairly difficult,

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.630
because if you get reports in
from the same device-- let's

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.920
say a Nexus device--

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.350
but to completely randomize,
it's very hard to construct

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.640
data out of that.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.750
I think that's a
real challenge.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.610
TOM WILTZIUS: I think to an
extent that is a challenge

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.830
with network performance as
well, though, because it's

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.840
entirely possible that,
oh, some app

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.500
is swamping my loadable--

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.150
PAUL BAKAUS: App congestion.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.010
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.600
It's the nature of a shared
resource, right?

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.700
I do think though-- to get back
to your original question

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.790
about what are some of the best
tools available, at least

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.450
in Chrome, for debugging
rendering performance--

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.720
compared to where we were maybe
a year ago, we do have

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.660
some features that are
relatively simple and

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.740
incremental, but you get a lot
of mileage out of them.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.580
These are things like the
Vertical Timeline.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:30.220
We have rearchitected the way
our paint rectangle visibility

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.210
feature works.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.420
To work with the latest actual
under-the-hood rendering

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.470
pipeline, we have a mode that
continuously repaints the

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.000
entire page, which helps you
diagnose what is taking a long

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.570
time to paint.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.100
These are relatively simple
things, but they can actually

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.360
go a pretty long way
in debugging sites.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.080
And I know I was talking to Paul
Lewis, one of our other

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.600
developer advocates, just before
this talk about people

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.650
who were coming by earlier at
the Chrome Perf Alley thing

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:04.410
over at Moscone, and, I think,
often weren't aware that this

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.670
was a big problem or weren't
aware of how they would even

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.920
begin to start addressing this
but, with a little bit of

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.869
education about how to use these
tools, actually came

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.599
away with a lot of things
that they could go

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:15.730
investigate on their own.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.280
So I think, yes, that
is cultural.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.345
Yes, that is educational.

00:17:18.345 --> 00:17:20.180
And I think we're starting
to have some better

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.960
tools in this space.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:27.069
But for the really hard cases,
we're still not there.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:34.220
ARIYA HIDAYAT: So related to the
performance and tools, we

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.990
also need to educate developers
to include

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.750
performance metric as part of
their development workflow.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.230
For example, you build
a fantastic game.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.590
You've built a nice scroller,
nice apps, and it scrolls

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.480
beautifully.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.770
And then suddenly some intern,
junior engineer, whoever, are

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.100
checking some code.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.340
Probably he has a good
intention, but the performance

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.770
drops from 60 frames per second
to 30, and there's no

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.480
way to detect that.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.810
ILYA GRIGORIK: So can I
add just one thing?

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:02.640
So prior to focusing on network
performance, I was

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.450
actually part of the Google
Analytics team, so there's my

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.700
another bias.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.420
Performance is a feature.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.530
When we talk about your
performance drops, your

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.830
conversion drops, your
engagement drops, we have good

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.020
measurements--

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.590
as you mentioned before, where
convergence dropped by 4%.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.950
There's not many features you
can add to an e-commerce site

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:25.940
that will bump your revenue
per user by 4%.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:28.550
So it is a feature
like any other.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.500
It should be prioritized on your
backlog like any other.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.840
It's not a sprint that
you do at the end to

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.820
clean up your app.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.410
It's like, I'm going to build
this thing, and then I'm going

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.820
to fix performance.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.410
You can't slap on performance,
just like you can't slap on

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.750
security at the end.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.920
So invest early into measuring
this stuff.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.170
How does this actually translate
to my users?

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.060
I think this is a very,
very important metric.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.630
JAMES PEARCE: All right, I want
to do a little straw poll

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.160
here if possible.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.230
How many people here in the
audience, if you're developing

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.100
for mobile and you're developing
for the mobile web,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.060
if you find a performance
problem, do you

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.130
know what to do?

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.810
Do you feel like you have all
the tools you need to be able

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:10.820
to go and diagnose it?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.280
Do you feel you have the
understanding about network

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.290
GPU, especially in the mobile
case, to go and solve that?

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.470
Who feels that they are totally
tooled up and ready to

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.170
go, cross-browser,
cross-device.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:24.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:24.800
JAMES PEARCE: Nobody.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.880
OK, so there's obviously
work to be down.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.100
But I think cross-browser
thing is important.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.350
And I know this is predominantly
a Chrome

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.770
session, but I think--

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.580
oh, it's Deon.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.685
Deon, where are you?

00:19:36.685 --> 00:19:38.920
You have a question which,
I think, is to

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.120
do with other browsers.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.390
Would you like to stand
up and ask?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.670
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.666
Hi, Deon [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:46.165
Labs.

00:19:46.165 --> 00:19:49.658
And so you set up my question
very nicely.

00:19:49.658 --> 00:19:50.908
MALE SPEAKER: Do you
have the mic?

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:56.990
JAMES PEARCE: I'm wondering
whether A/V is easier or

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.610
harder than web performance
at this point?

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.905
ARIYA HIDAYAT: It's wired.

00:19:59.905 --> 00:20:01.920
They should have the
wireless mic.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.950
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.730
So we have that exact
pain point.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:07.390
The Chrome Developer
Tools are amazing.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:10.800
There's good developer tools
across other browsers

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.460
and that like that.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.640
But I watch all the developers
on the team coming up with

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.340
this problem on some ancient
Android browser that's being

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.390
used by someone in the UK or
some BlackBerry user or

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:23.730
someone else.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.160
And they have to go and re-learn
a different tool for

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.700
everything.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.480
It's like the equivalent that
we've joked about before,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.920
where you have "Friends" is
really successful on TV, and

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.320
then you've got to
make the DVD.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.860
And you've got to re-cast
everyone and film it again

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.670
from scratch.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.920
It just is so painful.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.530
And then you get the Sony
MiniDisc version that just has

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.704
your buddies in it.

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:48.680
So is there any hope
coming there?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.650
TOM WILTZIUS: To a certain
extent, this is a pretty

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.610
difficult thing you're asking
for, because the point of many

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.210
independent but interoperable
implementations of web

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.520
browsers is that the
implementations are different.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.040
So if what you really want is
visibility into the guts of

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.490
the thing, which is, I think,
often what people ask for,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.410
then that's tough.

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:19.860
I think, honestly, the real
hope is two-fold.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:26.100
One, the performance pain points
that are most obvious

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.010
and most easy to stumble on will
be ironed out over time

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:38.100
as those real legacy browsers
go away and modern browsers

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.920
care a lot more and compete with
each other to try to stay

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.000
performant.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.550
And then from a standardization
perspective,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.420
we get very good APIs defined
and everyone sticks to them.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:53.760
We're doing a lot of work to
make sure that, especially in

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.950
a world with Blink, another
rendering engine, we stay as

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.820
interoperable as possible when
it comes to spec compliance.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.950
But people don't spec
performance.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.340
So what we're relying on to make
sure performance is just

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:10.390
good is competition
between browsers.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.420
I think that's healthy.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.850
I think that's going to work.

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:18.240
And hopefully that will push
the performance ceiling--

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.040
or floor, depending on
how you look at it--

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.120
to a point where you don't need
to worry as much about

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.920
huge differences like these
cliffs existing only in some

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.480
browsers but not in others.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.780
And we'll get to only things
that are fundamentally,

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.420
because of the specification
or something, too slow, and

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.800
then we can have conversations
about how we can improve them

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.865
by changing the APIs.

00:22:39.865 --> 00:22:42.250
JAMES PEARCE: So Paul, I'm
guessing you probably have a

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.870
fairly large surface area that
you're looking to deal with,

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.390
and you do have perf specs.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.600
You do know what frames per
second you have to get to.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.470
PAUL BAKAUS: That's right.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.280
JAMES PEARCE: Would you like
to share those with us?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.670
PAUL BAKAUS: Well, first of
all, I wanted to say that,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:57.560
regarding the specs, I think
it's super odd that

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.400
performance is not
part of spec.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.570
And I've been talking about
this on the W3C-level odd.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.730
And what's weird is that in most
other standards bodies,

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.620
performance is actually
part of spec.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.340
So in the LTE spec, for
instance, performance is a

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.380
large part of it.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.160
And I find it super odd that
it's not being done on the

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.290
W3C, level.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.210
So that's first.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:23.330
And so, on the product side, we
are also taking performance

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:26.500
very seriously from the start
and adding it to the spec.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.010
So we'd like to be at
60 FPS for run-time

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.120
performance, sure.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.860
We have goals to stay below
three seconds for load time,

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.130
at least on Wi-Fi And LTE.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:44.920
If you're on a 3G connection,
all bets are off, because even

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.590
just activating the radio signal
to the next cell can

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.750
take up to a couple seconds.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.340
So at that point, you don't have
much influence over it.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.440
But yes, I think the point about
regression that Ariya

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.490
mentioned is a good point,
because if you have it in a

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:04.520
spec really early, performance
metrics for your features,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.270
what you want to build, you
start thinking about it

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:07.780
differently.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.040
And with every commit, you
continue measuring if it

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.820
degraded your performance
or not, whether

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.880
you're still on track.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.340
And I think that that's what's
super important, not

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.570
specifically whether you're
looking for to have your

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.020
upload in three or five seconds,
but really just

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.640
making sure you have a spec.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.530
JAMES PEARCE: And what is your
target device portfolio?

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.100
Do you set the floor at a
particular version of a

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.790
particular browser?

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.420
And--

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.160
by the way, I'm interested--
what do you do for users that

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.820
happen to have an
inappropriately poor device?

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.900
PAUL BAKAUS: So I'm happy to
say that the stuff we're

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.550
building right now has
a fairly large

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.320
set of browser support.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.940
So, for instance, on Android,
we're targeting

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.530
Gingerbread and up--

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.510
which is, as you know if you've
worked with Android on

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.570
mobile performance, Gingerbread
is quite a

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.220
challenge because it only
has the stock browser.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.760
Well, I'm not sure if you can
install Chrome mobile on

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.090
Gingerbread.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:07.815
I don't think you can.

00:25:07.815 --> 00:25:09.150
ARIYA HIDAYAT: You can
install Opera.

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.330
PAUL BAKAUS: You can install
Opera, but not many people do

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.260
it, I think.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.180
At least that's my guess.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.030
I don't have data on it.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.670
Sorry about that.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.830
But yeah, it's a
real challenge.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:26.980
That being said, I also think
there's a place to build games

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.330
and apps that push the edge.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.270
I just wrote a blog post
about this, actually.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:40.190
I was arguing that many managers
really think HTML5 in

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.920
particular has a performance
issue.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.760
I don't think that's fair.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.620
I think no user complains--

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.270
well, some do, but I argue
they're stupid.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.120
But usual users don't complain
that their latest PC game

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.600
doesn't run well on their

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.160
10-year-old Windows XP computer.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.145
But people do with HTML5.

00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:06.186
I see managers trying to load
apps in IE8 on bad hardware,

00:26:06.186 --> 00:26:07.520
and they're complaining
about it.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.710
And that has to stop.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.980
That's just not fair.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:15.200
And I think we need
to push it more.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.690
ARIYA HIDAYAT: So we can also
view it from a different

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.250
perspective.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.426
How many of you here have
heard about RoboHornet?

00:26:29.426 --> 00:26:30.680
Oh, good.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.290
So the idea behind this
benchmark is to come up with a

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:36.580
common set, bearing any standard
performance metrics

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.380
from the standard bodies, that
can be run in all browsers.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:43.140
And that should be, if you've
got the buy-in from the

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.560
browser vendors--

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.700
for example, inserting a
thousand rows in the table

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.370
should not get slower as the
browser gets new release.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.110
For example, IE12 should not be
slower compared to IE11 or

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.990
IE10 with respect to doing
that kind of stuff.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.390
So if that is part of the
development workflow from the

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.395
browser vendor themself, then
they know for sure that, hey,

00:27:05.395 --> 00:27:08.680
if I degrade this performance,
then some real-world

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.270
application like Google Apps
or frameworks like Sencha

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:15.315
Touch Mobile that will have
a performance impact.

00:27:15.315 --> 00:27:19.080
ILYA GRIGORIK: So getting back
to the tooling question across

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.860
different platforms, I think we
have some good answers for

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:22.600
the network side.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.230
So for example, we have project
open source products

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.560
like WebPagetest which allow
you to run a test against

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.170
different browsers-- so IE,
Chrome, and the rest-- and get

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.130
the same visual output.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:35.740
And that is already a great
start because I know DevTools

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.900
really, really well, but I
haven't been using the IE

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.990
tools for a while.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.290
So at least now, you can put
them side by side and say,

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.370
here's A. Here's B. And now I
can compare the waterfalls and

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.590
compare that.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.860
And we've developed, basically,
bottom-up specs for

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.330
that-- so HTTP Archive Spec,
where we can right-click on

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.430
the waterfall and export
it and import it

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.660
into a different tool.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.970
We have an export for the
Timeline in Chrome, but we

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:58.750
don't have a tool.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.250
It would be cool if you could
export a rendering timeline

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:04.580
from Firefox and also have a
similar tool where you could

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.380
compare them and say, I'm
getting x FPS here and y FPS

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.440
over there.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.506
That's all doable, I think.

00:28:13.506 --> 00:28:15.720
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, again,
modular the fact that people

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.800
ask for FPS not realizing that
this is a difficult thing to

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.690
really standardize what
the term even means.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.790
But your point's absolutely
a good one.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:30.600
And actually I'll tie that to
what we were saying about

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.450
measuring performance
regressions.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:38.120
We have a framework, I guess I'd
call it, that we've used

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.360
to monitor Chrome performance
as we develop Chrome.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.750
It's called Telemetry.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.975
It's something you
can go check out.

00:28:46.975 --> 00:28:48.930
We have some documentation on
the Chromium Dev site if

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:49.670
you're interested.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.310
But basically it's a Python
harness that talks to Chrome

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:58.065
via the Chrome Developer Tools
protocol and instructs it to

00:28:58.065 --> 00:29:00.950
do simple things like load a
page, scroll it, get a bunch

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.000
of stats back out.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.140
But again, these are
implementation-specific stats,

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:06.830
which is painful.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.410
But then we can monitor for
like scrolling performance

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:10.650
regressions, for instance.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.130
And if people like external
developers want to plug their

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:18.440
own content into this and keep
the version of Chrome fixed

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.550
but iterate on that content, I
think this could be a useful

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.040
tool for that.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.800
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I think what
we can do to make that better

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.320
is make it simpler.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.810
TOM WILTZIUS: And then make
it work across browsers.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.270
ILYA GRIGORIK: Because if you
would do a WebPagetest, as I

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.590
come to a web page, I type in,
literally, the name of the

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.180
page, and I just say
IE10 or IE9.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:35.360
And I'm done.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.930
Right now to run Telemetry,
it's like, yeah, check out

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.270
Chromium and just build it.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.260
It's like, look.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.570
And then there's the fact
that it's a [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:43.020
checkup.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.940
TOM WILTZIUS: It does work
with stock Chrome matter.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.550
But yeah, your point's
a good one.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.040
And I wonder--

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.490
I don't know if we need to get
buy-in from other browser

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.890
vendors or what-- how
we can make this

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.740
work with other browsers.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:58.310
We need a standard way of
communicating from outside the

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.150
browser in.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.160
JAMES PEARCE: So we actually
have a related question on the

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.435
moderator here, which is
the from Andre Behrens.

00:30:05.435 --> 00:30:06.190
Here?

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.530
No?

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:08.090
Yes.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.000
Would you like to come up and
ask it regarding Chrome

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.818
performance versus--

00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:15.530
ANDRE: Sure.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:16.660
JAMES PEARCE: You're
on record.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:17.562 --> 00:30:18.812
ANDRE: Great.

00:30:25.644 --> 00:30:29.040
Yeah, my question was simply--

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.470
I have a pretty heavy
app that I work on--

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.620
why is the performance on
certain things quick as the

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.330
dickens on an iPad currently
and not on a Nexus 10?

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.400
Are they cheating?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.670
Is there a hardware cheat?

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.760
Or is it just enough time?

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.800
Or where are the slowdowns at?

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.680
Because I notice
them sometimes.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.090
It's a lot better, but
I notice them.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.740
TOM WILTZIUS: You're talking
about rendering

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.670
performance, I assume?

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.070
ANDRE: Yes.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.680
TOM WILTZIUS: Or do you have
specific operations in mind?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.530
ANDRE: The one that really gets
me is touch response and

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.980
rendering after the
touch response.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.120
And I'm doing a big,
heavy, nasty thing.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.065
It's that I'm moving a lot
of DOM nodes around.

00:31:09.065 --> 00:31:13.070
But on the Pixel, it's
really great.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:14.720
On my computer, it's
really great.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.420
On the iPad, it's
really great.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.130
On most Android devices,
it's pretty good.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.400
And I'm wondering what
the difference is?

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:29.010
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, so some of
this is a resource question.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:35.080
I love the comparison between
iPads and iPhones and Android

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.580
devices because it shows we're
in the same league, even

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.510
though they're half the price.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:45.480
But I do think that it remains
a challenge for us to make

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.080
good on all the performance
promises of comparison.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.350
So to a certain extent,
we have our work

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.380
cut out for us there.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.650
But it is something we're
working on very hard, and

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.220
hopefully we'll just get
better underneath you

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.470
as time goes on.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.450
The latest versions of Chrome
for Android, which is to say

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.970
those that have come out in
the last few months, have

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.630
actually a radically different
rendering architecture than

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:14.510
the ones that came out,
say, at this time last

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.900
year, at I/O 2012.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.680
And we're going to continue
making changes at almost that

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.250
big a pace.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.430
So right now, one of the things
we're looking at, for

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:28.130
instance, is what can we do
about input latency, which

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.210
it's probably not
the exact silver

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.930
bullet for your problem.

00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.230
But it's very much related.

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.520
And part of Chrome's very
complicated multi-process

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.210
architecture is that we do a
lot of threat hopping, and

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.520
this is really hurting
performance when it comes to

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.490
input latency.

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.660
This is something
we're looking at

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.090
revamping right now.

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.390
So our hope is a lot of
this will get better.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:58.420
I don't think there's anything
fundamental here.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.970
I do want to point out
one other thing

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.350
though, which is also--

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:04.050
I don't want to make excuses,
but it is a lot more

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:09.030
challenging to change things
that are so related to things

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:13.780
like touch input because they we
work across five operating

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.500
systems, not one.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.960
And that's a major challenge.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:18.700
JAMES PEARCE: OK.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.230
We're actually a little
pushed for time.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.640
Time flies when you're
having fun.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.370
But I did have one final
question, and then we're going

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.380
to go around with
the conclusion,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.580
which is perhaps related.

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.310
I'm not sure if there's a GPU
issue or a networking issue.

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.080
But I have a very specific
question from Charles Ying,

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.730
which is, are there any efforts
in place to optimize

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.640
the power consumption
of Chrome right now?

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.790
This is something that web
developers have never really

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.964
thought about before, but
now they do have to.

00:33:45.964 --> 00:33:48.250
TOM WILTZIUS: I can speak to
this one if you want to.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.033
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I'm curious
about the "do have to." Do you

00:33:51.033 --> 00:33:52.470
have a good example in mind?

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.420
Is that something that you
guys optimize for?

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.150
JAMES PEARCE: Well on the
assumption that people spend

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.880
25% of their time on smartphones
on Facebook, I

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.680
suppose we have a responsibility
to make sure

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.180
it's not using up their
batteries too much.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.890
But I would imagine the
same goes for games.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.280
You don't want to be the,
quote, "app that is

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.650
responsible for killing
someone's battery in a day."

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.955
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I think
maybe a year ago--

00:34:14.955 --> 00:34:16.710
we were just talking
before this panel--

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.199
talking about FPS in a browser
was a new concept

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.400
for a lot of people.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.969
I think talking about battery
life today in a browser is a

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:25.320
new concept for a lot of people

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.690
because, what do you mean?

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:28.699
I'm just rendering a web page.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.730
That is not the case, because
we're building apps.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.179
And these apps are running
for a long time.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:32.989
They have memory leaks.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.030
They have other things.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.880
On networking side, there are
lots of great examples where

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.630
we're doing things
wrong today--

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.580
things like, let me just slap
on a real time analytics

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.370
beacon on my page, because
it's awesome.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.810
I get a nice vanity dashboard
that shows me the number of

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.870
people on my site.

00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.120
And then every five seconds,
you're pinging the radio and

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.389
just burning the fricking
battery on the device.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:58.260
And so those are good examples
of where we need

00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.930
to fix these patterns.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.100
I think we need to educate
developers.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.040
We need to educate the companies
that are building

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.160
these things.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.820
Google Analytics actually
addressed this

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.840
about a year ago.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.150
But I've done a recent survey of
other real-time analytics.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.760
They're all doing the
same problem.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.170
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, I think, to
be perfectly honest, from a

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.170
rendering standpoint, we are
so bottlenecked on core

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.860
performance right now that power
consumption, while we

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.280
definitely worry about
it, it's lower on our

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.610
hierarchy of worries.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.090
And the reason is that, as we
improve performance, we are

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:36.170
only going to improve
power consumption.

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:40.810
So right now, to scroll a web
page in Chrome for Android on

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:45.350
an older generation Nexus
device-- so a Nexus S or

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:46.020
something-- yeah?

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.150
Greg, you want to
say something?

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.550
GREG SIMON: Yeah.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.070
TOM WILTZIUS: Burns all
your CPU, which

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:50.870
burns all your power.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:51.520
So we got to fix that.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.670
GREG SIMON: Yeah, we do care
a lot about power.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.380
And we're actually working right
now on making changes to

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:01.540
our Telemetry, which is a Python
framework for running

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.500
tests on Chrome Desktop, Chrome
OS, Chrome on Android.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.340
So we're working on
making changes to

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.590
actually measure power.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.650
Sorry, I am Greg Simon.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:19.300
I work with the Blink
team and others.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.110
ARIYA HIDAYAT: So in some cases,
this also needs some

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:23.150
cooperation from the
hardware vendor.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.305
For example, Qualcomm has
a very nice profiler.

00:36:25.305 --> 00:36:26.830
I can't remember the name.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:30.700
But that gives you the exact
measurement of the consumption

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.790
from the radio to the GPU.

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.530
And that's very important
metrics because if I build my

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.300
game using WebGL and then
suddenly it burns more power

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.290
than as if you would have
written with [INAUDIBLE], then

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.140
that's not good proposition.

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.090
ILYA GRIGORIK: And I just want
to add, one thing I'd love to

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:50.240
see as part of either DevTools
or any sort of tool chain is,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.740
for example, visibility
into the radio.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.670
Paul, you mentioned that
sometimes just turning on the

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.600
radio takes, literally,
seconds and

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.990
burns a lot of battery.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.350
Having understanding and
visibility into how the radio

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.360
operates can have
a huge impact.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.380
We don't have any

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.680
instrumentation across any platform.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.450
Even the native apps don't
really have good

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:11.440
instrumentation.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.950
I was looking-- so Qualcomm
is a great example.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.960
AT&amp;T actually has
a great tool.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.110
There's basically no other tool
where you can actually

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.880
record a session on your
phone, and then--

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.470
it's not an exact measurement--
but it will

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:28.080
model the radio states and the
actual battery consumption.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.270
It'll tell you, this
app consumed x

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.440
many joules of energy.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.990
And that's a start.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.340
JAMES PEARCE: Cool.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.390
We have time, I think, for one
question from the floor.

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.820
AUDIENCE: So we were talking
about actual performance and

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.300
real numbers and what we could
do to improve things, but we

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.210
were also talking about
the education.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.260
Do you think we should put
more time into educating

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.660
people about perceived
performance?

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.535
Because we only have certain
limits that we have right now,

00:37:54.535 --> 00:37:58.770
like 3G, so should we talk more
about, not fall-backs,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.160
but different angles of how to
make things better for users

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.810
without building new devices?

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.110
PAUL BAKAUS: Oh, yeah.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.820
I would say absolutely.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:13.090
I think that's a great point.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.960
As internal at Zynga, we always
think about actual

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.230
performance and perceived
performance, responsiveness.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.700
And that starts with
easy stuff.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.390
If you click a button,
make it do something

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.190
while you're waiting.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:29.580
Or if you're loading your
page, show a loader.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.690
Do something.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:37.830
Put something out to the user,
so that anxiety of waiting

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:39.820
isn't perceived the same way.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.650
And there's all kinds of
techniques to do that, and I

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:47.080
think it's important to educate
people about those.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.280
JAMES PEARCE: Any interest in
getting one more question in?

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:50.890
Do you want a question?

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.170
AUDIENCE: No, actually, I want
to answer the power question.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.660
JAMES PEARCE: Oh, wants to
answer the power question.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.410
Unless anyone has any more
on that previous point?

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.990
TOM WILTZIUS: No, you should
let Chris go for it.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.885
JAMES PEARCE: Go ahead.

00:38:59.885 --> 00:39:00.940
AUDIENCE: So I'm Chris
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.480
I'm the tech leader for the
Chrome for Android.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.860
So I think to answer the power
question is Android actually

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.730
does have the tools to measure
the power, and they're very

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.175
precise, the tools.

00:39:15.175 --> 00:39:17.190
The device is called the
[INAUDIBLE] device.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.350
They basically replace the
battery on the phone, and they

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.750
measure on the per-amp base
for all the actions.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.310
And then they publish all the
open source how to hook up the

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.360
tools with Android platform.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.090
So if you have a web app, you
can run the apps and then to

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.880
monitor what action
can trigger it.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.620
So as a developer, I will
suggest the things is try to

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.720
not put a lot timers, especially
just because on the

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.310
mobile device, when CPU is
running in the high frequency,

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:50.080
it is burning a lot
of battery.

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.200
And for the multicore devices,
sometimes they

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.280
keep one core working.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.450
But if a CPU working load is
higher, they're going to bring

00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.340
up more cores.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.000
So the more cores means
more power usage.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.120
And then they have this way is
basically after a couple

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.450
milliseconds, no activity,
they're going to

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:10.180
crank down the power.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:15.590
But if you keep every, say,
two seconds and you fire a

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.170
timer yourself and try to
check something in the

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.530
background, and if nothing
happened, you sleep.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.930
But the device is going to
basically keep running this

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.940
high power mode and
then basically

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.360
going to burn the battery.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.890
And also things for the radio
things is every time one radio

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.380
is taking a little bit of longer
time to bring up, and

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.530
then they normally keep it
in the longer times.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.870
And another case, for
example, as Wi-Fi.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.240
So probably people having device
with the Wi-Fi this

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.770
week experienced the bad
experience, bad battery life

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:51.750
in the Moscone center.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.840
Because Wi-Fi bad, so the device
keeps trying to connect

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.502
to the Wi-Fi, and then that
also burn the batteries.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.450
JAMES PEARCE: Two minutes?

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:01.150
Got two minutes left?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.960
All right, OK.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:03.790
We started late.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.180
We are using up time.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.750
So if we could just quickly go
around, I have two questions.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.410
You have 30 seconds to answer
two questions each.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:15.330
And the first question is if I'm
an average web developer

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.070
and I want to take away
something that I can start

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.330
doing right now to make my web
apps more performant, what

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.400
would that one thing be?

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.580
And secondly, if you could cast
a magic spell to make

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.080
mobile web performance a better
place, assuming you had

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.910
the power of the Google Chrome
team for example, what would

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:32.690
that one thing be?

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.120
Go ahead--

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.030
30 seconds each.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.910
PAUL BAKAUS: OK, so first thing,
I'm going to give you

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:39.210
an actionable item on actual
improving your perceived

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.210
responsiveness of your app but
also saving your battery life.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:47.100
And that is any time the app
doesn't have anything to do--

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.740
for instance if your app
needs a login flow.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.230
So you started a login,
username, password, input--

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.730
at that time, do a big network
burst to load all your data in

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.520
the background because, after
the user logs in, he will have

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.140
all the stuff loaded already.

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:07.110
And the chance is very likely he
doesn't quit the app before

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:11.620
logging in, so that's a great
point in which you should be

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.390
loading data.

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:13.180
JAMES PEARCE: And the
one thing you

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.170
would fix if you could?

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:15.780
PAUL BAKAUS: The one
thing I would fix

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.180
is, let's see, scrolling.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.862
Yeah, give us good scrolling
APIs on Chrome Mobile.

00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:25.830
TOM WILTZIUS: You
want the APIs?

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:26.760
PAUL BAKAUS: I want APIs.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.020
Yeah, Microsoft has them.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.812
Chrome doesn't.

00:42:30.812 --> 00:42:32.480
TOM WILTZIUS: All right.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.210
I guess my one takeaway would
be that you should be aware

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:42.240
that jank is a problem, and it's
a hard problem to solve.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.510
But we do have some tools
to solve it, and I would

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.430
encourage you to check out a lot
of our developer relations

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.580
resources on how to use
Chrome's DevTools

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.540
to fight that jank.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.960
I gave a talk about this
yesterday, but even basic

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.420
tools like Show paint rectangles
or Show composited

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.360
layer borders or the Vertical
Timeline go really far.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.460
JAMES PEARCE: And you are the
fairy godmother, so what is

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.650
the one thing you can
fix for everybody?

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.082
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, right.

00:43:06.082 --> 00:43:07.880
That's a good question.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.000
I guess I was going to phrase
my answer somewhat

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.710
differently, because I wasn't
going to fix something.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.340
I was going to change the
way a lot of the web's

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.220
specifications were built so
that we're not stuck in such

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.055
complicated scenarios.

00:43:18.055 --> 00:43:18.637
JAMES PEARCE: Ah, that counts.

00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:19.350
That counts.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.300
Go ahead.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:21.850
TOM WILTZIUS: There are a lot
of things that we would like

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:26.380
to be able to do that we're a
little bit hemmed in by the

00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.190
immense, expansive API
service of the web.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.980
So I am happy that on mobile
we've been able to move a

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.050
little bit faster.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.330
I want us to be able to move a
little bit faster everywhere.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.410
I think one of the ways we're
going to do that without

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.410
actually causing pain by
changing things is by

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:43.620
introducing new primitives into
the web that are going to

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.070
allow us to have the
pit of awesome--

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.710
the things that are only going
to be fast, but you're going

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.090
to be able to do less
inside of them.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:51.750
We have ideas around, for
instance, infinite list

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.100
containers that are just
going to work.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:57.160
And you won't be able to have
crazy overhanging floats, but

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.150
it'll be fast.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:59.240
And that'll be good.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.080
JAMES PEARCE: Infinite list

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.223
controllers in a pit of awesome.

00:44:02.223 --> 00:44:02.930
Yeah.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:03.975
Can we have that by tomorrow?

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:04.620
TOM WILTZIUS: Sure.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:04.960
JAMES PEARCE: Thank you.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.600
Ilya?

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.870
ILYA GRIGORIK: Let's see, so
maybe coming back to perceived

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.530
performance, I think that's
a really good point.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:13.090
And coming back to education
as well, I think developers

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.840
should learn about the radio and
how it works, this mobile

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.600
radio thing.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.470
Because we keep complaining
about mobile network being

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:21.890
slow, unpredictable, so much
latency, variability.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:23.800
Once you actually learn
how the basics of

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.790
those things work--

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.720
you probably need to spend a
couple of hours just reading

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.170
about how it works--

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.140
you can actually model most
of these high-latency

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.470
environments really,
really well.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.440
Anticipate them, and then you
very quickly realize that an

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.450
average thing, like an
average request over

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:39.200
3G, will take a second.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.630
That directly tells you
something about how you design

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.600
your application, how you
structure, how your UI works

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.460
and all the rest.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.160
JAMES PEARCE: Magic wish?

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.330
ILYA GRIGORIK: Magic wish--

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.660
faster than speed of light
travel, because that would

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.120
solve all of our latency
problems.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.620
JAMES PEARCE: That is magical

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.130
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:59.960
That network performance--
solved.

00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:03.700
But I don't think we're
going to get that.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.160
Yeah.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.390
JAMES PEARCE: All right,
well, never mind.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.920
ARIYA HIDAYAT: So like what Ilya
said, treat performance

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.460
as a feature, automate
performance measurement, put

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.200
it as part of your development
workflow, CI system, whatever,

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.140
even if it's just a
simple smoke test.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.650
Create that git precommit hook
that blocks the check-in if

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.948
something gets lower.

00:45:24.948 --> 00:45:25.780
JAMES PEARCE: All right,
and the magic wish?

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.870
ARIYA HIDAYAT: The
magic wish--

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.250
so, more parallelism.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.980
So the Samsung Galaxy S4
Internet Edition this eight

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.510
core CPU, a big-LITTLE Endian
and a big-LITTLE architecture.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:38.330
So I think we're going to see
probably 16 core mobile CPU in

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.350
the near future, so more
parallelism in the browser

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:41.280
will be very awesome.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.385
JAMES PEARCE: All right,
that's it.

00:45:43.385 --> 00:45:43.690
We're over.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:44.070
That's a wrap.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:44.580
Thank you, everyone.

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:50.580
[APPLAUSE]
