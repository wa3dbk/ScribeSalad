00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:01.540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Wow.

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.870
Everybody's all quiet
and ready to go.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.445
How are you guys doing today?

00:00:04.445 --> 00:00:04.880
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.400
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
We got some more

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.570
seats up here in front.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.830
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Couple of seat--

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.095
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Scattered around.

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:08.960
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --if anybody
wants to sit down.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.180
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Wants it.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.546
Good.

00:00:10.546 --> 00:00:13.990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Welcome to
The Art of Organizational

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.200
Manipulation.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.500
I am Bryan Fitzpatrick.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.760
Most people call me Fitz.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And I
am Ben Collins-Sussman.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.690
Everybody calls me Ben
Collins-Sussman.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:23.660
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So we are

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.620
engineering managers at Google.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.380
I see a lot of familiar faces
in the audience--

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.760
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.650
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --which
is pretty cool.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.740
And we started the Chicago
engineering office back 1,000

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.790
years ago in 2005.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.290
And we've been working as
engineers and engineering

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.560
managers for a lot
longer than that.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.170
And in the course of our
travels, like he said, we've

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.910
gone from software engineers
to management.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.880
We've worked on a bunch
of teams in Google.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.110
We worked in open source
for many years.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.310
And so over that period of time
we've sort of developed a

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.470
bunch of stories and experiences
that we want to

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.400
share with you.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.330
And we've been doing that
for a few years now.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.520
And this year we want to talk
about life inside a large

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.470
corporation.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As usual,
we like to start our talks

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.110
also with a disclaimer.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.990
We have a very brief one here.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.320
And basically, the same thing
that applies to all our talks,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440
which is that these
are our opinions.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.350
And some of it doesn't actually
apply if you're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.540
working for morons or
if you are a moron.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.750
But our point here is that
this is our opinions.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.090
And if you don't like it, you
can get your own talk.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
And lastly, we think that what
we're talking about here is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.240
not the only way to
do engineering.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.400
But we think it's the most
effective way to spend your

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.970
time when you're working
in engineering.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.630
It's true.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Doing
software engineering is fun

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.750
and a lot of work.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.140
But really, if you want to be
super efficient and effective,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.100
you need to learn to work with
people and with corporations.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.640
So, that takes us to our next
slide, which is that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.850
corporations, companies, as you
think about them, they are

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.600
not made out of source code.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.970
And they're not made out of--

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Compilers.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
compilers.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.510
They're not made out of
brick and mortar.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.920
They're actually made
out of people.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Companies are
made entirely of people.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.570
And people are what not only
make things happen, but people

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.210
in companies are what prevents
things from happening in a lot

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.740
of cases, as well.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.199
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or cause
things to happen.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.750
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Or, yeah.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.110
Occasionally, they do cause
something to happen.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.270
But more than anything, if
you're going to be an engineer

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.930
in a big company and make things
happen, you need to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.740
learn how to navigate them.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.350
OK.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.280
Now if you're in a small
company or a start-up--

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.170
in fact, maybe we should do a
quick-- how many people here

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.570
work in a company of less
than 15 people?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.880
OK.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.660
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's
like half the audience.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.545
16 to 100?

00:02:31.545 --> 00:02:33.692
100 to 1,000?

00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:34.360
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
There we go.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Bigger
than 1,000?

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Woh.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, OK.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
There we go.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.880
You're going to like this.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.550
So, you're the guys who need the
flashlight, a GPS, and a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.670
big truck of bread crumbs to
navigate your organization.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
All right.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: All right.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.910
So that's a lot about what
we're here to talk about.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.440
Now, I'm aware--

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Some people--

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:52.560
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--that the term--

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:53.630
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--organizational

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.910
manipulation's a little weird.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's a
little sensational, isn't it.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's
a little bit-- we like

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.480
sensational titles, like
poisonous people,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.670
that sort of thing.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We could
have just said a talk about

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.400
office politics.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.796
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:03:03.796 --> 00:03:04.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.020
But we like to call it
organizational manipulation.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You could
also call it social

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.760
engineering, if you like.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ah.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.950
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, there's
three parts to this talk.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.370
We're going to give
away all the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.860
surprises at the beginning.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.630
There's three parts.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.840
We're gonna talk about working
in the ideal company, the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.950
reality,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.806
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just to
get a nice diff there.

00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:23.780
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.940
The company that most people
find themselves in at one

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.170
point or another and
that we found

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.750
ourselves in in the past.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.140
And lastly is the manipulation,
which is the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.280
awesome part.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.940
But most companies are
a blend of the ideal

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.290
and sort of the reality.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.510
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So you get
to pick and choose what

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.010
applies to your situation--

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.370
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.140
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
--as we chat.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.750
So let's start with the
perfect environment.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.320
Like, what should it be like
to work in a large

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.230
corporation, right?

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:47.880
Let's talk about--

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.980
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: We'll make
this quick because this isn't

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.640
very interesting.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.550
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No,
it's good stuff.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.020
I like this.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.880
So the first thing that you need
to think about-- at least

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.350
what we preach in a lot of our
talks-- is that management is

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.010
a bad word.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.880
That really we talk about
leadership, not management

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.850
Because the worst thing that
managers do is they manage,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.920
and that's--

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.520
stop managing, start leading.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.040
And what it means to lead is
it means you should be a

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.100
servant to your team.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.080
If you have a good leader--

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.490
could be a manager, could be
the person you report to--

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.360
their job is not to tell
you how to do your job.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.339
Their job is to remove
roadblocks and be like a

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.970
butler to your team, make
sure everyone is

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.360
efficient and happy.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.620
And I'm sure that's exactly the
way it is in your company.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.660
But that's the ideal
that we preach.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.390
And that's what we try to

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.120
practice as managers ourselves.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
often fail at.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.220
That's how we learn.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.970
So we get better at these
things, I think.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But I mean,
when I first started out, the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.710
first time I had a meeting with
our CEO, at the time Eric

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.440
Schmidt, he came to Chicago.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.390
Had this long meeting
with him.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.540
I was very nervous.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.020
And he was asking me all
these questions.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.570
At the end of the meeting he
leaned back, he said, so what

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.360
do you need?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.550
I mean, I had done all this
preparation for all these

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.370
answers to all these questions
he was gonna ask me.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.880
I had no answer for this.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.320
I just sort of, I'm like, what
do you mean what do I need?

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.020
I'm just some dude.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.330
You're the CEO, man.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.250
Aren't I supposed to do
everything for you?

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.570
And--

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's
a great question.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's
a fantastic question.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.070
And it's one that I like to
ask people who work on my

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.650
teams as well.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.980
What do you need to
get your job done?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.970
What do you need to be happier,
to be more effective?

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.780
And I can guarantee you the next
time I met with Eric, I

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.520
had an answer.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.110
I had a whole laundry list of
things that I needed, because

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.560
I was ready for that
next time.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But that's
great in the sense that

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.390
Eric saw himself as there to
help you, not grill you on

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.945
what have you done for him
lately, kind of thing.

00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:28.330
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's
a great example of good

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.540
leadership.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.340
So the other thing we'd like
to talk about, if you're

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.530
working in this ideal company,
is that as an employee you

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.725
should pursue responsibility.

00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:40.710
And what we mean by that is
being able to leave your

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.000
comfort zone and do things that
are interesting to you

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.220
and things that you think are
best for your product, best

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.750
for your company, not
necessarily asking permission.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.220
We like to talk about seeing the
forest through the trees.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.990
Sort of novice engineers
get told what to do.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.800
They expect to get
told what to do.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.030
They do exactly what
they're told.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.850
Then they come back and they
say, more work, please.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.050
And in a great company where
you can grow, when you have

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.410
software engineers who are
growing and developing, you

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.290
have a situation where they're
actually doing more than what

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.890
is asked of them.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:10.940
They go out.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.070
They not only do what was asked
of them, but they come

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.990
back with a more general
solution or a proposal to get

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.250
something better done, right?

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.610
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's
generalization going on.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.230
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And that
should be rewarded.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.120
And that should be encouraged.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.050
An example is if you're a forest
ranger, they send you

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.605
out in the forest to cut
down the diseased tree.

00:06:26.605 --> 00:06:29.410
The novice forest ranger is
going to go in, cut down the

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.730
diseased tree, and come back
and say, I'm done sir.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.900
But the more experienced one
might come back and say, I cut

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.070
down the tree, removed all the
branches and the stump and

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.740
everything.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.090
And I found 57 other trees that
have the same disease.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.180
And they're right here
in this map.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.330
Would you like me to do
something with them, as well?

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.270
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Create a plan.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.710
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.460
It's creating a plan.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.250
And those are the kind of people
who wind up getting

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.610
more work, which is usually a
good thing if you like what

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.080
you're doing.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's
the reward for work--

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.440
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The reward
for good work is more work.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.160
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.690
As long as you like the work.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.070
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's
a good thing.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.670
No, really.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.805
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: As long as
you like the work, that's

00:06:58.805 --> 00:06:58.940
the reward.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: As long
as you like the work.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.040
But I mean, your leader's more
likely to give you more

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.520
interesting things to
do because it's

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.100
less work for them.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And
they trust you now.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:08.360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
they trust you now.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:They see
that you're thinking big.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, what
else happens in an ideal

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.510
corporation?

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you
might question things.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.420
You might, instead of just doing
what you're told, you

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.890
might actually question
something you don't think is

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.930
right or you think it's harmful
or you think there's

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.720
something better you can do.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.440
It's more of a dialogue than
someone says, hey, you should

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.160
do this, and you just
go ahead and do it.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.750
It's about not being
a doormat.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.880
It's about challenging the
status quo and trying to think

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.970
of better ways of making
things happen.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Absolutely.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.760
Part of that also is just
learning to communicate well.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.170
This is something I know
that does not come

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.680
naturally to everybody.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.765
There's that old joke about how
do you know if an engineer

00:07:45.765 --> 00:07:46.560
is outgoing?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How, Ben?

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.310
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks
at your shoes.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.565
All right.

00:07:49.565 --> 00:07:50.570
Fine.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Ooh, tough crowd.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, but
communication is critical on a

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.860
team when you're doing software
engineering because

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.250
you want to let your manager
and your teammates know.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.120
You want to know about your

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.960
victories, about your failures.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.810
You want to know what your
expectations are.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.220
What do you need, right?

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Having the
answer to that question

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.490
ready to go when somebody asks
you instead of just sitting

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.780
there with the blinders on
doing what you're told.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
obstacles, even.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.460
Like--

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:14.660
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.600
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Remember when
your team had some issues

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.160
with legal, and they were like
six weeks waiting for a

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.990
response from legal.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.040
And Ben and I were having a cup
of coffee, and it's like,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.920
oh my God, you know, this
is just killing us.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.480
This legal is not responding.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.900
And I said, why didn't
you tell me.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.470
I know these people in legal.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.330
And I got on the phone and
resolved it in about an hour

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.200
and a half.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.200
And that's not because I'm
some amazing person.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.250
It's just because I knew who to
call and talk to politely,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.080
let's shall we say.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.700
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
All because I

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.020
communicated with you.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:40.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yay
communication.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.730
So another thing that people
often forget about in big

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.230
companies is actually is that
people treat you the way that

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.500
you ask to be treated,
I guess, is the way--

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:55.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.560
If you expect somebody to
act a certain way, they

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.390
often act that way.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:58.760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.500
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.940
So, it's about getting
your work done.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.740
Nobody should be counting how
many minutes you're at your

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.150
desk when you check
in or check out.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.660
If you get your work
done, it's obvious.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.730
If you don't get your work
done, it's obvious.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So that's
what we mean by-- and it

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.630
certainly is true at Google.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.200
One of the reasons we like
working there is they treat

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.930
everybody like an adult
by default.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.090
And it's a wonderful thing.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:21.780
And that is not true of other
companies I have been in.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:21.990
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.510
Well, there was a guy that came
to work with us, and he

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.340
was on my team a number
of years ago.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.590
And he'd worked in industry
for 20 years.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.380
And it was his first day.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.060
You're a little bit,
like, overwhelmed.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.470
Quarter to 5:00, he came
up to me and said,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.900
look, I'm really sorry.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.460
I have an appointment that
I couldn't move.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.030
I've got to go.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.680
But I'll be here 15 minutes
later tomorrow.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.790
And I said, look, man, I don't
care when you come and go.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.760
As long as you put in your 80
hours a week, you'll be fine.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Fitz is just cruel.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And he looked
at me and he understood

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.820
that I was joking.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.160
But he did get the point that
he's responsible for making

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.430
things happen, and that it's not
about being in a seat at a

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.940
certain time.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.780
It's about being available to
your team to make sure that

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.550
the work gets done.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sure.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.470
You were telling me another time
when we do a conference

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.420
in Chicago every winter where
we rent out a big hall at a

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.760
university, a whole
building in fact.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.740
And one of the first times you
went there, you went there to

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.270
get the keys from the person
who runs the building.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.380
And instead of a series of
lectures about don't do this,

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.850
don't go here, blah, blah, blah,
stay out of blah, blah,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.690
blah, the guy was just like,
here's the building.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.130
Here are the keys.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.930
I'll get them from
you on Monday.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.170
See you.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.570
And like, you were telling
me that was--

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:35.050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That
was intimidating.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.550
It was really.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It was
intimidating because it's

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.880
like, wow, this person just
put so much trust in me.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.440
I better leave this place better
then I found it, right.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.030
They expect me to behave this
way, so I'm going to live up

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.690
to their expectations.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.100
I mean, if they set up
this fence and they

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.010
say, here's the fence.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.770
It's six feet tall.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.390
It's made out of concrete.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.090
Don't go any further
than that.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.550
People will often just pile
crap up against the fence

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.020
because they're like, I'm being
treated like a child and

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.870
I'm going to act like one.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:58.970
I'm a caged animal.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.270
I'm going to run around
and rattle the cage.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.550
People look for those
boundaries.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.290
But when there are no boundaries
and you're given

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.660
this responsibility, I think
it's a great responsibility.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk
about another thing is

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.920
taking risks.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.230
If you're in a company, in an
organization where you are

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.800
allowed to take risks and to
expand your comfort zone, you

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.520
can do things like fail fast.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.590
You can take more
responsibility.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.590
You can fail, document what
you've learned, adapt, and

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.620
then try again.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.490
If somebody gets upset with
failure, just explain to them

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.800
it's a way of learning
really quickly.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.300
Think about,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.500
Think about-- anybody
here have kids?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.310
You can raise your hand.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:45.650
You ever see a kid burn
themself on the stove?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.540
It's painful for the kid,
but you know what?

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.590
They learn really fast
that that's hot.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So does my cat.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And they
don't want to touch that.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.060
You can sit there and give
them a lecture on

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.730
thermodynamics and
all you want.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.030
But, man, they just stick their
hand in there and that's

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.135
the last time they're ever
going to pull that stunt.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:11:59.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.200
Also when you exercise,
that's one of the

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.770
things they talk about.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.530
If you work out at a gym,
sometimes you want to do

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.710
weights to the point where your
muscles actually start to

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.175
fail because that's the point
where you improve.

00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:12.910
If you always just do just
enough exercise so that it's

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.370
comfortable and then you
walk away, you never

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.510
really get any better.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.460
You just stay at that
level, right.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.600
If you exercise to failure, you
start to push yourself.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.990
You grow, you adapt.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Right, right.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.760
So without that risk, you
really never improve.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.150
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, those are
a few of the tips that you

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.190
can do if you're living in a
lovely garden that's well

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.320
raked like this.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.020
Unfortunately, we're aware that
most companies look a lot

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.920
more like this kind
of a garden.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.880
And most people work
for people who

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.570
look more like this.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.240
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So let's talk
a little bit about the

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.520
bad manager which is--

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.380
there's a statistic--

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.210
and remember that 75% of all
statistics are made up--

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.980
there's a statistic that 50% of
the happiness of your job

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.740
comes from your manager, whether
you're happy working

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.310
with them or working for them.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.430
And that really is true
in my experience.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.340
I've had the, I'd say,
opportunity to work for some

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.105
really great managers in my
time, not only at Google but

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:12.940
in other places.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.930
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, a
typical bad manager is someone

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.600
who essentially prevents
a lot of the things

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.930
we just talked about.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.160
They prevent you from taking
any risks at all.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.510
Failure is a terrible thing.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.920
Not even the smallest failure is
terrifying to the manager.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.500
And of course, that spills
over to you.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.580
And then you're afraid to
take any risks, as well.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.630
In addition, the manager also
thinks that you're there to

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.230
serve him or her.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.370
And again, instead of what can
I do for you, it's what have

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.730
you done for me lately.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.800
So, all the meetings you
have are sort of

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.190
you're on the defensive.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.460
You're always trying to prove
that you have a value to him

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.350
or to the company.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.725
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:50.380
How are you gonna help me climb
the ladder because I'm

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.260
the manager here.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:51.560
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.940
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And whatever
you do, I'm gonna

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.680
take credit for it.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Nasty.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Unless
you screw up, in which

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.590
case that's all you.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:59.800
And that's unfortunately
how it works.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.020
And this is something that most
people don't talk about,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.830
but everyone's aware of on the
team, is that the bad manager

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.730
will ignore people like this,
low performers on the team.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.830
And that is one of the
worst things that a

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.790
bad manager can do.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, it's
a huge drag on the team.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.525
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, it
destroys the team's morale.

00:14:15.525 --> 00:14:15.940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.490
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It causes
you to lose your best

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.060
performers.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.230
But, I mean, you've got six good
guys on your team and one

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:22.770
person like this.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.035
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And pretty
soon, your best people

00:14:24.035 --> 00:14:25.790
on the team start to leave--

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:27.000
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they
get tired of dragging

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.830
this person along.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.740
So a good manager's someone
who's really going to take

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.950
care of low performers.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.120
So this is some of the things
that a bad manager might do.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Other characters.

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Others
characters.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.510
Another important person to be
very wary of is the office

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.290
politician.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:44.980
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
He's awesome.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is
a very friendly person.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:48.790
They're usually very great
at managing up.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.280
And this isn't necessarily
a manager.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.370
This might be another engineer
on your team.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.500
They're very quick to
take credit for

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.780
something that happens.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.180
They're also very quick
to assign blame.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.120
But they put a lot of energy
into looking impactful, but

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.410
not being impactful.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Perception
is 9/10 of the law.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:05.440
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.730
Perception is 9/10 of the law.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:07.830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And
they understand that.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.660
And they do everything to make
their perception as important

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:11.660
as possible.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.100
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the thing
that most engineers will

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.380
do when they encounter someone
like this is they'll just go

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.820
heads down and ignore them
and say, I'm going

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.630
to write great code.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.610
I'm going to have
a great product.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:21.650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Engineers
hate politics.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: 'Cause I
don't like the politics, and I

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.660
don't want to deal
with this person.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.320
But that's very dangerous
because if you're not careful,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.540
this person can wind up getting
promoted and being

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.750
your manager.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.690
We've seen that happen, too.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.420
So they're someone
to steer around.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:40.140
But it's another example of
why even if you don't like

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.040
dealing with the promotion
process or stuff like that,

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.650
it's important to pay attention
to that sort of

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.640
thing because it's
a way of getting

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.230
yourself in a safe place.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.740
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You
don't want to get run

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.643
over by this person.

00:15:49.643 --> 00:15:50.530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Right, exactly.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.330
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: If
you're passive, that

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.630
can happen very easily.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.670
Let's talk about the
organization itself now, not

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.180
just the people you run into.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.650
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There
are many types of bad

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.980
organizations out there.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This
is one, for example.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.780
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And what
are the stereotypes we all

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:07.160
know about?

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.560
What makes a corporation
hostile to employees?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.020
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Hey, Ben.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.860
I'd like you to finish that
product by Thursday.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:13.220
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Awesome.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And I want
you to also test it.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.940
I want you to QA it, push
it into production.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.710
And, oh, I have a new feature
I'd like to add in as well.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Didn't you
just take somebody away

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.350
from my team?

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.730
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.510
But you should be skydiving in
with the product tomorrow--

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:24.775
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Excellent.

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:25.380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --as well.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
No problem.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.030
So, right.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And don't
forget about the

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.630
bike and the rappeling.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Impossible.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.100
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, yeah,
impossible schedules,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.610
impossible expectations, not
enough resources to get done

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.620
what they're asking you to do.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And when
talking about resources, we

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.540
mean like--

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:40.920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: People.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --computing
resources, not people.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.800
People are not resources.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.260
They're people.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
You don't like it

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.640
when people call them--

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I don't like
it when people call--

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.140
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How
many resources do you

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.380
have on your team?

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.420
That's a pet peeve.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But we've all
seen companies where you

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.430
can spend $3,000 on hardware and
save hundreds of engineer

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.140
hours, but companies don't do
that because you're already

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.420
there and you're going on.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.990
That's a capital expenditure.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:05.970
You're just a payroll
expenditure, and--

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:06.410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.500
They don't do the math with
the big [? scheme. ?]

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:07.900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.569
So that's definitely something
to be wary about.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So,
something else that big

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.470
corporations tend to do is they
simply don't trust you.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.280
We talked about trust
earlier, right.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.990
They treat you like
a caged animal.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.280
They treat you like
a naughty child.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.470
They just see you as
replaceable, expendable.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.940
And in the worst case,
they just see you

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.319
as a cog in a machine.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.350
This person is here to
do x units of work

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.970
in y amount of time.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.660
And turn the key, it should
all just work.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.770
And we're not doing an assembly
line here, right.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.060
This is a creative job that
requires a creative

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.900
environment and a lot of social
skills to survive.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.130
It's not just line up
replaceable parts

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.020
and turn the knob.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And there's
a lot of different

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.410
technological ways that
this happens.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.410
You get time cards where you
punch in and you punch out.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.450
Or you're caged by your IT
department in so far as we're

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:59.110
gonna set up a big firewall and
prevent you from going to

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.870
any website that might
distract you

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.840
or waste your time.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.850
And we see companies do
this all the time.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.740
Or we're gonna prevent people
from checking their personal

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:08.500
mail or from using instant
messenger, all

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.110
that sort of thing.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Just
like a naughty child.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.590
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Exactly,
just like a naughty child.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.450
And we're gonna measure your
productivity in great ways,

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.980
like lines of code.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.560
See how many many lines of
code you wrote today.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.150
That is a great way to encourage
people to write lots

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.400
of lines of code, of
crappy code, right.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: More
code is always better.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:22.950
I don't know what you're
talking about.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I'd like to
rate people on how much code

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.620
they delete myself.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.070
But--

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's true.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.950
Yeah, hard metric.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so beyond
this, things start to

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.900
get a little fuzzier.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.220
Some companies suffer from
this complete chaos of

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.160
direction where there's
too many leaders

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.150
without a central vision.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.530
You might have seven different
bosses giving contradictory

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.250
directions.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.790
What was it, the quote
from Office Space?

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.420
Bob.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.610
I have seven bosses or eight
bosses, or whatever it was.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.040
But another characteristic of
this organization is one

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.360
that's obsessed with titles and
hierarchy and political

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.740
power struggles.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.880
And I have you on my team and
your miserable and you really

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.830
want to work on that team, but
I'm not letting go of you

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.980
because if you leave, I
can't get anyone else.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.570
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's just
that the amount of distraction

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.450
is huge too, right.

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.070
Even if you put forth Herculean
effort to achieve

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.190
these impossible goals, if
different bosses are moving

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.660
the goalposts around all the
time depending where you talk,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.760
it's just infuriating.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.210
It just drives you insane.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.580
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to some
extent, this exists in even

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.360
companies that are well
organized and high

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.710
functioning.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.480
Years ago when I first became a
manager at Google, I was in

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.735
my happy little [? world, ?]
writing code and shipping code

00:19:32.735 --> 00:19:34.460
and moving things
in production.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.640
Everything seemed pretty
straightforward to me.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.140
I knew where we're going.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.250
And then I became a manager, and
I was talking to all these

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.820
other higher ups.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.490
And suddenly there's all
these different things.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.240
We should do this.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.450
Maybe we should do that.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.102
And I went and talked to the
guy who had previously been

00:19:46.102 --> 00:19:47.650
manager and I said,
the company's gone

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.140
crazy all of a sudden.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:49.790
What happened?

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.110
I'm like, we were all going
this way and now it's

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.240
like all like this.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.800
And he's like, it's been
like this forever.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.010
He's like, I've just been hiding
all that crap from you

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.550
because it's--

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Really
good manager.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --it's
a distraction.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.770
And I'm like, wow, you weren't
as bad as I thought you were.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.638
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No.

00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:06.040
Yeah.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.690
But that's the sign of a great
leader or manager, protects

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.610
the reports from that chaos so
they can get their work done.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's
fantastic when it happens.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's
also the sign of a

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.470
great cleaning person.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.235
You only notice it when
they're gone.

00:20:17.235 --> 00:20:18.480
Like, this place is a dump.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.050
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well,
let's talk about how we

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.140
actually get things done in a
dysfunctional organization or

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.380
even just a large
organization.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.290
The amount of dysfunction varies
from place to place.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.770
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This is how
you're gonna survive in a

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.480
particularly toxic
environment.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Here
is the magic question.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:32.930
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: The
magic question.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the
first thing we like to talk

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.440
about-- and this is something
you'll actually

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.370
hear a lot at Google.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.290
It's attributed to various
famous folks.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:38.340
I forgot--

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No,
it's attributed to

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.130
Grace Hopper, I believe.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yes, yes.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And if
anyone hasn't seen Grace

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.550
Hopper's talk on nanoseconds,
go check it out.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.640
It's on the internet.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.560
We're big fans of
the internet.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, the
trick here is this is about

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.230
risk taking, but a particular
kind of risk taking.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.540
It's know how far you can go
without seriously jeopardizing

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.930
your career, the risk
of getting fired.

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:04.810
But you will discover
it's amazing.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.770
If you know something needs to
be done, you know what the

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.210
right thing is to do, and you
go in there and you start

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.230
asking your seven bosses,
can I do this?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.790
Can I do this?

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.120
Every time you ask someone is
an invitation to say no.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.320
And that's the default answer,
right, especially in an

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.600
organization where people are
afraid of failure or risk.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:21.935
So--

00:21:21.935 --> 00:21:23.820
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And the
reason a lot of people ask

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.070
permission is because you're
relieving yourself of

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.540
responsibility.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.990
I could be, look, I
asked the Bobs.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.570
They said it was OK,
or they said no.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.810
So, the Bobs are preventing me
from getting stuff done.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It's scary
to take responsibility

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:35.480
when you're doing a risk.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.120
But often that's the only way
to get anything done.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.890
So act first, apologize later.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.330
That's the other way I've
heard this phrase.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.080
And don't do anything
that you can't undo.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.680
That's sort of the rule
of thumb, I suppose.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.300
And be prepared to back up your
decision if someone does

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.210
come to you and say, why on
Earth did you do this?

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.600
And if it fails, try
again, right.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.900
But at least you're getting
something way more done than

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.230
the folks who are scared or
folks who are just asking

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.250
permission, being turned
down all the time.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.260
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can
usually choose the action or

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.410
the consequences,
but not both.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:07.940
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
I like this.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.660
Yes.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK, so--

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.690
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Give an example.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:11.250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
An example is--

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You control
either the action or

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:13.680
the consequence of the action.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:13.870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.210
So I can launch a product, but I
don't know how it's going to

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.240
come out necessarily.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.640
Or I cannot launch a product,
and I know that nothing bad's

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.890
gonna happen.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.560
You'll see this a lot in
family situations.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.760
I'm gonna say something to my
family because gosh darn it,

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.250
I'm gonna show them that this
is the way it's gonna be.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: But then
you can't control the result.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can't
control the way that they're

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:35.230
gonna act or the way that
they're gonna behave.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.040
So--

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
But, let's say the

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.460
other side is I want--

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can
change your actions to achieve

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.550
a particular consequence.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: The result
is that I want my uncle

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.050
to be happy--

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That would
be something different.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.640
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --I have
to work backwards and do an

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.540
action that I know is
gonna cause that.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:46.900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And that's

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.890
definitely the case in companies.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.080
And it's not a rational thing.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.490
Some people would say, well,
I'm gonna act this way, and

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:54.730
you should act this way.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.540
If you ever hear yourself
saying to someone, well,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.460
so-and-so should do something,
you should

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.650
just stop right there.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.810
Should is a magic word that
shows up in your head that

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.720
means that you are trying
to control the future.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.560
And it's really difficult unless
you're Batman or Sergey

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.120
Brin, or both.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.200
I don't know.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.110
So, not saying anything.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I've never
seen them together.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I've never
seen them together either.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.290
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
It's very strange.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So let's
talk about choosing battles.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.730
This is something that
comes up a lot.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.210
There's usually folks in your
organization or on your team

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.740
who are very opinionated.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.060
Nothing wrong with that.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.040
Problem is they don't always
know which fights to choose.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.730
And that is a hard lesson
to learn for some folks.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.410
They put so much energy into
being so passionate about

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.460
everything that they end up
getting almost nothing done

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.250
because they're not choosing
their battles.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:46.300
And it tends to drag down the
momentum of the team.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.310
It tends to drag down momentum
of the leader of the team,

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.880
having to defend and deal with
everything that's happening.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.880
So, you need to know not only
just which battles to choose.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.330
You need to understand what
kind of political capital

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.100
you're spending to win
a certain battle.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:02.840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Is it worth it?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.810
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Is it worth it?

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.020
Are you gonna spend all your
capital over here or are you

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:06.780
gonna spend it over here?

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.530
Because once you've used it
up-- you've called in your

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.440
favors, you've done whatever--

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.200
you can't just turn around and
have another screaming battle

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.050
the next day on a different
subject.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.750
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because if
you think of it as a train and

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.890
you're trying to stop every
engineer that comes by every

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.270
15 minutes in the train,
eventually they're just gonna

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:22.630
run you right over.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:23.860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
lose their patience.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They
lose their patience.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.800
But also remember that every
time people hit the brakes,

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.990
you're slowing down the progress
of the product.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.170
So that's something that you
really got to be careful and

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:33.420
think about, is it worth it?

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:38.160
If you're gonna beg forgiveness
rather than ask

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.850
permission, make sure it's
for the right thing.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.180
You don't want to spend all
your political capital in

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.110
making t-shirts or something.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.810
You'd be better to spend it
on launching a product--

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now
sometimes you have a really

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.280
great idea but you're not sure
how to communicate it upwards

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.250
in the organization or laterally
to other teams.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.340
And you'll fight a battle, and
you'll scream about it.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.950
And it turns out sometimes the
best way to get your idea out

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.780
there is not to make a giant
stink about it, but instead to

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.580
do the subtle, subliminal way of
moving the message around.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.300
So it turns out that your ideas
can go really, really

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.570
far in a company--

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:13.970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really far.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if you
don't take the credit for it,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.170
or if you just don't care
whether you get

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:18.370
credit for the idea.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.710
So it can be something as
simple, at the grassroots

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.460
level, just sort of whispering
this idea to certain friends

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.080
or to certain people
on another team

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.100
at the lunch table.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.410
Or mention it in passing when
a VP is walking by.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.580
And maybe he'll overhear.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.500
It's an art form in
itself, but it's

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.420
actually pretty powerful.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.600
We've seen this happen,
right, where an idea--

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.090
and by the time maybe somebody
at the top who is a decision

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.940
maker hears the idea formally
presented, there's been so

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:47.280
much buzz about it already in
the company that it doesn't

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.040
seem like such a crazy idea.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.350
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And you can
actively use this if you're

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.680
trying to change someone's mind
in your organization, is

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.930
tell people that you know who
trust you that they trust and

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.180
ask them to mention the
idea to that person.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.510
And if they hear it from
[INAUDIBLE], even if they know

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.300
what's going on, if they keep
hearing this over and over

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.670
again, they're gonna
be like, hey.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.550
And next thing you know, you
hear it coming out of some

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.160
vice president's mouth at a
press conference or something.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.780
And your response can be,
hey, that's my idea.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.460
Or you can be like, hey,
that's my idea.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.080
That's pretty awesome.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:16.410
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:16.720
Yeah.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.450
What's more important?

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.215
That it happens or that
you get the credit?

00:26:19.215 --> 00:26:19.680
Sometimes you have to choose.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.550
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You're
choosing, right.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.360
You have to choose sometimes.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.170
So, let's talk about habits.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.990
Anyone here has ever attempted
to quit something, like quit

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.310
smoking, quit drinking?

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.920
Some people I know--

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Caffeine.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --have
to quit eating.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:34.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Have
to quit eating.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.600
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But bad
habits, or systems, really

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.080
can't be destroyed.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.560
But we found that they can be
replaced by a new habit.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.180
OK.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.070
You have a great example of this
you did with one of the

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.005
teams you work with.

00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:45.280
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.750
We had--

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.640
one of the teams I took over, at
least for awhile, had this

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.490
standing meeting.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.850
I know it was Agile Scrum
something something something.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:54.325
But--

00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:55.860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
It was Agile--

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Oh, OK.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.085
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--at one point.

00:26:57.085 --> 00:26:57.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.280
I'm not trained in those
magic techniques.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.970
But it was every morning.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.535
We're gonna all stand here for
20 minutes or whatever and go

00:27:03.535 --> 00:27:04.910
around in a circle,
blah, blah, blah.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:06.980
And people were kind of
frustrated with it, but they

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.310
were just doing it
out of habit.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, but it
turned into an hour, right?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:09.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Got worse.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There was
sitting down, and it was like

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.180
group therapy.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.650
Well, you know, I went out--

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:13.850
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Not so efficient.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--last night.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You know, I
don't have anything really to

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.080
say but I want to talk about
Rails, you know.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.460
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
But the thing is--

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:21.790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Ow.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:22.370
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's cool.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.890
It's cool.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Oh, oh, stop.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.770
But the point is it wasn't a
totally useless meeting.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:29.210
There were some nuggets of

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:30.860
communication going on in there.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.170
So it would not have been,
probably, that smart to just

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.090
be like, this is stupid.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.060
Kill this meeting forever.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.200
Go away.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.600
Instead, we just replaced it.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.580
We said, all right, let's
instead have just an email

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:41.930
thread that goes out
every morning.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.890
You have a cron job that just
sends an email saying, hey,

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.930
what's going on?

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.980
What did you do yesterday?

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.600
What are you blocked on today?

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.470
Everybody reply to this
thread, right.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.810
Everybody spends 30
seconds replying.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:53.380
You're done.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.510
People can read the thread
whenever they want.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.610
So much more efficient.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.110
Gets the exact same sort
of thing done.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.990
And it sparks off side
conversations, which is all

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.070
that matters.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.620
That's we wanted.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.040
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But there's
one sneaky thing you did as

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.890
well in that, is that-- and this
is a sneaky technique for

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.380
introducing anything new
or changing anything--

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.780
is three magic words,
let's try this.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.960
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
We can always undo.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.710
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's
try this for 30 days.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.950
Let's try this for two weeks.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:18.620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.825
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If it doesn't
work, everybody hates

00:28:19.825 --> 00:28:21.000
it, we'll go back.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.560
And oftentimes, people are like,
oh my God, I mean, it's

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.210
not permanent.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:27.670
We can actually just try
something for 30 days.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:27.920
OK.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.790
And then after three weeks,
they're like, oh,

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.080
it wasn't so bad.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:31.270
This isn't so--

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.935
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or they
just forget it was a trial and

00:28:32.935 --> 00:28:33.650
just do it forever.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:39.130
That's usually what happens
if it goes well.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.090
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And beyond
that, let's talk about-- back

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.305
to the organization
and moving around.

00:28:44.305 --> 00:28:46.580
This is something that most
engineers we know-- and it's

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.390
often been abhorrent to
us, I think, as well--

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.850
is the ladder of a company.

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:53.130
OK.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.480
We talked earlier about the
office politician who's always

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.660
sort of working it, trying
to go up the ladder.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.780
And most of these bad
companies, bad

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.520
organizations, have--

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.590
there's a mismatch between doing
the right thing for the

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.380
company and doing the right
thing to promoted.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:08.780
OK.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.030
So you have to make a choice.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.430
And it doesn't have to
be black or white.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.930
It can be a little bit
of a gray blend.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.440
You can do a little
bit of both.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.690
But it's dangerous if you choose
to always do the right

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.700
thing and ignore
being promoted.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.540
OK.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.540
So, as we mentioned earlier, you
should climb this ladder

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.820
until you get to a safe place.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.200
And so, it is worthwhile to
spend energy on that.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.060
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This
works particularly in

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.070
companies that are very power
driven, that where hierarchy

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.000
and title is right at the
forefront of everybody's mind.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.500
That if you can get yourself
up to a high title, then

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.200
people will leave you alone
because you've got power,

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.240
right, or some imaginary
title that tells people

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.230
to leave you alone.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.850
Just working the
system, right?

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.510
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:48.420
It's your bubble.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.550
It's your safe haven.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.530
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now a
companion to that idea is not

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.700
only can you work up the ladder
to the point where

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.380
nobody can tell you what to do,
you can go find some place

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.250
in the company to hide.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.180
It sounds crazy, but
there are projects

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.430
that don't get bothered.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.540
There are teams that have so
much credibility that no one

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.080
will question or bug you, or
just give you a bunch of

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.040
freedom that you might
not have otherwise.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.660
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: There's often
an executive who values

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.220
what you're doing, as well, more
than some other executive

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.210
that might be in a different
part of the company.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:17.280
So moving to a different
department or different team

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.300
or something is often a good
way of being safe when the

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.320
nuclear war comes.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Sometimes
you have to do this every

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.480
couple years as the company
changes if you

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.300
want to stay happy.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Some of us
have been in companies that

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.680
every fifth Thursday
is layoff Thursday.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.200
I worked at a company years ago
that I will not name and

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.755
nobody answered the
phone on Thursday.

00:30:39.425 --> 00:30:42.480
And if your boss showed up in
your office all a sudden, it

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.710
was just panic time.

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.760
But--

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Talk
about perception.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Perception, yeah.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.570
Upward perception.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.620
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: This
is a tricky thing.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.730
We said earlier that perception
is 9/10 of the law.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:56.190
And so what that really means
is being aware not just of

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.340
getting stuff done and doing the
right thing, but always be

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.690
thinking in the back of your
head, how does this look to

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.190
people not on my team or
people above my level?

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.930
What are they perceiving, right,
because that is at

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.210
least as important as what
you're actually doing.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.290
The office politician
knows this.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.260
And you need to at least--

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.290
maybe you don't need to
manipulate people the way the

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.140
office politician does, but at
least you need to be aware of

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.840
it and make sure it is not
misrepresenting what you're

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.590
actually doing.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.860
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.830
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, you
want to launch things as much

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.080
as possible because that creates
a great perception.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.510
You want to under-promise.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.110
You want to over-deliver.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.100
These are all things
we strive for.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.960
And I personally, I had problems
with this when I

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.580
first became a manager,
a leader.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.160
My team had the project
[INAUDIBLE], we had a huge

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.960
amount of technical debt, and
it was just crushing us.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.630
So the first thing I said was,
all right guys, I'm the new

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.470
leader here.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.360
We really need to hunker down
and spend the next six or nine

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.950
months just focusing on our
technical debt so that we can

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.990
be free of these shackles
and then move on.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:53.190
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
your director said--

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:53.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Great idea.

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:53.880
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
The director was

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.570
like, that's great.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:54.940
We love it.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.980
You should totally do that.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.980
Of course, he was completely
wrong.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.650
He didn't actually--

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.400
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
He wasn't lying.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.540
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, he
didn't-- he thought it was a

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:00.560
great idea--

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.020
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He thought
it was a great idea.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.920
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
--intellectually.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.060
The problem isn't-- this is
something I've come to think

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.400
about later-- is that I have
this idea in my head now what

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.760
we call offensive versus
defensive work.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.590
Offensive work is work that is
very visible to outsiders,

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:16.490
like, write a new shiny feature,
make this product

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.020
faster, anything that's going
to be impressive to people

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.850
outside your team.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.570
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
A lot faster.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.950
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Really visible.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.850
Defensive work is just as
important as offensive work.

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.350
It's all the invisible
work, right.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.590
Oh, we're gonna maintain
the product.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:30.000
We're gonna migrate
the database.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Refactor--

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We're
gonna refactor code--

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:31.920
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --code.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.320
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --so
it's more maintainable.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.510
We're gonna make our monitoring
of our systems more

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.360
robust so we have
better uptime.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.250
That's all stuff that's
completely thankless when your

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.200
management looks down.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.040
It looks like you're
doing nothing.

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.710
And that was a huge slap in my
face because after six months

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:47.880
my director was like,
why aren't

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.930
you guys doing anything.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.080
I'm like, oh, look,
we did all this.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.140
We're doing so much work.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.270
And like, it looks like you're
doing nothing to me.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.090
And he was annoyed.

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Looks like
you're fixing crap that you

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.140
broke in the first place.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:56.600
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Yeah, right.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.840
So--

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.850
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.330
Why didn't you write it
right the first time?

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:00.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's
no sympathy.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:04.420
There's no-- so that's the sad
politics there is that even

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.900
though defensive work is just
as important as offensive

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.680
work, you cannot spend all your
time on defensive work.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And to be
clear, this isn't a malicious

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:12.660
attitude that people have.

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.660
It's just the--

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.170
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Human psyche.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:14.680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --perception

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.160
is 9/10 of the law.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.650
And that's absolutely
the way it is.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:19.870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So we
have a rule for now where

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.070
about usually--

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.260
never spend more than about a
third of your time and energy

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.030
as a team on defensive work.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.480
Because if you do more than
that, then people just think

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.580
you're holding still.

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:30.820
And--

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:31.980
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you do
less than that, your product

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.113
falls over.

00:33:33.113 --> 00:33:34.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.040
But it's a tricky
balance to find.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.435
But you have to stay
aware of that.

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:39.810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, next
we want to talk about--

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.530
I want to make you an offer
that you can't refuse.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:46.150
Think of the movie
The Godfather.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:50.270
There's a favor economy, that
isn't necessarily done, and

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.950
there's not cash.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.520
It's like someone asks you to
do something that you can

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.930
easily do--

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.320
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Or you
could easily say no.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: You can
easily say no, but it's

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.010
typically gonna be easier for
you to do it, or make it

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.040
happen, than for them.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.590
And, it's very much in your
best interest, most of the

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.440
time, to do that for someone.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:07.990
Now, I'm not--

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.949
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Not
in the short term.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Not in the
short term, because it can

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.250
take a little bit
of your time.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.040
And I'm not saying that you
should be a doormat or let

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.460
anyone walk over you or someone
continue to take

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.820
advantage of you.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.570
But look for opportunities
to help.

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.630
And these are the kind of
thing-- it's like making small

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.370
bets, where there's no
real house edge here.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.590
You make a small bet
and some of them,

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.360
you're just gonna lose.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.480
A buck, it's gone.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.070
Buck, it's gone.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.179
But every once in awhile, you're
gonna win the lottery,

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:32.940
and it's gonna come back and
pay you back in spades.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.010
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So when
we talk about building up

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:37.010
trust, making these small
favors, you're building up

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.790
karma and trust that will
come back eventually.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.219
There was a great quote somebody
gave when we talked

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.420
about this idea with them.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:50.800
The quote was, friends come and
go but enemies accumulate.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.250
It's a great thing because
basically it's saying don't

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.150
burn bridges.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.110
That's the corollary to this
theme is that it will destroy

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.550
your karma and trust in this
favor economy if you leave and

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.250
burn a bridge.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
And sometimes you

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.520
get very quick return.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.090
I mean like the recruiting team
called us up and they

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.080
said, hey, you guys are
those two nerds with

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.770
the lab coats, right?

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:12.600
We want to do some videos
where people can talk to

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.550
engineers--

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.430
ask questions of Google
engineers.

00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:17.275
Would you guys mind taking
some time to do a video?

00:35:17.275 --> 00:35:17.580
Now--

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We
could have said no.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.305
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Could
have said no.

00:35:19.305 --> 00:35:22.400
It is a half hour, 45 minutes
out of our day.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.620
And we said, oh, sure.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.200
Yeah, we'll do that.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.930
So we did this video for them.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.730
And they were super glad to
throw some extra recruiting

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:33.330
resources to help us find some
people for our teams.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.710
Because now they know us.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.460
Anyone in recruiting's
like, hey, you guys.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.150
Your [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.760
been such a huge help.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.930
And it's actually been a bigger
bet because other

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.650
recruiters worldwide are using
this video to, well, to

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:45.450
recruit more people.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.090
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We get to
do fun things like interviews

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:50.950
at IO for the live stream
because of what we started

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.190
because of small favors.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.300
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Those are just--

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:52.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Fun stuff.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --some
really visible examples.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.050
But it extends to absolutely
everything.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.390
There's a book called
The Luck Factor.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.520
Anyone heard of it?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.160
The guy did a test.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.290
He put an ad out, and he said,
are you lucky or unlucky?

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.395
Please come take a
small survey--

00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:08.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Who responds--

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.005
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--a small test--

00:36:09.005 --> 00:36:09.730
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --to
an ad like that?

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:09.980
Sorry.

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:10.380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.220
Do you consider yourself
lucky or unlucky?

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.110
Please take this--

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.090
I guess it's people who
don't have a job.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.750
I don't know.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.520
So you had all these people
come in who said that.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.710
And he said, are you
lucky or unlucky?

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:21.060
And they'd say I'm
lucky or not.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.410
And then he'd say, here's the
front page of a newspaper.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:24.200
I'd like you to read this.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.990
I'm gonna time you.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.000
And we're gonna see how fast you
can count all the pictures

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.690
in the front section
of the newspaper.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.180
Ready?

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.250
Go.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.150
And now the average person who
considered themselves unlucky

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.990
took about two minutes
and 16 seconds to

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.770
find all the pictures.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.750
The average lucky person took
less than four seconds to find

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.600
all the pictures.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: How
is that possible?

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:46.160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
That's possible.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.330
In the middle of the third
page in 144 point type it

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.390
said, there are 42 pictures
in this section.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.370
OK.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.390
Unlucky people were very focused
on exactly the task at

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.270
hand and nothing else.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.220
The lucky people were the people
who maybe looked a

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.280
little bit outside.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.610
And so the point of this book
is that you can actually

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.580
manufacture luck for yourself.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.760
And the favor economy
in a company is a

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.920
way of making luck.

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.670
And so we're big fans of that.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.490
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Love it.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:16.130
So, it also helps, sort of
following in this theme of

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.730
favor economies, finding
influential friends.

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.250
And what we mean by that is
there's certain categories of

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.120
people within a company
who are very

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.500
useful allies to have.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.180
We'll talk about them.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I mean,
sometimes it's useful years

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.950
and years later, right?

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.340
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.760
It turns out I ended up managing
my former TA in

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.210
college, became my report.

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.050
It was very strange.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:37.000
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's a good
thing he was nice to you--

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:37.870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
He was very nice--

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--in college.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:38.420
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
--to me, right.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:41.610
But again, that's all about
don't burn bridges because you

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:41.990
never know.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.480
The person who you have a fight
with now may be your

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.680
manager in the next company.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Especially
in the--

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:46.610
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So you don't know.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:46.810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--tech world.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.360
The tech world is super,
super way smaller than

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.160
you think of it.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:50.800
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Surprisingly small.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.210
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Our friend
Carl likes to say there's only

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.190
about 3,000 people in
the tech world.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.240
Everyone else is local color.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.700
So let's think about that next
time you quit your job and

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.350
want to go out in a blaze of
glory and tell everybody

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.330
exactly what you think
about them.

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:03.210
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Jump off the plane.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.740
Go down the chute, right.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:04.910
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.700
Take your beer and hit
the chute, right.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.300
So the first kind of person
is a connector.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.850
These are people who, basically,
one of their

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:17.000
part-time jobs is connecting
you with other people.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.030
If you need to get a hold of
somebody in the company, you

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.900
don't know where to go, they're
the person you're

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.020
gonna say, hey, you have
any [? tips? ?]

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.340
They'll be like, yep,
talk to Megan--

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Human routers.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:24.280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--talk to Steve.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:24.810
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:26.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They are
literally human routers.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're
very well connected.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Beyond the
connectors, find people who

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.260
have influence within
the company.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.720
We happen to be lucky to have
Vint Cerf, who discovers

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:36.780
wonderful things like
the internet.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.390
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Also,
they aren't necessarily

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.420
celebrities either.

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.200
So they could just be someone
who's been at the company for

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.170
20 years, a real old timer, may
not be in a great position

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.320
of power, but, boy, they know
how the company works.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.710
They know who everybody is.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:53.000
And they are sort of secretly
able to influence things just

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:53.530
behind the scenes.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: With
very subtle movements.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:55.520
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:55.880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: RIght.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Good ways
to whisper those ideas that

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.450
you don't want to take credit
for necessarily.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.120
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, I'd like
to stop for second and

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.330
give you all a word
of warning.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.784
Do not screw with administrative
assistants.

00:39:07.784 --> 00:39:10.180
OK?

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.070
You might think it's just some
guy or woman or whatever at a

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:16.490
typewriter and typing
stuff up, all right.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.130
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
They look harmless.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They
look harmless, but

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.596
they will cut you.

00:39:20.596 --> 00:39:21.030
OK.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
If you cross them.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.620
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: If you cross
this person, she will

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.630
ruin your life.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.270
OK.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.580
Administrative assistants--

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.620
and I'm not saying that-- again,
we're not talking about

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.220
manipulating--

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.050
we're talking about
manipulating.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.110
We're not talking about being
like that office politician.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.920
We're just talking about a
little bit of yes time, a

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.380
little bit of politeness.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.940
It goes a long way.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.270
It really does.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.655
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: There's
an immense amount of power

00:39:40.655 --> 00:39:41.170
that flows--

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.990
I mean, there's like the
official org chart.

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.650
Then there's the real
chart of power.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:47.260
And administrative assistants
are right in there, way more

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.270
powerful than you think.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:49.540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, a good
administrative assistant

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:53.210
will wield their executive's
power and--

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.070
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
As a proxy.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:55.430
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Sometimes for
good, sometimes for bad.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.940
But, yeah.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.520
So you don't want to be on
the wrong side of that.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.030
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Great.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:02.110
So, the other thing, just
talking just about in terms of

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.150
communicating with people, a
lot of people love to do

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.760
electronic communication.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.780
You're gonna do email.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.110
You're gonna do chat rooms.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:09.770
You're gonna do instant
messages.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:11.080
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
Hangouts on air--

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Hang [? outside ?]

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.400
[? air. ?]

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.510
Face time is a huge deal.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:18.000
The mere act of getting on a
plane and flying to the other

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.600
branch of your company, or just
driving to wherever the

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.670
other office is--

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:25.070
being in somebody's face has a
massive impact, not just on

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.020
the ability to get things done,
just in the connection

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.650
you make with that person.

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.150
10 minutes in the face of an
executive, or whoever, is

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.160
gonna have a much more memorable
connection to that

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.130
person than 20 emails you
have over two weeks.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.840
It's not the same.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:40.450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I learned
this lesson.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.900
I've known this for years, but I
decided to take a shortcut a

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:45.540
few months ago.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.380
I had a meeting with a senior
vice president.

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.320
It's a 15 minute meeting.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.870
I wasn't gonna fly
out to Mountain

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.260
View for that or anything.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:55.960
And we had a global outage of
our video conferencing system.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.700
And so then I backed off to
Google Voice, which was out.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.932
So, I'm in my cell phone,
kneeling down in the corner of

00:41:01.932 --> 00:41:03.950
our building trying to get a
signal with my one hand in my

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.060
ear and my phone up
against my head.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.090
And they can't hear.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.210
They heard every third word.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.100
So, that's a very
extreme example.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.550
But being there, being there
face-to-face, in person, is

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:21.000
not only more helpful in the
room, but where it helps is

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.410
coming into the room and going
out of the room You've got

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.730
little more time.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:25.780
Hey, how was your weekend?

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:26.290
What did you do?

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.080
What's going on?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.200
You wind up with chance
encounters in the hallway.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.170
You might walk to the next
meeting with this person, get

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.040
a few extra minutes.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.060
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's another
reason why we talk

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.970
about how it's so important
for teams

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.760
to have lunch together.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.560
We give tours of our
office in Chicago.

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.050
And we show them the
cafe where you get

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.050
free lunch for Google.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:46.150
And a lot of people will say,
I don't know how Google can

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.060
afford this?

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.590
And the answer is, how can
Google not afford this.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.405
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Return
on investment.

00:41:50.405 --> 00:41:51.270
It's so great.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:53.790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's huge
to get your teams--

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.610
even if they're not talking
about your product-- get

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:56.850
people together for lunch.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.620
Get them to understand that
they're working with other

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.180
human beings that have lives,
that have wives

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.665
and children, perhaps.

00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:04.180
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Absolutely.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:06.440
Sometimes when you're trying to
do electronic communication

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.040
with people, they
don't respond or

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.810
they're too busy, right.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.190
It's amazing when you just
pop your face over

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.930
at their desk or--

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.450
this is crazy.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:16.450
Sometimes we pick up the phone,
and we call their desk.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:18.330
And they jump because they're
like, what's that thing

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:19.220
ringing on my desk.

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.740
I forgot it was there.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.970
What is that for?

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: How many
engineers hate the phone?

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.600
I don't even have a phone
on my desk anymore.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.540
It rings through Gmail,
which is kind of cool.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.140
But even when that rings,
I'm like what is that?

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.820
I prefer the asynchronous
communication.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.220
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So,
there is a trick.

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:39.220
Sometimes you need to
communicate with executives.

00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.320
Something's important enough
that you actually need to get

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.750
in front of them and ask
them for something.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.180
And there is an anti-pattern and
there's a pattern here we

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.380
want to promote.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.490
The anti-pattern is to--

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.860
maybe you're not right in
front of their face.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.960
Maybe you just want
to send an email.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.350
And the anti-pattern is you go
in and you write this long

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:58.280
rant, this tirade about
something's

00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:58.990
wrong, blah, blah, blah.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:59.280
This is wrong.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.510
Then I did this and this--

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:02.550
And it's 15 paragraphs long--

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:03.390
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
No line breaks.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.250
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
No line---

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:05.920
and all sorts of--

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because
this is your chance.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All sorts
of questions in there,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.580
embedded in there, right.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.445
And what does an executive
do when they get

00:43:11.445 --> 00:43:12.150
an email like that?

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.500
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Delete.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:12.790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.190
Now why do they do that?

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.760
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Because they
just don't have time to

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:16.300
understand it.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.990
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.480
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A busy
executive gets about 10

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.370
seconds to go through email.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.900
If any of you have ever seen an
exec's inbox, it looks like

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:28.650
a distributed denial
of service.

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:31.625
Because the emails just come,
and they come from everywhere.

00:43:31.625 --> 00:43:32.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:34.380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And so, you
get about 10 seconds of their

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.770
time before they timeout.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.180
So if they get 10 seconds into
your first paragraph and

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.000
you're on bullet point one of
612 and they can't figure out

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.625
the point, they're just
gonna delete it.

00:43:43.625 --> 00:43:45.870
I wish I could help this guy,
just don't have time.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:49.570
And people, like Ben said, will
usually rant forever.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So, we have
a technique that we think

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:52.670
works pretty well, has
worked for us.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.620
We call it the three bullets
and a call to action.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:44:00.450
So essentially, you make three
short bullet points, one

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.580
sentence each if possible.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.000
We love this example.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: This
is how to get a pony.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:07.730
This is a fun example.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.430
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And then
a single request at the end.

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:10.540
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
A single request.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:11.460
This is a great example.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.080
But I would like to disclaim,
once again, that it doesn't

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.492
work for insane things.

00:44:16.492 --> 00:44:16.860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.890
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It doesn't
work for getting a pony.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:22.020
It doesn't work for getting
Ford to buy your new laser

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.250
windshield wiper idea.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.800
And it's not gonna
get you a meeting

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.060
with the CEO of Amazon.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:26.336
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No.

00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:28.340
But it did work one
time when you were

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.680
working for Apple, before--

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:29.880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --you
got to Google.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.920
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, I've been
refining this since first

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.690
a version of this
worked for me.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.520
I was at Apple about--

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.460
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
10 years ago?

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
11 years ago.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:41.450
And I'd bought my mom one of
those big strawberry iMacs.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.080
It turned out it was
a lemon iMac.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.310
And it just kept failing.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.150
And it spent more time in
the shop than ever.

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.590
And I was super mad and
super frustrated.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:51.340
And somebody was like,
hey, Steve's email is

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.140
sjobs@apple.com.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:53.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Just mail Steve.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:53.843
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Oh, great.

00:44:53.843 --> 00:44:54.770
Oh my God.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:55.820
And I just like started
ranting.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.770
My mom got this computer and
she works at the school and

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.790
she did this and she did
that and she rebooted.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:03.640
And then, you know, like,
it was like 3,000 words.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.540
And this very wise guy I worked
with said, look, you're

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.750
just wasting your time.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.690
He's like, make it short--

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:11.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Really short.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.560
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Really short
and a call to action.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.320
So, I made it really short, as
short as I could, which was

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:17.520
still too long.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.060
And then I said, look, basically
I just want to

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.230
resolve this so my mom
doesn't have this

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.210
crappy, broken computer.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.100
Because I feel bad.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:26.750
I work at Apple.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:27.520
I'm trying to defend it.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.810
And she's telling all
her friends she's

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.990
got this busted computer.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:34.050
And about 15 hours later I got
a call from somebody who

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:34.950
worked for Steve
and said, hey--

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:35.182
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:

00:45:35.182 --> 00:45:36.280
Administrative assistant, perhaps.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:36.530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: No.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.810
It wasn't.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:37.470
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: No, OK.

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:39.840
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Someone in
corporate executive relations,

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.960
which is an assistant
of sorts.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.740
And a week later, my
mom had a new Mac.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.320
And we've refined this,
and we've tried

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.010
this over the years.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:51.910
And the shorter you go-- and
when I say three bullet

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.710
points, I mean, three 80
character bullet points.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:58.290
You can't just keep
going under this

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.560
line wrap stuff, right.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.670
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Now,
sometimes you can

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.200
make links to other--

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.510
like, if you want more detail,
if they're really think

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:08.190
they're gonna need background,
you can put a hyperlink in

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:10.510
there or draw a line and say,
you know, detail is

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.110
below if you care.

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:14.040
But as long as the top
can be parsed in 10

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.090
seconds, you're set.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:15.410
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.570
So.

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.290
Yeah, sometimes I'll do that.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.130
I'll put at the top brief
summary and then long boring,

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.945
long-winded rant--

00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:22.080
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
TLD [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.420
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --after your
signature and everything.

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:28.000
But the fact of the matter is
that executives usually, if

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.980
they can wave a magic wand and
have someone that works for

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:33.710
them right some wrong--

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
They love that.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:34.290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.430
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: They
want to do good.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:36.950
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That is the
best feeling in the world.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.730
They feel like Superman
or Wonder Woman.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.190
They're like, let's
make this happen.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:41.260
This is 10 seconds of my time.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.280
I forward an email.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.460
But if they can't parse it,
they're just gonna, yeah,

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:45.220
delete it and get rid of it.

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.910
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So give
them a chance to be awesome.

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.170
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Super
valuable trick.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So what
happens if you're in a bad

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.430
company and you try all these
things, nothing is--

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.100
things still are horrible.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.277
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you
go to Plan B, right.

00:46:57.277 --> 00:47:00.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Plan
B. What is Plan B?

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.670
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So, we're
gonna talk about Plan B. It

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.670
takes a little bit of time,
but we've got another 45

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:06.800
minutes here.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:13.200
This is Plan B. Plan B is get
the hell out of there.

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:13.850
Now--

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:14.530
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: A
lot of people don't

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.425
consider this option.

00:47:15.425 --> 00:47:16.600
That's just funny to me.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.620
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, we say
this with a little tongue in

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.170
cheek, and we're trying to
be a little funny here.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.080
But we've been giving these
talks since 2007 now--

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.150
2006, technically, I guess.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:29.620
And after these talks, every
year someone comes up to us

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.500
and says, you know, all that
stuff you said, it is great.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.660
But I tried this and I've done
that and I've done that.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.820
I just can't make anything
happen in my company.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.970
And last year at IO, this guy
came up and he asked me all

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.360
these things.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.300
This was two years ago.

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:41.900
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.330
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: He
said all this stuff.

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:44.110
He said what I can do.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:45.930
And I said get the hell
out of there.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.670
I said, update your resume,
start focusing your energy

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.330
into maybe some classes or
training you might need--

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:51.790
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Don't be a victim.

00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:52.290
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
--or whatever.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:52.750
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Right.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: But
don't be a victim.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.230
If you can't change or navigate
the system, start

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.720
putting your energy
into leaving.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.710
Learn your new skills,
start a job hunt.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.930
I got an email from this guy
a couple months ago.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.750
And he said, hey, you're the
guy that told me to get the

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.560
hell out of my job
two years ago.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.020
And I went and took classes.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.450
And I am now--

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:13.090
just got a job offer in Japan as
a product manager for like

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.420
my dream company.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:16.050
So thanks for swearing at me.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:17.620
All right.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.610
But this is an--

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:18.770
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Great story.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:19.870
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --option.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:23.710
The minute you realize that you
can leave, it's incredibly

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:24.090
liberating.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.380
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Empowering, right.

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.790
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Well, you
want to tell Meng's story?

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:27.920
Meng has a story about
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:28.750
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You
tell that story.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:29.260
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: OK.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.820
So Meng, Chade-Meng Tan,
who works at Google,

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:32.530
just wrote a book.

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.550
It's called Search
Inside Yourself.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:35.640
But he has a blog.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.380
And he talks about a lot of
really interesting things.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.150
And he wrote a post earlier this
year that said, every day

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.460
I go into work and I do the
right thing, what I think is

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.040
the right thing.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.560
And then I sit back and
wait to get fired.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:50.160
And if I don't get--

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.260
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Sounds grim.

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.900
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: --fired, then
I realize that this is

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.080
the right company for
me to be working at.

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.950
He said if I do get fired, then
I realize the company's

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:56.770
done me a favor.

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.610
It's done us both a favor
because I won't be trying to

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.860
do the wrong thing for them, and
they won't be trying to do

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:01.830
their own thing for me.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.380
Now, I know this is a little
bit of an extreme case.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.410
And I am very much aware that
not everyone has this luxury.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:07.680
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
But it's a nice

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.410
philosophy to think about.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:10.250
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It is
a nice philosophy.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:13.610
He went on to describe that
his dad lived by this

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.090
philosophy.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:16.560
And every day he would drive
home and he would look at the

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.350
government subsidized
housing in the way.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.450
And he'd think to himself, if I
ever screw up or get fired,

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:24.420
that's where I'm going wind up
living, as a reminder to

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.090
himself of what he had and
what he didn't have.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.000
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So there we go.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.110
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
So that's it.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:30.230
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Let's
talk about-- well,

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.450
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One
more thing, I guess.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:31.350
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Recapping, I guess.

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:31.780
Just a few.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.380
So remember that companies are
made of people, if there's one

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.530
thing you remember
from this talk.

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.710
And being successful as a
software engineer means not

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.050
just being successful with your
code base or knowing the

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.230
latest technologies.

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.580
It also means learning how to
deal with people and how to

00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.650
deal with corporate politics.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.050
It's just as important.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:50.540
And it's something,
unfortunately, you can only

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.110
learned through experience,
for the most part.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.220
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: It's
efficiency, and its

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:53.880
effectiveness.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.940
It's not just about touchy
feely, lovey dovey crap.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:00.100
It's about a way to make your
stuff go a lot further with a

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:00.850
lot less effort.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:01.810
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
you will be happier--

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:02.640
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And
you'll be happier.

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
--as a result.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:04.030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Now, so.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:08.030
But before we wrap up, we've
been giving these talks for

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.420
six years now.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.970
You may have seen or heard
of some of our talks.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:14.360
They're all available
on YouTube.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.160
And I think they're going to
come in here eventually.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:16.905
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So pretty.

00:50:16.905 --> 00:50:17.280
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.940
We love the effect.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:19.400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: You may
have seen us on the internet.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.416
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yes.

00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:21.310
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
So yeah, we have a

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:21.750
bunch of these talks.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:22.870
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And now
we have this talk.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.840
And so, we're really happy
actually to announce--

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.930
we've never announced this
publicly here other then

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:30.280
occasionally on our
G+ accounts.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.160
But, we've written a book that
incorporates this and a whole

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:33.830
bunch of other stuff.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.440
It's called Team Geek.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.360
And it's available.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.680
You could pre-order it.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.730
We won't give you any particular
book seller to buy

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:41.900
it from, like Amazon.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.980
But you could buy it from
wherever you like.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:46.950
And you'll find information
about this talk as well as

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:47.900
other stuff in here.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.030
But it's all about people
aspect of software

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.380
engineering.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.590
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It'll be
out in a couple of weeks.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:53.450
And so we have little cards,
if you're interested.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:54.380
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: They're
at the door.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.680
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Are
at the door, I suppose.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.550
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: So,
thank you, guys.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:57.800
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you
very much for your time.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.420
Now, if you want to leave,
please feel free to run off.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.180
We do have some time for Q&amp;A. We
have two microphones here.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.040
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Please
step up to a mic--

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.580
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: So,
please step up.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:16.630
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --if
you have questions.

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:17.700
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Anything
we can clarify.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.970
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yep.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:22.050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Otherwise,
we'll be hanging around here.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:22.600
Any questions?

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.430
Let's see if anybody hits
the mics, or if we

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:27.130
scared everyone away.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:27.890
Here comes someone.

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:28.560
First question.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.370
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Hello.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:31.640
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.240
A little quick background.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.360
I work a Fortune 10 company.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.460
It has a half a million
employees.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:37.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
All right.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:40.360
MALE SPEAKER: And one of the
big things that we do is--

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.900
like you said, perception is
9/10, and it's almost 10/10 in

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:44.860
some points.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:50.180
And I've seen very technical
engineers work up the ladder

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.250
through hard work and a lot
of perception because they

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.150
understood the climate
very well.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:57.430
But then when they got to a
certain level, they began to

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.710
lose some of that thing that
made them magical.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.760
Having the technical people
in the top level still be

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.850
technical and still understand,
they get lost in

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:08.030
spreadsheets and finance
records and whatnot.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.930
So you being technical
managers, how

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:13.320
did you keep that?

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.110
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: I think to
some degree, we're lucky at

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.350
Google, which is a rare thing.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.970
They actually have two different
ladders, one for

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:21.460
engineering and one for
engineering management.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.780
And they do not cross
the ladders.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.430
And they never force anyone
to move from one ladder to

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:26.470
another, which is unusual.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.170
Typically, in a usual company,
the best engineer climbs up

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.570
the ladder.

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:33.250
And then in order to advance,
they have to become a manager.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:33.720
And now you've--

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.030
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Which
is a terrible idea.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.710
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: --lost the
world's best engineer, and

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.190
you've gained the world's
worst manager.

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:39.550
It's awful.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.050
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: And then that
engineer usually leaves.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:43.120
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Yeah.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.360
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: I think
we're immune from that a

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:45.470
little bit.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.620
But I think there's always
some element of it.

00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.160
And to some extent, you
can push it off.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.730
To some extent, you can
navigate around it.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:53.040
But it's very tricky.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:53.610
It really is.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.510
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's an
argument for focusing on

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:59.200
social skills explicitly and
political navigation, not just

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.650
relying on your technical
expertise and hoping for a

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.190
meritocracy.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:06.920
I mean, it's an argument, I
suppose, that something they

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.220
need to think about and focus
on as an actual activity.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.200
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:11.690
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.230
Thank you.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.720
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.100
Next, please.

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.410
MALE SPEAKER: You touched
on a few things in

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:17.820
your talk about this.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.380
But I was wondering if you
have some specific

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.950
recommendations for staying sane
when you're managing a

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.940
satellite office at
a large company?

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.020
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Geographical distribution.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:27.330
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.580
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
That's a tricky--

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Other
than liberal

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.273
applications of alcohol?

00:53:31.273 --> 00:53:32.790
No, kidding.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:35.320
That's a really good question.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.810
Are you talking about avoiding
the need to have to travel all

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:39.330
the darn time or--?

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.010
MALE SPEAKER: Balancing the
travel, not going stir crazy,

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.134
staying connected.

00:53:44.134 --> 00:53:44.970
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: That's
interesting.

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.590
MALE SPEAKER: You guys are
familiar with this challenge.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.890
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, yeah,
we about this in the

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.470
book a little bit.

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:52.690
One of the things that we
find really useful--

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:55.340
I mean, the reason a lot of
companies like Google, for

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.450
example, is they like people to
be geographically centered

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.960
in one place because there's
so much value in

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.330
face time, in having--

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.900
just being able to swivel around
in your chair and ask

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:08.550
the right person right next to
you a question as opposed to

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:09.870
sending them an email
or getting on

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:11.020
the phone or whatever.

00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.200
You want the friction to
be as low as possible.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.100
One way we have found working
on distributed teams-- we've

00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:17.420
been in that situation--

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.850
is to actually have, like, a
continuous chatroom, like IRC

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:22.150
in particular.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.150
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One
of my teams has

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.695
a Chromebook actually--

00:54:25.695 --> 00:54:26.820
talk about IRC first,
then we'll go on.

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.100
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Well, IRC,
right-- for those people

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.280
who remember what it is--

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.910
it's an actual group chat system
designed for group

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:38.660
chat, not IM with some party
feature stapled on.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:41.260
It's noticeably different.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.740
Everybody would literally just
hang out in an IRC chat room

00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:47.140
all day long, corner of their
screen dedicated to it.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.720
And that became--

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.750
for distributed team working in
three different offices--

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.700
that became our substitute sit
in a circle, swivel all our

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.210
chairs around to talk
to each other.

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:57.070
You could fire a question
in there any time.

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:58.020
Everybody would see it.

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.230
Everybody would reply.

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.710
And it creates, partially, that
allusion of being in the

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.510
same room with everybody.

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:03.510
It really helps.

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.470
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One of my
teams, actually, they use a

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.120
lot of chat.

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.040
But I gave them a Chromebook.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.660
And they set it up between
two of the engineers.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:16.630
And VC Chromebook to the other
engineer in the remote office.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.770
And they had that up pretty much
half the day or so as a

00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:21.550
way to just quickly grab
a question or--

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.060
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: It is
strange to just see a floating

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.940
head in the middle
of a bullpen.

00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.280
Like, is that your
other teammate?

00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.460
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: When people
are coding, they look very

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.600
angry most of the time.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.270
But you have to use everything
in your power to do that.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:36.890
And the fact of the matter is
is that the people, the

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:39.260
engineers who are in the remote
office-- and having

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:41.780
been in the remote office
for many, many years--

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:43.050
it takes more work.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.500
It takes more effort to get
where you're going.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.500
And the advantage of
that is you get to

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.640
live where you want.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:49.210
So--

00:55:49.210 --> 00:55:49.820
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
It's a tradeoff.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:50.500
BRYAN FITZPATRICK:
It's a tradeoff.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:52.100
And we've made that tradeoff.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.470
And we've built an engineering
office in Chicago with the

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:56.770
help of a lot of other people.

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.165
But it's never friction-free
and 100%.

00:55:59.165 --> 00:56:01.030
And you're still gonna have to
get on a plane once in awhile.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.380
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:02.860
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN:
Yeah, sure.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.700
We're almost out of time here.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:04.160
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Almost
out of time?

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.200
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Want
to do one more question?

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:05.680
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: One
last question?

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:06.780
Anyone?

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.243
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: We'll go
out in the hall, if you guys

00:56:08.243 --> 00:56:08.720
want to ask more questions.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:08.880
BRYAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah.

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.500
We'll head out in the hall
and talk some more.

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.090
But thanks a lot, guys.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:11.150
Appreciate it.

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.400
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: Thank you.
