PAUL IRISH: Hi, and welcome
to the next episode of The

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.940
Breakpoint, Breakpoint
number four.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.190
I'm Paul Irish.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.710
Addy Osmani is joining
us in London.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.410
And we will be doing a
Tour of the Timeline.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.580
The Timeline is part of the
Chrome Dev Tools to help give

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.250
you a great view of the overall
performance of the

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.660
application from start
to finish,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.500
including all the parts.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.510
And so it really gives you this
really nice, holistic

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.490
view of how your application is
performing so you can dig

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.510
into the pieces that are
giving you bottlenecks,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.240
whether they're JavaScript,
paint times, reflows, or

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.780
anything else.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.690
And we can help identify what
is exactly slowing our app

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.310
down and fix it.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.910
So we're going to dive into how
to use it, and the kinds

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.150
of insights that it shows.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.890
And generally, you should be
able to walk away from this

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.370
with a much better understanding
of how browser

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.240
internals work, how it
interprets your page, and what

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
you can do to make sure your
app loads and interacts as

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.320
fast as possible.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.290
All Right.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.280
So first things first,
let me bring this up.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.970
So inside the Chrome DevTools
we have the Timeline.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.050
It's about a fifth tab over.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.250
And it's giving you
this overall view.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.030
One of the things that we have
in there is a Events View.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.390
And this is something that
has been in there

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.220
for quite some time.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.170
So I'm going to do a small
little demo on the how this

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.950
comes into practice.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.950
I have up here The New
York Times Skimmer.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.490
A really well-done web
application done by The New

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.870
York Times to show today's
news and such.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.520
So I'm going to bring
up the Timeline.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.540
And it looks like I've got to
wait for the page to kind of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.790
refresh here.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630
There we go, that looks good.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.210
Now I want to record
a new session.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.750
So I can hit this
Record button.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.830
I can also hit Command-E.
It's a lot easier.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm just going to refresh
the page first.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.080
And now I'm going to scroll
to some other sections.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.100
Hit Go, and I'll Open this story
and Close the story.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.900
So that's pretty good.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.160
I'll stop this with Command-E.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.120
And so down here, this
is the full Timeline.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.270
We can drill into a certain
area up at the top by just

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.330
clicking and scrolling.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.900
We can also, with the trackpad,
do a few little

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.770
gestures to zoom
in on the area.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.010
So we can go up by
scrolling up.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.630
And we can narrow
our focus here.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.300
We can also scroll to the side
and pan between them.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.920
And you see all the events are
updating on the bottom.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.580
The other thing to orient
yourself is very small here,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.870
but we have a small blue line
and a red line, and these

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.600
refer to DOM content loaded
and the window.load event.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.580
So let's take a look and
see what's going on.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.940
The first thing that we have up
here is the blue level, and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.290
so this is all network
activity.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.280
Underneath this is yellow
JavaScript execution.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.040
It's happening all the time.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.360
And then the last is kind of
rendering and screen layer.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.260
So paint and rendering.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.950
Purple and green share this
third thing here.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.190
And so I think I refreshed the
page right around this area

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.130
and things were happening.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.100
But while this does tell me the
interaction between the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.270
layers or the browser as it
loads the page, it doesn't

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.340
really give me a good view of
what was slow about anything.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.380
It doesn't give me any
good recommendations.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.730
And I can look down and see for
all these events how long

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.779
they took and see the general
waterfall events as they

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.830
trickle over.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.120
But over this course of a 10
second recording, I don't have

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.970
a good idea about
where to target.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.730
So to do that, I'm going
to switch over to

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.280
the new Frames mode.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.010
So I can switch over
to Frames mode.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.920
Now this gives me a little
bit different of a view.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.690
One of the things in Frames
View is over here on the

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.780
right-hand side, we have
these measures.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.270
So the height of each bar in
Frames View refers to the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.820
length of time that it took to
complete that frame and send

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.710
it up to the screen.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.800
And so something that takes a
short amount of time we could

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.220
send up to GPU really quickly.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.580
And this means that we can keep
the refresh rate as fast

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.220
as possible.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.910
In most cases you want a target
of 60 FPS frame rate.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.090
But some high-end monitors run
at 120 Hertz, and so the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.490
browser will actually be trying
to send 120 updates per

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.680
second to those monitors.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.290
Phones might have a 55
Hertz refresh rate.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.480
So 60 is a general guideline.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.870
Most machines and devices
refresh at that rate.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.110
So you could target that.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.960
But once we have these very long
bars, and that means that

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.580
a frame rate is dipping below
30 FPS, and that's not good.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.320
So we want to identify what we
can do to make that faster.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.495
So let's see, we're going
to take a look in here.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.270
It looks like I might
have found a small

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.640
bug in Canary today.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.050
I'm going to try refreshing
this page and restarting a

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.300
Timeline recording.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.475
Oh, this doesn't look good.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.680
There we go.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.260
What do you think, Addy?

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.080
ADDY OSMANI: Oh, what's that?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.240
This is one of those very few
times that using Canary might

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.690
go a little south.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.600
PAUL IRISH: As you can see, I do
have a Canary update that's

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.850
waiting for me here.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.470
This is fine.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.080
We can adapt to this
situation here.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.270
OK, I'm going to jump over
to a fresh Chromium

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.520
Build that I have.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.600
That's good.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.750
ADDY OSMANI: Paul, this is The
Breakpoint, so things break in

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.420
real time, right?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.570
PAUL IRISH: That's Exactly
what happens.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.345
ADDY OSMANI: So I think
the viewers get it.

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:19.090
PAUL IRISH: All right, good.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.340
I'm glad.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.560
Now we should be good here.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.930
Yeah, this is looking
pretty sharp.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.830
Nice.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.220
We're going to scroll
up to this page.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.620
Oh, I have not saved anything.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.430
OK, good.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.330
And I'll open up this
story, or not.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.870
All right.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.290
So now we've navigated around.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.505
We've recorded a timeline.

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:53.020
If I Zoom in on the DevTools,
you can just Command-Plus to

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.410
always do that.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.090
We have a look.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.610
And like I said, any tall bar
gives an indication that

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.190
things are not running as
smooth as possible.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.010
Especially, when I was
navigating between these

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.160
sections over here on the
right-hand side, it took a

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.930
little time for that transition
to visually happen

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.240
and for it just to complete.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.010
So I was sitting there
waiting a little bit.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:21.920
So I want to find out
what's going on.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.870
my tab did cash.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.660
And that's OK, because right now
I'm just really interested

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.880
in what's going on down
at the bottom here.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.430
So if I scroll down
a little bit--

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:42.690
ah, my crash tab broke
more things.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.480
Oh, this is trouble.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.020
OK.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.510
All right.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.995
I think we're good now.

00:08:58.995 --> 00:09:00.980
Let's hope.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.520
All right, so now we have
a Timeline trace.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.610
The colors that I mentioned
before still apply here.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.580
And so this frame, for
instance, took 88

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.100
milliseconds.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.150
88 milliseconds is a long
time for a frame.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:21.580
If we're keeping with 60 FPS,
then each frame is a short

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.360
16.6 milliseconds.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.580
That's our target.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.830
And when we take longer than
that, then we're holding up

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.340
the user from seeing that
content quickly.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.210
So inside this 80 milliseconds
frame, we have this long

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.050
function call coming
from SoloSource.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:43.380
And let's look into what's
going on inside that.

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:48.280
So it looks like there's all
these small parse events, and

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.135
there's a big, big waterfall
of parsing.

00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:53.990
Now parsing here in Thailand
is just parsing HTML.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.400
Let me show exactly what's
going on here.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.520
Now, I can hover over this and
see actually a trace of why

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.250
we're now parsing.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.210
And it looks like we're inside
of extend HTML5.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.800
So this is probably the HTML
method inside jQuery.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.530
But it was initially called
somewhere in the application

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.330
source called Section
Layout Markup, Cash

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.910
Callback Kindle Response.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.620
So you see the traversal
from New York Times

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.290
Skimmer calling jQuery.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.410
Now the cool thing is I can
click into here and OK, yeah,

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:35.110
it's going to lend 17 of jQuery,
minify jQuery, not

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.580
very useful to me

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.810
Now, if I click the Pretty Print
to get a Pretty Print

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.510
jQuery, and i can hum back the
timeline, you see that my line

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.200
number here is now updated.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.610
So now I can actually click on
line 2185, go to the new

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.390
pretty printed line.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.710
If I scroll over a little bit,
you're going to see this

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.280
innerHTML setting.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.530
So here's exactly where the
innerHTML on this element is

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.140
being set, and that's why
we're calling a parse.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.030
And it looks like what
happened is we had a

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:18.080
succession of about 60 or so
sequential instantiations of

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.040
the HTML5 parsing algorithm.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:29.830
In total, it adds up to about 62
milliseconds, which took a

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.620
decent amount of time.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.930
Now, let me see, I want to
see if we can have-- yes.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:38.030
So there was a small little
hiccup here that we probably

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.280
could have avoided.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.250
So we're parsing HTML, then
we recalc style here.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.780
And then we parse some more.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.910
We recalc style, we layout,
and we paint.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.390
And so recalculation of styles
is taking all the styles in

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.420
style sheets, in the browser's
user agent style sheet, any

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.980
inland styles, figuring out
what the computed style of

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.470
every DOM element on the
page is against what

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.960
the current DOM is.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.600
And now, it looks like we
have to do that twice.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.740
Go back to parsing HTML, and
then do that all over again.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.990
So it's probably likely that
we actually did not need to

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.560
force this recalc style.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.230
The cool thing now is that we
can just hover on recalc style

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.010
and see exactly why these
styles were necessary.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.040
So it looks like the cells
were both invalidated and

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.460
every calculation was forced.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.570
And we can see why exactly
this is happening now.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:44.610
So the styles were invalidated
because on line 846 a class

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.400
name was set.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.100
And any time a DOM
changes, then the

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.650
current DOM is discarded.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.080
We need to find out new
styles for that.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.300
The other one is the style
recalculation was forced.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:06.070
Here inside line 655, we asked
for offset height.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.820
And asking for offset height
basically says hold up

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.010
browser, I know you're busy, but
I need this number, and it

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.210
needs to be correct.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.790
So anything that you're doing,
you need to pause and give me

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.640
this number and make sure
that it's correct.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.230
So even if you're asking for
offset height and then the

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.370
second after you're setting some
HTML it's going to like

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.090
freeze everything, recalculate
all the styles, which is going

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.380
to pause the browser for a
little bit, give you this

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.620
number, and then it can continue
on with the amount of

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.160
work that it was doing.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.970
So there's a few properties
that do this.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.965
The other place you
can go to is Tony

00:13:42.965 --> 00:13:47.560
Gentilcore, trigger, layout.

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.620
Tony Gentilcore is an engineer
on the Chrome team.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.755
And he has a great blog post on
this where he just searched

00:13:54.755 --> 00:13:59.170
the web kit source for all the
properties and methods that

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.350
will force a reflow or a layout,
which in turn forces

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.750
styles to be recalced.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:11.330
So inside here is all of them,
and offset height and offset

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.890
width are in here as well.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.440
Addy, is this making
sense so far?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:16.760
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.130
It looks good so far.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:18.810
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.060
We're going to keep going.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.580
So what happened here is we ask
for these offset heights,

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.420
and then we went right back
into parsing our HTML.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.980
We probably could have avoided
these two pauses and just

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:36.870
continued on.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.240
A lot of times there'll be a
sequence of things where we're

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.330
setting into the DOM and then
you're requesting things like

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.040
offset height, offset
width, and then

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.210
you go back to setting.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.920
And a good way to speed up the
page is to make sure you do

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.990
sets in a row and then
gets in a row.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.340
So eventually, when we finish
this big sequence, we recalc

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.130
style again.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:02.930
We lay it out.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.760
So we lay out the geometry of
the page and how actually all

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.280
the boxes are going
to lay out.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.920
And then we paint.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.250
And here, we can actually just
see a little overlay of the

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.310
area that was painted.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.520
And it's a little bit
off because I

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.740
was resizing my DevTools.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.750
But the main content section I
got painted followed by the

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.540
right navigation.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.240
And so that's just the story
of that single frame being

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.990
computed and being sent
up to the GPU.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:35.950
But this thing can
happen a lot.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.660
So I'm going to look
for something else.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.750
Here's another big frame
at 60 milliseconds.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.710
And here, instead of a lot of
HTML parsing cost, we actually

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.870
had a good amount
of paint cost.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.960
And paint cost can be a little
tricky to debug.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.670
So here we're just going
to open up this guy

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.920
and see what we have.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.180
That's pretty interesting.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.580
This top area got painted.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.790
And inside here, we have
an image decode.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.870
So these image decodes we're
actually added somewhat

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.180
recently to the Chrome
DevTools.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.380
I don't think you'll see
them in Stable, but

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.730
you see them in Canary.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:20.040
In this case we were just taking
a JPEG and decoding it

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.350
from JPEG into bitmap.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.420
And it took a good 20
milliseconds to do that, which

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.260
is a surprisingly long time.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.520
Another thing that is
essentially captured inside

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.310
this paint, and right now it's a
small bug that we're fixing,

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.530
is imagery sizing.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:45.343
So in this case, we had a lot
of images that came in like,

00:16:45.343 --> 00:16:48.240
let's say this one.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.020
A lot of the source images
that were used in this

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.990
application came in at their
native size of 1024 pixels

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.470
wide or 600 pixels wide, and
they're just scaled to fit in

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.030
the area where they
should fit.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.390
A lot of times this
is necessary.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.110
And there's not much way
you can get around it.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.869
But the actual cost of doing
that resizing is something

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:09.260
that we're now able to see.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.839
So typically, an image decode
is always followed by an

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.451
imagery size.

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.619
ADDY OSMANI: Suppose the
suggestion there that people

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:18.780
use prescaled images.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:19.599
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.650
That is pretty much
the suggestion.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.609
If you can definitely serve up
images that are scaled to the

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.710
correct resolution, the page is
going to load a lot faster,

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.980
and scrolling speed is also
going to be a lot faster

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.990
because images are decoded
lazily based on when the user

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.720
needs to see them.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.590
So we're not going to decode the
entire page worth even if

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.700
none of it's visible.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.650
So it's going to really speed up
scrolling and also speed up

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.230
something like this.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.760
The other thing I should mention
is that in Chrome,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:53.130
image decoding right now does
operate on the main thread.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.480
So we have to wait for this
image to decode before we can

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.860
run any JavaScript
for instance.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.050
That's the current
state of things.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.260
Although, that's improving.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.250
And we actually expect industry
codes to have an off

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.290
thread very soon, which is going
to speed up things quite

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:08.730
considerably.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:14.140
So serve images scaled to the
resolution that you need them

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:19.240
at, and watch this area.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.710
Now, it looks like, yeah, we
painted this area up top.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:30.690
And sometimes with a view that
is not changing so much, we

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.500
can actually keep track and
identify which image it is and

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.930
where it was located.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.750
But in this case, because the
app has been moved around a

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.890
bit, it's a bit trickier.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:46.780
So overall, this is the way that
we can diagnose what's

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.310
going on with the application
from a performance perspective

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.030
and figure it out.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.900
And the thing that I also want
to point out here is that in

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:58.170
the past when something operates
pretty slow, people

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:01.630
normally dive into fiber of
the profiler or the CPU

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.010
profiler over here, and just
start recording and

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.450
identifying JavaScript that
is taking a long time.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.390
But what we end up seeing in
this timeline trace is that

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.250
actually there's
a lot of cost.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.590
A lot of the time that's taking
the browser a little

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.540
bit of pause in delivering this
content to the user is

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.870
not JavaScript.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.920
And so I recommend to use the
timeline to record a session

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.110
of any slow interaction.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.100
Then identify what's going
on inside there.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:38.570
Maybe you do have really big
yellow spikes, but those

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.830
yellow spikes might just be a
bunch of HTML settings or

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.480
something else.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.500
So this is a good way to
identify where exactly your

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:46.310
bottleneck is.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:52.290
Is it in script or is it just
completely in rendering costs.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.030
So this is a good way to
prioritize exactly what your

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.270
performance costs are.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.850
I think I got a pretty decent
coverage on that.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:04.650
ADDY OSMANI: I think
you've got some

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.210
great coverage in there.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.000
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.270
I wanted to see if there's
anything else

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.910
that I should mention.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.480
No, I think that's good.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.680
One thing I did want to show
real quickly is a new

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.970
experimental part that we're
playing with inside Chrome.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.220
And this is not yet available
for everyone, but we want to

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.620
see what you guys think of it.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.850
I went through and looked at
some of the properties that

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.830
are normally a little
bit slow.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.060
They can be slow in CSS.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:41.450
And I present this list with
a lot of hesitation.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.900
Things that are slow now may
not be the things that are

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.800
still in the future.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.300
So do not take these as
guidelines or advice on what

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.570
to avoid, more just like this
is a snapshot of the current

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.620
present state.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.460
But the key here is to always
test for yourself because my

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.420
bottlenecks are not
your bottlenecks.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.290
For instance, Box Shadow is
kind of known as something

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.000
that's quite slow, at desktop
and on mobile.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.740
And I'm going to show you a
little bit about how to

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:14.310
actually see that now with
this experimental future.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:20.840
So I'm going to come over
to this little demo.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.650
And in this demo, as I scroll
the page, I have a few dancing

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.140
Chrome logos.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.950
But I can also add this check
box, which adds in some CSS

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.220
gradients in there and
some box shadow.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:43.170
Now, if I record a timeline of
this section, this page, and I

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.865
make it dance a little bit,
you can see that--

00:21:48.865 --> 00:21:51.580
I'm narrowing that focus
a little bit.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.900
You can see that I just have
really long pain times, 25

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.150
milliseconds just to paint.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.980
Those are considerable.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:05.660
And I don't really have a good
idea on what is involved here.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.090
So what we can do actually
to identify exactly what

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.270
components are contributing to
this longer paint time is we

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:22.450
can turn on this new feature
called force repainting.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.940
So now it might be a little
tough to see, but in the top

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.430
right corner, I have both a
meter that represents my

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:38.960
current frames per second and
also a rate of the paint rate.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.700
And what this mode is actually
doing is force

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.490
repainting all the time.

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.050
Normally, the browser only
paints when it has to, but

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.790
this mode just says just keep
painting, just keep painting,

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.840
because we want to be able to
measure things and we're going

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.250
to change this situation.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.040
ADDY OSMANI: Paul, if you're
constantly repeating, is that

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.702
something that's reflected in
the DevTools as well, like in

00:23:00.702 --> 00:23:01.270
the timeline.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.260
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, exactly.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.276
So if I just turn this on, I'm
not touching anything, it's

00:23:05.276 --> 00:23:06.110
just like--

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.610
ADDY OSMANI: Wow!

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.650
PAUL IRISH: --paint, paint,
paint, paint paint, paint.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.130
So there's no reason
that you'd need

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.870
this as a user certainly.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.930
But as a developer, you're able
to just replicate heavy

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.990
painting situations
repeatedly.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.080
And this enables you to
try some things out.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.495
So I'll actually, you know what,
I'll try and keep this

00:23:26.495 --> 00:23:27.750
timeline on.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.350
And I'm going to come
over to Elements.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.470
I'm going to Select
this image.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.880
And I'm going to turn off
this CSS gradient.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.280
And I'm going to turn up
this background size,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.490
and this box shadow.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.800
Now I'm going to come
back to timeline.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.520
Yeah, that should be a big,
dramatic difference.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.230
Nice.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:54.630
So we go from pretty long
paint sizes down

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.510
to very short ones.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.640
And over in the top right we
have this paint rate meter,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.200
which is telling me
the million--

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.035
right now I'm painting about 220
million pixels per second.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:17.500
But when I have, let's see,
all the costly effects on,

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.910
that dives down to about 35.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:28.760
So this is a pretty big
jump from 35 to 220.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.500
So we're able to identify
exactly just by toggling

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.760
things on and off what's
contributing to paint times.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.120
Maybe it's individuals styles.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.310
In a lot of websites, there's
a very large div with a box

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.445
shadow around it.

00:24:42.445 --> 00:24:45.980
And you can toggle things off,
apply display, none, or

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.180
visibility hidden to them.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:52.090
See what the result is in
this mode or over in

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.070
timeline paint length.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.140
And then identify where
this is going.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.390
In the future that might be
something like a report, a

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.810
profiling report, where we can
identify by element, by style

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.230
what's contributing to paint.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.760
It's a little tricky because
these things are additive, but

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.980
for now, this is a great tool to
identify what is going on.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.580
How that's sound?

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.110
ADDY OSMANI: That sounds
pretty cool.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.460
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.470
ADDY OSMANI: So do you see when
people are developing

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.470
applications that are complex
and have rich animations, do

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.150
you see them actually making
perhaps design decisions based

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.270
on what some of this
is reporting back?

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:33.610
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.030
So it's a little trickier.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.670
So clearly, the fastest
situation here is just get rid

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:46.650
box shadow, get rid of CSS
gradients and box background

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.462
size et cetera.

00:25:49.462 --> 00:25:54.150
If you don't have any CSS, it's
going to be really fast.

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:56.080
But that's not feasible.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.090
So there's a few ways
to deal with this.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.560
In diagnosing long paints,
like I said, we can just

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.900
Display-None to remove it out
of the geometry of the page,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.090
and it won't contribute
to layout at all.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.040
With Visibility-hidden, it won't
contribute to paint.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.830
So we can just toggle entire
elements off and on like this.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.780
We measure it with either a
timeline recording like I

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.750
showed or this new experimental
mode, which we

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.120
hope to be able to share
in a public build soon.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.070
And then just identify
and iterate.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.900
Now if there is a situation like
you're asking about where

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.780
it is bad, what do you do, you
can Remove Styles, you can try

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.960
and simplify some of the styles
maybe you don't need a

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.920
60 pixel blur on your box shadow
with like 0.2 alpha and

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.410
you could actually just change
it to be able to smaller and

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.730
harder alpha.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.390
Talk with your designer and
identify a different sort of

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.550
interaction frame.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.250
Let's say we had a modal alert
coming up, now I can't imagine

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.650
the situation where you would
animate a box shadow from

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.710
being really big into small.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.980
And that would look cool.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.170
But a much faster way of doing
this is doing a 2D transform

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:14.780
with translate just to scale it
in from the top right and

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.840
have a little bit of bounce.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.210
That's going to sit
on the GPU.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.500
Be really, really fast.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.910
So there's some situations where
you can kind of work

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.220
with your designer to find a new
style of interaction that

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.290
works a lot better.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:31.140
And lastly, I know this is not
cool at all to say, but you

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.293
can use images instead
of using CSS.

00:27:34.293 --> 00:27:35.160
ADDY OSMANI: Oh my god.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.170
PAUL IRISH: I said it.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.150
That was terrible.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:48.030
So gradients or box shadow,
border image can work.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.600
So look into it.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.100
This is not like a guarantee
that images are

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.490
always faster than CSS.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.200
But it's something that you want
to try out especially, if

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.175
you're measuring things and
identifying that these are

00:27:58.175 --> 00:28:02.030
your bottlenecks and this is
possibly something to fix.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.530
You always want to measure
before and after to identify

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:08.830
is this really worth
it, maybe not.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.960
So that's essentially
what we can do.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.420
Addy, can you talk a little bit
about another part of the

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:20.890
timeline that I didn't get to?

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:21.300
ADDY OSMANI: Sure.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.450
So we're going to be talking
about Memory mode.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.700
Paul talked about Events and
he talked about Frames.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.010
But Memory mode is really cool
because it gives you an

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.250
overview of your application's
memory usage over time.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.610
It can help you diagnose whether
some of the initial

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.420
symptoms about whether you
might have a memory link.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.480
So Paul has just opened
up a little demo

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.160
application we have.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:49.040
And we're going to switch over
to the Memory Paint.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.260
Now this application
is quite simple.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:54.970
The Idea is that you scroll
through it, and it will keep

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:56.560
displaying new images.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.320
And when you click on an image,
it will display a

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.570
larger version of it.

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.980
We've got a clear timeline,
let's record a new session and

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.230
perform some actions.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.745
So as you can see, our timeline
is populating.

00:29:12.745 --> 00:29:15.350
Can we click on some of those
images just to see

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.600
what impact that has?

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.320
Awesome.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.730
Let's stop that.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.080
So cool.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.910
Again, in the top view, you've
got your Summary view.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.190
And in the bottom, you've
got a Details view.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:32.480
And in the Summary view, you'll
notice the memory usage

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.220
increasing as you move between
the different parts of your

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.570
applications.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.560
The light-blue area represents
the amount of memory being

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.180
used by your app at
a particular time.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.110
And the remaining white area
represents the total amount of

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.470
allocated memory that
you've got.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.450
And this is quite normal.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.140
This type of a curve is actually
quite normal because

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.300
garbage collection is going to
be happening during the course

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.750
of all the interactions.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.783
And v8, the JavaScript engine
being used by Chrome, is going

00:29:58.783 --> 00:30:00.810
to be running rounds of garbage
collection when your

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.320
app is idle.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.860
Now, taking a look at the
Details view, which is one at

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.970
the very bottom, you can see
we've got some sort of curve.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.340
Now a few cycles after garbage
collection, ideally your

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:16.770
memory profile, so that
curve, should be going

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.040
a little bit flat.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.650
And if it's constantly going up
between different garbage

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:25.060
collection cycles, you might
have a memory leak.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.300
That's a problem.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.550
Now going back to the Summary
view at the very top, another

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.370
way that you can tell that there
might be a problem is if

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.690
you see a sawtooth.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.060
Now, that basically represents
the cost of doing

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:38.890
business in your app.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:43.350
So let's say that you were using
RequestAnimationFrame,

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.110
that might give you a little
bit of garbage.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.890
But it's the steepness of your
curve that you need to keep an

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.390
eye on, because if that curve is
really steep, it means that

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.720
you're generating a
lot of garbage.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.100
Similarly, in the Details view,
if you've got a STUFF

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.730
function, that is also
a sign that you might

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:00.980
have a memory leak.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.620
On the next episode, we're
going to be talking you

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.600
through a tool called
the Heap Profiler.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.930
It will actually help you use
some of this information to go

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.910
and dig down and find out
exactly what is causing the

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:20.280
memory leak and how you can
go and you can fix it.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.220
Now, one thing that I missed
out on, if we go back to

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.910
Timeline very quickly and take
a look at the left, is there

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.330
are three pieces of information
on the left.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.780
We've got the Document Count,
the Dome Node account, and the

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.140
Event Listener account.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.890
Now, the DOM Node count shows
the number of created DOM

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.380
nodes that are still being
held in memory.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.020
And the others represent the
same for your Event Listeners

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.610
and your Document instances,
like your IFrames.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.500
And the Timeline view allows you
to filter down on these.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.297
So if you wanted to, for
example, just display the DOM

00:31:52.297 --> 00:31:55.420
Node counts, you could just
deselect the other options as

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.670
Paul has just shown you.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.940
Just like any of the other
panels, you can select a range

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.240
in your Summary view and drill
down to more specific pieces

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:09.700
of information.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.830
And hopefully, on the next
episode, we're going to show

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.800
you how you can take this
information that might suggest

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.916
you have a memory leak and
actually help you fix it.

00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:19.820
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:20.780
OK.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.250
So one last thing I just want
to show real quick, which is

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.640
that for all these things we
can improve the situation,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:30.180
especially on this machine.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.350
This is a very recent machine.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:36.540
And I can get 60 FPS or I could
kill my memory leaks,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.780
but what about on a
mobile situation.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.980
Now let's handle that.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.020
So I want to show
this real quick.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.970
So what I have on my phone
right here is I have an

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.960
instance of New York Times
Skimmer running

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.840
on Carbon on Android.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:03.710
And I also have my Chrome
here connected to

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.070
remote debug that instance.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.153
It looks like I need
to refresh this.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.610
Come back.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.380
There we go.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.700
Nice.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.070
All right.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.890
So now I'm remote debugging
my Chrome on Android.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:35.776
And what I'm going to do is
very similar to before.

00:33:35.776 --> 00:33:37.325
Oh, it's this guy.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.330
You might not be able to get
to see this unfortunately.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.220
ADDY OSMANI: I imagine
it looks very cool.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.650
PAUL IRISH: It looks so cool.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.110
Oh.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.790
All right, here we go.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.440
Great, so it's a little hard
to see in this situation.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.500
But I'm just navigating the
sections up and down before

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.440
like I was on the desktop.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.659
And we're able to see down
here a similar situation.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:15.500
But the difference is that what
the events actually show

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.060
is that whereas before, remember
I had that very long

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.370
sequence of parse events
that took about 60

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.980
milliseconds on desktop.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.360
On the mobile situation, that
exact same sequences taken

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.520
around 250 milliseconds.

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.560
So it gives you a little bit
of context as far as even

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.340
though you take care of an
optimization on desktop, you

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.639
really have to think
about what the

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.350
cost is here on mobile.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.580
And I'm really excited about
these tools telling a much

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:50.659
richer story about how exactly
things are taking what are

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.219
your costs and expense of
operations on a mobile device

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.600
where the story is much more
different than what you're

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.870
used to on desktop.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.950
So I guess, again, to wrap up,
Timeline gives a great overall

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.280
view of the picture and allows
you to dive into exactly what

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.840
is causing you costs.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.940
A lot of these features that I
showed and that Addy showed

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.790
are in the Canary version
of Chrome that can run

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.990
side-by-side with Stable.

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.710
We recommend trying that out.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.880
But they're making their way
to Stable very quickly.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.480
And so that's about it.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.820
ADDY OSMANI: Awesome.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.540
So just take a look
at the questions

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.740
we've got real quick.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.700
[? Tinta Suresh ?]

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:36.310
from New Delhi asks, "some
features in CSS3 are still

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.470
developing, and they're slow.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:41.520
If RequestAnimationFrame is
used, will it affect the

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.830
performance of map?"

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.745
PAUL IRISH: What was the
last part of that?

00:35:46.745 --> 00:35:48.970
ADDY OSMANI: If
RequestAnimationFrame is used

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.860
instead, will it affect the
performance of map?

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.100
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.350
Good question.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.080
Yeah, there's a great
answer to this.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.480
You're probably used to doing
something like animating with

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:13.130
jQuery an element from
left to right.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:15.420
And so you'll grab the Element
in jQuery and you'll say

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.530
animate and give it a pixel
offset and give it a speed.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.940
And so what that is actually
doing is just running a set

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:30.780
timeout loop to operate about
every 10 milliseconds to

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.350
change the inline style.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:37.810
Now instead, you can use
something like the jQuery

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.940
RequestAnimationFrame plug-in
that just swaps in the

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:40.920
animation internals.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.570
It was written by a jQuery Core
Development team member.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.260
It swaps in the animation
internals to use

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.950
RequestAnimationFrame instead.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.960
The impact that this has
is pretty significant.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.790
With a 10 milliseconds set
timeout, which is how jQuery

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.950
normally does it, you end
up missing frames.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:06.140
So if we're shooting to have a
new frame available to the GPU

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:12.670
60 times a second, giving the
browser something new every 10

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.640
milliseconds does not
synchronize up well with

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.390
[INAUDIBLE], the screen
expecting

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.300
60 changes per second.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.510
And so about half of the
frames that jQuery is

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.590
generating by way of setting
an inline style never even

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:31.210
make it to the screen,
which is bad.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.870
You're doing all the work
and the users is

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.130
not getting the payoff.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.240
And so things can be
a lot less smooth.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.580
So always use
RequestAnimationFrame,

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.830
certainly if you're doing Canvas
or WebGL, but if you're

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:46.700
doing any sort of DOM animation,
like changing

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.380
inline styles.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.420
And if you're doing any
scrolling parallax situations

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.520
where as you scroll positions
are kind of

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:56.780
changing and things--

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.130
popular these days--

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.740
this is also another
great case to use

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.950
RequestAnimationFrame to send
up new updates to the screen

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.360
rather than putting
it all inside a

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.610
single on scroll handler.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.250
And so that's basically
the best way

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.470
to handle that situation.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:16.150
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.840
And we'll be sure to show
the link to jQuery

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.850
RequestAnimationFrame at the
show frameworks, check it out.

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.060
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.490
Thank you everyone
for joining, and

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.530
see you next time.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.580
ADDY OSMANI: See
you next time.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.830
Bye.
