00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:02.450
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.870
I'm a developer advocate
on the Chrome team.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.610
And I'm working on trying
to make the mobile web

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.690
platform better for developers
and trying to educate people

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.190
on how we think mobile
web development should

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.910
be kind of doing, I suppose.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.660
I was going to start
this off by saying

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.364
that I think everyone
in California

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:21.280
is a little bit too
cheery, especially because

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.988
of the sunny weather
and everything else.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.110
So I decided to bring all
the wet weather with me

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.884
from London, just so
everyone kind of experiences

00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:29.050
what it feels like to be me.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.180
So I suppose the first
question everyone has,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.640
why mobile web UX at a
developer conference,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.540
and why someone like me is
talking about mobile web UX?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.892
Well, I always used to
have this impression of--

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:47.410
is anyone actually a UX designer
or an interaction designer?

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.580
OK, I'll be careful.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.860
I always used to think
UX or interaction design

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.670
was for people who wore
turtleneck sweaters and berets.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.720
But it actually
turned out that UX

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.360
is critically important
for everything

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.320
that we do when we're
building applications.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.629
And if you're a
developer, and you're not

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.650
skilled in the arts of
user experience like me,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.930
what do you do?

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.040
So it's critically important
as well for the mobile context

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.400
because-- I don't need to
tell you guys all about this.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.240
But we know mobile
is big, right?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.260
Unit sales are kind
of skyrocketing.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.470
OK, there's an existing
desktop presence out there.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.640
But every single one of
these devices that gets sold

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.200
has a really capable
mobile browser on there.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.000
And if you look at
some of the work

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.855
that the Apps team
have been doing

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.480
over the past couple
of months, they've

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.620
been doing research
on what people

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.750
like about mobile, what people
think about mobile websites.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.130
And pretty much everyone likes
a mobile-based experience.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.480
They hate desktop
experiences on the web.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.930
So we know mobile's huge.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.520
And if we're developers, how
do we deal with this context

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.670
where we need to define and
build for the mobile web?

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.286
Well, if you look at kind of
the way mobile native is going,

00:01:53.286 --> 00:01:54.910
they're kind of really
pushing forwards

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.550
on what it means to be a native
developer and a native kind

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.440
of UX or native experiences.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.880
And they're trying
to push forward

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.671
these kind of different
interaction styles.

00:02:03.671 --> 00:02:06.380
So we have, obviously,
voice interaction.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.060
That's a big thing
on native platforms

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.270
now, whether it's Google Now or
Siri and these types of things.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.840
We also have card-based
interfaces and gestures,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.340
and all these things that
didn't really exist maybe one,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.522
two years ago.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:20.980
And if you compare
that to the web,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.438
we are actually doing pretty
well on the web at the moment,

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:25.280
in the sense of we
are starting to get

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.780
some great mobile-based
experiences out there.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.950
We've got Forecast,
the BBC, Yahoo.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.915
Everyone is building
these kind of-- everyone

00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:33.680
who knows and gets
that mobile is

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.640
critical is starting to build
mobile-based experiences.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.920
But they don't take
advantage of as much

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.740
of the hardware capabilities
and interaction patterns

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.000
that native applications
are starting to do.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.710
So my talk was going
to be about how

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.990
we could bridge that
gap, how we could start

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.430
to use voice
interactions, how we

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.820
could start to
use swipe gestures

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.590
and card-based interfaces.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.370
But I look at the-- well, the
top 1,000 sites, originally.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.540
And I was trying to assess what
the common patterns are, what

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.499
the mobile-ness
of the sites are.

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.040
And it was actually
really startling.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.230
We found some really kind
of interesting things

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.942
where 53% of sites still
had a desktop experience.

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:12.650
And these are the top
1,000 sites, right?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.130
This is the head of the
mobile web is still desktop.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.880
There's a couple of
really great examples,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.510
Wikipedia and Google,
Yahoo, and a bunch

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.890
of others that get mobile.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.156
But everyone else in the
mobile web, it kind of sucks.

00:03:25.156 --> 00:03:26.530
They don't actually
seem to think

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.470
that the mobile web
is actually important.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.630
And this desktop experience
is actually pretty bad

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.934
because, basically, the
way the browser works

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.100
is, it goes, well, we know
you've got a desktop web.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.190
The web is for
desktops at the moment.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.560
So we're going to have
to scale everything down

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.220
to fit on a mobile device.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.970
And if you look at some of
the stats from Nat's team.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.960
And I'll try and
share a link later on,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.770
where basically
76% of users prefer

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.470
optimized mobile experiences.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.267
This was a survey of
1,000 users at the time.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.850
And no one is really
catering for that

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.900
at all on the mobile web.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.186
We also found that 25%
of sites, regardless

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:02.060
of whether they were
mobile optimized or not,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.730
their content didn't fit
in the mobile viewport.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.122
And this is an example of
a site where basically you

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:08.330
could scroll around the site.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.010
You couldn't zoom
out from that view.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.676
It was terrible.

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:11.470
You can't zoom out.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.160
You have to pan around
the user interface just

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.970
to read some text.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.960
It's not a great
user experience.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.242
And it's quite common
in the top 1,000 sites.

00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:20.200
And we found that a whole
bunch of developers--

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.090
I think it was actually
65% of users, sorry--

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.732
hated the fact that they have
to scroll around the content

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.440
to actually find the
piece of information

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.840
that they want to
find on the site.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.620
And then we found
that 83% of sites

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.480
had hard to touch
areas on the screen.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.054
Now, quite a lot of these sites
were-- just maybe one or two

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:39.720
little buttons were
kind of quite small.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.210
But then you get sites
like Hacker News, which

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.320
I know a lot of
people really love,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.730
and I absolutely
love it as well.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.110
But it's completely
not optimized

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.080
for the mobile experience.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.079
And then when you actually
try and click a link,

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.600
the browser has a
really hard time

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.187
trying to figure out what you
actually meant to click on.

00:04:53.187 --> 00:04:55.770
This is actually a really hard
problem to solve at the moment,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.410
well, on a desktop
type of experience.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.840
But when you're building
mobile experiences,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.360
it gets a little bit easier.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.380
And this is my
blog from ages ago.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.150
It's horrible.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.660
And as you can see, I'm
not a graphics designer

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.284
or an interaction
designer or anything.

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:10.580
But basically, of the top
1,000 sites, 60% of them

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.899
had readability issues.

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:13.440
And this actually
comes from the fact

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.429
that if you're not
developing a mobile site,

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:19.970
and the site has to get squished
down onto the mobile device,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.770
without zooming in, you have a
real hard time actually reading

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.650
the text.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.750
And if you see from
this screen shot,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.990
actually what Chrome
has tried to do

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.240
is tried to be clever and
actually boost the font size

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.351
as well using the text
auto-size that Greg

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:32.350
talked about earlier on.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.090
And I'm going to kind of briefly
talk about that later on.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.430
But basically, text is not
readable in the mobile web

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.710
at the moment, it seems.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.040
And 10% of sites in
the top 1,000 sites

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.850
still used plug-ins,
plug-ins that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.000
don't work on the
mobile web, Flash,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.320
Java applets, Silverlight,
Unity 3D, all these things

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.494
where we've been building kind
of rich internet applications.

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:54.660
And they've been able to
do some great stuff for us.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.250
But people still
actually have this

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.990
deployed on the
modern mobile web.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.410
So actually, this is my
first ever kind of mini

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.420
product announcement.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.960
We're trying to
build a tool that

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.260
helps you identify and
understand the problems

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.450
that you would have
as a web developer.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.690
And this tool is
kind of-- the tool

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.390
is kind of focused towards more
of the developers who are not

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.170
naturally interaction designers,
just to help you identify all

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.270
those issues that we
talked about before.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.430
So I know Bryan mentioned
PageSpeed Insights

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.760
a couple of minutes ago,
where it analyzed your network

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.442
performance of your site
in the context of mobile.

00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:30.150
Well, we're extending
this further today.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.941
And it's in the test
version at the moment.

00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.480
You're the first guys
to actually see this.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.150
But we're extending
PageSpeed Insights

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.420
to also do user
experience analysis.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.470
And we're trying to get
the fundamentals correct.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.775
We're not trying to say,
hey, your navigation

00:06:42.775 --> 00:06:43.525
is kind of busted.

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:45.830
Your off-screen menus and
all these types of things

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.590
don't work.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.173
We're trying to make
sure you actually

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:49.410
get the fundamentals correct.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.951
And I'm going to go through a
quick demo of this in a minute.

00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:56.459
But basically, this tool loads
your site in a mobile context

00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:59.000
and then analyzes it to check
for the viewport, the viewpoint

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.880
content size, whether the
text is actually readable,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.860
whether the links and buttons
and other areas are clickable.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.150
And it identifies the
uses of legacy plug-ins.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.280
Now, this is very
kind of early stage.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.780
And we really, really,
really want your feedback

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.180
on this tool, whether you
think some of the insights

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.560
are a little bit too harsh
or critical and other

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.370
types of things that you, as
developers, can understand--

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.540
features that we could
assess programmatically

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.257
by just analyzing the page.

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:25.840
So I'm going to give
you a quick demo.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.407
I will say, if you bump on
ux=1 at the end of PageSpeed

00:07:31.407 --> 00:07:33.990
Insights, you'll be able to go
and test this today on your own

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.930
sites.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.950
I'm just going to go
and analyze a site which

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.750
I know is terrible, and it
fails every single test.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.905
It's actually my site.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.050
So I was actually
looking for sites.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.799
And I was like, I'll try
my old site from 2010.

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:52.090
Yeah, and it failed everything.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.347
It was terrible.

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.930
But anyway, as you
can see here, we've

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.530
got kind of the mobile side.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.950
This is the rendered view
from a headless WebKit.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.050
It's got all the speed
criteria that Bryan

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.320
talked about before to help
you build better mobile network

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.350
performance.

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.190
But it's also got this whole
area for user experience.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.560
And what it tries to do is say,
hey, we've rendered the page.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.394
We've looked at what
the content looks like.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.185
And we're going to tell
you the areas where

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:18.500
we think you should improve.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.790
And if you've got a
purely desktop experience,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.697
quite often it tells you you
need to improve everything.

00:08:23.697 --> 00:08:25.530
But if you've got a
mobile-based experience,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.100
the number of criteria checks
that it kind of fails on

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.660
gets a lot smaller.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.284
The first is legible text.

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:33.159
This is kind of cool.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:35.130
So it basically identifies
every single piece

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.620
of text on the web
page-- I'll just

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.650
zoom in a little bit-- which
doesn't render clearly,

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.817
doesn't meet the minimum,
say, 12-point style font size.

00:08:44.817 --> 00:08:45.900
Now, this is kind of cool.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.830
So I've got a whole
load of things.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.496
I used to work for
Switch Media, so that

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:50.810
was the company I
used to work at.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.581
Let's have a look.

00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:53.580
"My Dad's Cycling Blog."

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.190
OK.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.310
So you can click on a
link, and it highlights it

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.210
inside the user
interface exactly where

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.770
the identified problem is.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.780
This is really cool
because if you're

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.530
trying to find different
areas of the text

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.260
on your page which
have got problems,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.880
then you can actually kind of
identify that pretty quickly.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.282
The really nice thing-- and I
think it's there in the API.

00:09:12.282 --> 00:09:14.740
But there's an API back end to
this, which you can actually

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.198
programmatically run through
your own workflow tools, which

00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:20.970
you could then use against your
site, which would analyze UX

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.177
problems across your
site automatically.

00:09:23.177 --> 00:09:24.010
So it's pretty cool.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.460
We can find all
these different areas

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.120
where everything kind of fails.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.799
And because it's a
desktop site, you

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:32.090
can see pretty much everything
is a little bit rubbish.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.820
And it tells you kind
of roughly how tall

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.390
it is on the screen
at that time.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.420
So that's legible text.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.540
The other thing
is touch targets.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.560
So we identify all
the areas on the page

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.310
where there's
potential for confusion

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.560
by the browser or
the user into what

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.170
would be clicked, essentially.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.950
So in many cases,
obviously, it's links.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.080
And it's links inside
text, for instance.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.130
But it's also input
elements, form inputs.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.710
Everything that basically
has a click event which

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.700
you can listen to,
it will identify,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.620
look at, and inspect to see
whether it's correctly sized.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.260
So as we can see here, the
search box on this page

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.410
is too small.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.190
It's actually-- I don't
know whether it was a-- oh.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.990
There we go.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.070
Do it again.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.490
It's actually identified the
fact that it's-- and this is

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.740
why it's {beta} at the moment.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.460
So we look at this
radio box, it's

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.922
714 micrometers on
a typical device.

00:10:23.922 --> 00:10:26.130
I don't know what web
developers go and do with that.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.734
But all we know is
it's really small.

00:10:28.734 --> 00:10:30.400
But we've got all
these other areas here

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740
where we're trying to identify
all these potential touch

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.689
targets which could
be mis-clicked.

00:10:35.689 --> 00:10:36.480
But that's not all.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.410
There's also this area
here at the bottom

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.300
which identifies
targets which actually

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.620
need additional spacing.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.470
Because the way that
the browsers work is

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.580
they try and disambiguate
the clicks in the areas

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.762
where the user is
clicking on the page.

00:10:47.762 --> 00:10:49.220
And if there are
two elements which

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.800
are pretty close or
potentially overlapping,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.550
then that creates the potential
for confusion for users.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.341
And one of the things
that we're doing here

00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:58.680
is we're trying to identify
the tap targets which

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.030
would potentially be
too close and overlap

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.400
and actually provide potentially
the wrong action for the user.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.400
And then some of the basic
things as well, size,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.950
the content for the viewport.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.160
As you can see here, everything
is sized incorrectly.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.140
But what this is
trying to say is--

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.080
this is the critical area here--
that the actual physical size

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.590
of the page is 1,299 CSS pixels.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.010
And if you've ever done any
mobile web development before,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.301
you'll know that the actual
default size of the browser

00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:25.840
is 980 pixels or 960 pixels.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.300
Or no, 980, sorry.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.350
What this basically
means is if the content

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.380
busts outside the viewport--
it's too big for the viewport--

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.000
rather than scale
it down further,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.780
it forces the user to have to
pan and scroll around the site.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.040
So we're trying to identify
areas where on the page

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.450
you've got content
on the page which

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.610
will cause the page to bust out
the side of the mobile device,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:49.510
in theory at least.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.360
And then we have the
configure the viewport.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.820
Now this is a
relatively simple test.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.470
If you haven't got a
viewport, it'll tell you,

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:55.270
you haven't got a viewport.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.644
If you haven't got a viewport,
and then you just drop one

00:11:57.644 --> 00:11:59.950
into your site, you're not
going to have a good time.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.390
So you're going to have to
think about actually building

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.556
a mobile experience, which
I'm going to try and talk

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.210
about for the rest
of this talk now.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.460
So this is PageSpeed Insights.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.126
This is one of the
things that we really

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:11.530
want you to go kind of go
out, play with, give us

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.936
a whole bunch of feedback
about whether you think

00:12:14.936 --> 00:12:16.560
these checks are
actually good for you,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.180
whether they actually
work on your site as well.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.980
Because we found
instances where there's

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.800
bugs for-- tap target
menus across the top

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.750
just don't work very well.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.510
But we want as much
feedback as possible.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.968
And if you go to
that page, there's

00:12:28.968 --> 00:12:30.880
a feedback link
right at the bottom.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.220
So this talk really is about
mobile web UX building blocks,

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.680
getting the basics
right so that we

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.350
can build really
compelling experiences

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.120
on the top in the
future, whether that's

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.980
with Polymer kind
of web components

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:42.410
and a whole load of other stuff.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.240
We want to get to
the point where

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.320
you don't have to worry about
everything that the PageSpeed

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.380
tool essentially
is checking for.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.900
So I've split this into two
different sections, display

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.480
and interactions,
and how they relate

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.730
to the kind of
PageSpeed Insights tool.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.490
Display is about how the content
is presented on the device.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.200
And obviously,
interaction is about how

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.656
the user manipulates the
screen and manipulates

00:13:05.656 --> 00:13:07.280
all the content,
whether it's a sign up

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.291
form, whether it's a payment
button and those types

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:10.790
of things.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.790
Because if users can't
interact with your site,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.780
they don't buy things.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.530
They can't log in.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.310
They can't sign up
for your service.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.850
And you have a really
bad time on mobile.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.500
So we look at display.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.890
And I'm going to go through
this pretty quickly.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.550
And I really hate
doing this slide.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.360
But the most important
and critical thing

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.640
that you can do for building
a mobile web experience

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.181
is make sure that
you use a viewport.

00:13:30.181 --> 00:13:32.380
The viewpoint defines
essentially the size

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.750
the content should
be on the screen.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.750
And this is all
recommended configuration,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.030
meta name equals
viewport, content width

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:42.510
equals device width.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.350
Because that essentially allows
you to ensure that everything's

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.170
sized to whether it's 320
pixels on iPhone up to about 380

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.230
on the Nexus 4.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.660
And it basically
means the browser

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.243
doesn't have to scale
the content down

00:13:54.243 --> 00:13:56.380
from a traditional
desktop experience

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.530
into a more mobile experience.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.215
And I think that's a bug
in Chrome at the top.

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:03.090
We'll get from there.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.548
And actually, the
reason why I want

00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:06.810
to show why this is
actually kind of critical

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.884
is that I've taken the way
that the browser renders

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:13.300
desktop content
on a mobile device

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.570
and compared it to
how it's rendered

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.560
on a viewport configured page.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.370
And as you see on
the right-- it's

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.410
probably a little bit
hard for you guys to see.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.940
But that's a
12-point font, which

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.850
means that at arm's
distance, it looks

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.880
like a 12-point font
on a page, essentially,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.070
on a normal piece of paper.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.736
If you don't have a
viewport, it roughly

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:31.280
reads like a five-point font.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.410
It looks like the point where
it's nearly kind of unreadable.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.150
OK, we have retina-based
devices which

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.170
let us distinguish the layout
of the text a little bit better.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.520
But five points is
really not that readable.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.940
Nexus 5 is the same.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.800
Everything is roughly
a third of the size

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.576
of what it's actually
intended to be.

00:14:47.576 --> 00:14:48.950
So a 12-point
font, in this case,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.950
reads like four-point fount.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.740
Nexus 7 obviously is
better, bigger screen

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.948
and all those type of things.

00:14:53.948 --> 00:14:55.520
But it's getting
to the point where

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.590
the text on a default
mobile experience

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.440
or a desktop experience
on a mobile device

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.481
is completely unreadable.

00:15:00.481 --> 00:15:03.940
Seven points is just at the
point of being unreadable.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.040
And obviously a Nexus 10 and
kind of the iPads as well,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.370
it's a lot less noticeable.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.210
Not having a viewport,
you get to the point

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.520
where the text looks
like a nine-point font.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:19.020
Kind of what I told you then was
really a lie, because basically

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.820
browsers try to
compensate for the fact

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.030
that they know that
the desktop web is

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.940
terrible on a mobile device.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.600
So in Chrome's case,
we use text auto-size.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.780
And basically what happens
is, just as the page loads,

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.910
an algorithm goes through
all the text nodes

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.740
and looks to see
what text it should

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.700
resize to make it more visible.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.440
And on some pages, like my
blog before, it's not too bad.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.020
The content at the
top of the page

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.230
is made bigger because
that's the primary focus.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.730
But then you get
to sites like this,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.690
which is Hacker News, which is
the same page as we saw before.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.780
There's certain comments
which read really well,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.220
like the browser's gone,
yeah, this looks important.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.440
It's not semantic analysis.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.582
It's just kind of
some basic heuristic.

00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:01.540
But then there's other
bits, like in the middle

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.780
here, which you
can't read the text.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.910
You can't read the text here.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.540
You can't read the
text on the device.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.640
You have to zoom in.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.042
So the algorithm isn't perfect.

00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:09.500
And the best way
to get around that

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.550
is to start to design for a
mobile web based experience.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.387
Obviously, user
viewport, there are

00:16:15.387 --> 00:16:17.720
little hacks to kind of get
around it by making sure you

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.272
[INAUDIBLE] over
100,000 pixels high.

00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:22.230
It's not even worth going
there, because that's

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.605
just one of those things which
might change in the future

00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:25.790
when people get rid of that.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.862
But essentially, browsers
try to compensate.

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.570
And when the browser
tries to compensate,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.929
it kind of starts to ruin
your design essentially.

00:16:31.929 --> 00:16:33.470
It doesn't represent
how you actually

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.490
intended the user to
read your content.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.480
And obviously, fit the
content to the viewport.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.750
There's not actually
anything technical

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.530
that we can say about this.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.613
It's just make sure
everything is sized correctly,

00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:45.496
and there's no kind of
horizontal scrolling.

00:16:45.496 --> 00:16:46.620
Vertical scrolling is fine.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.870
And horizontal scrolling is
actually fine by default.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.410
But if you have to have the
user pan in multiple directions,

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.535
that's when users actually
start to get frustrated.

00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:55.920
And I'll share the link later
on where the Ads team have

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.070
done this analysis to actually
show that users don't like it.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.000
But the interesting
thing is that scrolling

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.410
varies from platform
to platform.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.190
And iOS, at one point--
I think it probably still

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.650
does-- used to
have a scroll lock.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.149
So if you're kind of moving up
in the vertical orientation,

00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:10.190
you can't scroll left and
right at the same time,

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.589
because it's saying, well,
you don't want to pan around.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.960
You want to just look
at the content itself.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.079
But we want to get away
from this situation

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.755
where you have to actually
move around the web like that.

00:17:19.755 --> 00:17:20.630
I do have a question.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.860
Who's got a 24-inch phone?

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.359
No?

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.170
Oh, OK.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.220
That was really
heavy, by the way.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.020
It was crazy.

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.830
So I'm not going
to tell everyone

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.544
about this too much,
like media queries.

00:17:34.544 --> 00:17:35.960
We should be kind
of concentrating

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.340
on mobile first design,
responsive design as well.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.910
Obviously, you can
design your site

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.700
to work better on
portrait or landscape

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.485
and a whole load of other stuff.

00:17:45.485 --> 00:17:46.860
This is one of
those areas that's

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.340
super critical for
web development.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.294
You want to be looking at how
you actually design your site

00:17:51.294 --> 00:17:52.710
to be responsive,
rather than have

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:53.920
to do it all in the server.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.294
It's best to do
it on the client.

00:17:55.294 --> 00:17:57.447
I'm not going to go into
it too much, because I'm

00:17:57.447 --> 00:17:59.030
pretty sure everyone
knows about this.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.320
The thing I want to
do say is about how

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.460
you decide the break
points in your site.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:07.270
And Paul Lewis has been working
on a redesign for HTML5Rocks,

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.390
which is our
documentation resource.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.010
And the old site looks cool.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.780
The new site looks cool.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.890
But what happened is on the
original site on the left,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.650
we basically tried
to size for devices.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.100
So every other week, we would
look at Google Analytics

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.320
to understand the
different types of devices

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.650
that were available or
accessing our content

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.130
and whether it was
a tablet device

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.250
or whether it was
a mobile device.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.833
And then we would
say, well, this kind

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.220
of looks like a tablet size.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.627
We'll push them to the
tablet user interface.

00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:34.710
This looks like a desktop.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.730
We'll push them to
the desktop interface.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.063
And what we found, by rather
than actually concentrating

00:18:39.063 --> 00:18:42.010
on the devices, whether it's
iPhone, Android, or whatever

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.310
and the device form factors,
we literally just tried

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.060
to say that, well,
actually, we'll

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.700
scale the content
out left and right.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.908
And we'll decide where the
break points are based off

00:18:49.908 --> 00:18:52.330
how the content looks
at that individual time.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.830
So it basically was
saying, you size

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.980
the break points to the
content, rather than

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.180
the actual devices,
which a lot of people do.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.560
And we were just as guilty of
doing that as everyone else.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.640
The reason why we say this is
because we went from 17 media

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.156
queries-- our media queries
for the HTML5Rocks site, if you

00:19:08.156 --> 00:19:11.486
go and check it now, is
just an absolute mess.

00:19:11.486 --> 00:19:12.860
And it's really
hard to maintain.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.401
And you get into
this weird situation

00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:16.120
when it doesn't
actually-- we've got

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.940
weird overlapping media queries.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.077
It doesn't actually
know what interface

00:19:20.077 --> 00:19:22.160
it's supposed to present
to users at any one time.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.800
So we went from 17
media queries down

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.760
to something which is a lot
more manageable for us, four.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.920
And we have nice looking
content on desktop,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.719
mobile, and tablet as well.

00:19:31.719 --> 00:19:34.010
One of the other areas that
we're kind of talking about

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.112
is font readability.

00:19:35.112 --> 00:19:37.070
And I looked at the human
interface guidelines.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.630
And this is the whole
PageSpeed Insights

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.150
test, the legibility test.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.246
And the human interface
guidelines from Apple

00:19:43.246 --> 00:19:44.620
are really cool
because they say,

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.820
if users can't read your
text or the word in your app,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.460
it doesn't matter how
beautiful your typography is.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.490
And this kind of is--
it's ultimately applicable

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.073
regardless of whether
you're designing

00:19:54.073 --> 00:19:58.810
paper-based content or web-based
content or content inside apps.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.340
And our guidelines and the way
that the PageSpeed Insights

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.620
tool works is it
tries to say, you

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.980
should be sizing your text to
be readable at arm's distance.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.660
Numerous studies, whether it's
Apple, Microsoft, or Google

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.024
as well, 12-point
font is the minimum

00:20:13.024 --> 00:20:14.440
that you want to
suggest, which is

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.835
roughly one em or roughly
16 pixels in height.

00:20:17.835 --> 00:20:19.210
But the interesting
thing as well

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.710
is that we're
actually trying to say

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.450
that what you should
be doing as well

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.360
is consider where the user
actually uses your content.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.177
They might be out in a cab
or walking down the street.

00:20:28.177 --> 00:20:29.760
And you want to make
sure that there's

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.200
a decent amount of contrast
between the foreground

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.400
color and the background
color as well.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.900
We don't actually
analyze that yet,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.316
and we're trying to work out
whether these types of things

00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:40.647
are important or not for you
as a mobile web developer when

00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:41.730
you're checking your site.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.021
And obviously, things like
maintain decent line heights

00:20:44.021 --> 00:20:46.010
so that the text
is readable and you

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.714
don't have to get confused
between the lines.

00:20:49.714 --> 00:20:51.630
Yeah, so font readability
is kind of critical.

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.130
And that's one of
the things that we

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.950
look for when we're doing
the PageSpeed Insights tool.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.520
We also want to kind of--
we don't check for this,

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:02.020
but we're trying to get people
to limit the use of web fonts

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.980
at the moment, especially
on a mobile device.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.355
Because if the web font doesn't
exist either in the cache

00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:09.030
or on the user's device,
then essentially-- especially

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.517
on WebKit-based browsers
and Blink-based browsers--

00:21:11.517 --> 00:21:14.100
you're left waiting around for
the content to actually appear,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.980
because the font doesn't exist.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.152
So it doesn't actually appear
on the site at the time.

00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:20.860
And our guidance at
the moment-- and this

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.020
might change once browser
implementations change,

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.170
essentially-- is just
to use it for headings.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.880
But critical content,
like the text--

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.970
like if it's HTML5 Rocks,
the article body content

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.540
would just be a normal
system-wide font essentially.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.910
The interesting thing to
say is Paul Irish had a post

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:40.064
on Google+ talking about
the flash of one style text

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:42.230
essentially, where we're
talking about the different

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.640
implementations
between browsers.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.389
So obviously, WebKit
and Blink are kind of

00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:47.850
quite consistent because they're
both of the same heritage

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.100
where the content
doesn't appear.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.920
Whereas, Firefox is a
little bit different.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.250
I believe the text
appears as a system font,

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.920
essentially, until the actual
web font is downloaded.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.860
And we're looking for
your feedback about what

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.109
you think is the most important
thing, because we want

00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:04.994
to make sure that if we want
to be good web citizens,

00:22:04.994 --> 00:22:06.410
and everyone wants
to get this, we

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.642
have the same type of
implementation across browsers.

00:22:08.642 --> 00:22:10.850
And it might be at some
point that the actual Firefox

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.350
implementation is
the preferred one.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.725
But obviously, we need a lot
of feedback from developers.

00:22:14.725 --> 00:22:15.570
So go to that post.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.820
Have a look at the
suggestions, and then let

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.120
Paul and everyone
else know how you

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.184
want to have web fonts
presented to the user.

00:22:23.184 --> 00:22:24.600
I'll tweet this
link out because I

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.000
know it's not exactly visible.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.979
So that's display.

00:22:27.979 --> 00:22:29.395
I want to talk
about interactions,

00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:30.910
and I'm going to
be really quick.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.710
Click disambiguation
is really important,

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.190
because essentially the
user-- this is Chrome.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.223
When the user clicks on
an area inside Chrome,

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:39.630
and it doesn't know
exactly where the user is,

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.000
it presents a magnifying glass.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.458
It's a great
accessibility feature.

00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:45.140
The problem is, though, that it
actually presents a challenge

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.690
to users because there's an
extra step before they actually

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.620
do anything.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.360
So we want you as a developer
to try and get away from that.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.500
And I'm going to roughly
go through the process

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.030
for this, how this actual
disambiguation works.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:59.215
Essentially, the user clicks
on the screen, roughly

00:22:59.215 --> 00:23:00.880
a 48 pixel bounding box.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.960
Works out where
the click is, adds

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.704
in an area kind of like an
error buffer around the side,

00:23:05.704 --> 00:23:07.620
finds all the targets
inside the bounding box,

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.460
the potential candidates
for what the user actually

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.000
meant to click, scores each
element based on the closeness

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.180
to the original touch.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.250
In this case, finds
one that's the closest.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.610
That's the closest element.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.360
And then it basically
compares the scores

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.820
across all the rest
of the elements

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.300
and then tries to find
the elements where

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.930
the distance between
the original touch

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.140
is roughly about half the
distance to the closest

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.640
element.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.320
It's relatively complex.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.660
The code, if you're interested
in Chrome, is over there.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:36.935
The simplest answer is just
to use sensible padding.

00:23:36.935 --> 00:23:38.810
You're building a site,
just don't be stupid.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.226
Space elements out
pretty quickly,

00:23:40.226 --> 00:23:42.100
which leads us on to
this whole idea about,

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.122
what are interesting
tap targets?

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:46.330
All the different types of
human interface guidelines

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.280
talk about things which aren't
native to the web, points

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.200
obviously for fonts.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.220
But dips on Android?

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.560
What's a dip?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.810
Microsoft is nine millimeters.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.280
I don't know how that
really applies to the web.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.880
But roughly, if you take one
CSS pixel as standard reference

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.000
to be a 96th of an
inch, you can roughly

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.450
work out that
everything is around

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.959
between 29 and 33
pixels in size.

00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:07.500
Our recommendation in the tool
that we're using at the moment

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.060
is around 26 pixels but
with a decent amount

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.367
of padding We're
recommending eight CSS pixels

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:14.450
or roughly about two
millimeters worth of padding.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.830
And that helps the disambiguator
not have to reselect which--

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.136
or kind of basically pop up.

00:24:20.136 --> 00:24:21.760
The other interesting
thing around this

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.920
as well is that if
you're trying to get data

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.970
put into your
system interaction,

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.490
you're getting users to sign
up to your app or your site,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.005
you want to have
form inputs that

00:24:30.005 --> 00:24:33.200
are easy to read and
easy to enter data.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.100
Labels are the thing.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.979
You should always go for this.

00:24:36.979 --> 00:24:39.270
Basically, the reason why
labels are actually important

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.350
is because in this case it's
doubling the amount of touch

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.880
size that is
available for the user

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.990
to actually be able to
focus the input element.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.680
Now obviously, you can style
your site however you want.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.730
But in this case here,
I've got the top element

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.688
and the bottom element.

00:24:52.688 --> 00:24:55.080
Both are touchable, and both
focus the same input box

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.050
as well.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.221
So it's relatively simple.

00:24:57.221 --> 00:24:58.970
Obviously, it's up to
you how you actually

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.530
decide how it's styled.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.484
But it's one nice little
thing that I quite like.

00:25:03.484 --> 00:25:05.150
Who actually likes
waiting in the queue?

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:05.800
I mean, I'm British.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.300
I do.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.512
I love waiting in queues.

00:25:07.512 --> 00:25:08.970
This is me trying
to get to Berlin.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:10.970
I patiently waited in
this queue for three hours

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.034
without complaining
at all to anyone.

00:25:14.034 --> 00:25:15.450
And then I got to
the front, and I

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.970
apologized for
missing my flight.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.850
And it wasn't me who
missed the-- anyway, it's

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.180
kind of like waiting
300-millisecond click delay.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.750
The 300-millisecond
click delay is this thing

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.780
to help us kind of--
oops, sorry-- get the user

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.090
to zoom into the content
for a desktop type display.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:33.930
Now it slows down interactions.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.180
Everyone knows it's horrible.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.550
We don't really
complain too much.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.070
It'd be great if we could kind
of remove that from the web.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.910
I do have a kind
of question though.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.159
And this is styled off the
Google interview questions,

00:25:44.159 --> 00:25:46.802
which we know are great
at hiring candidates.

00:25:46.802 --> 00:25:48.260
How much time do
we waste every day

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.510
with a 300-millisecond
click delay?

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.980
Has anyone got a guess?

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.522
Right, I have no idea.

00:25:55.522 --> 00:25:56.980
That's what everyone
says when they

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.300
get asked these
stupid questions.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:58.930
I have no idea.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.020
What a stupid question.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.530
But actually, I do
know for Wikipedia.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.142
Wikipedia actually publish
all their mobile traffic.

00:26:08.142 --> 00:26:10.100
They get roughly about
3 billion requests a day

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.420
on mobile, which is 1,400
requests per second, which

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:18.500
is 423 wasted seconds every
second just on Wikipedia alone,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.510
which roughly equates to one
year wasted every day just

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.415
waiting around for
your click to complete.

00:26:27.187 --> 00:26:28.020
So it's pretty cool.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.853
Chrome is removing the
300-millisecond click

00:26:29.853 --> 00:26:31.120
delay, which is great news.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:36.030
And I'm going to
talk about what we're

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.890
going to do because it's not
going to be for everyone.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:39.110
And it's great for links.

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.990
I don't know whether this
actually came across very well.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.167
It looks like the videos
aren't playing properly.

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:44.000
You click on a link.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.666
You don't have to
wait 300 milliseconds.

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:47.960
But as you saw before,
if it takes 10 seconds

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.870
to load your page, the
300-millisecond saving

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.130
that you get is not--
you've got bigger fish

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:55.250
to fry essentially if your
network requests are that slow.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.770
But it's great for interactions.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.480
And Jake Archibald
made this video.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.449
On the left is the
300-millisecond click delay.

00:27:00.449 --> 00:27:02.490
On the right it's a
zero-millisecond click delay.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.960
Everything just feels
a lot more responsive.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.630
You click on a button or
check box, or in this case

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.259
it's a link-- you click anything
that has a click handler,

00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:11.300
it happens straight away.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.774
It just feels a lot more
natural and reactive.

00:27:13.774 --> 00:27:15.190
So how would you
go about removing

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.523
the 300-millisecond click delay?

00:27:16.523 --> 00:27:18.360
It's not killed for everything.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.390
The simple answer--
and it relates

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.030
to one of the very first
slides, user viewport--

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.760
make sure the width
equals device width.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.510
But also size the
content in the viewport.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:28.320
If we don't have to
pan left and right,

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.528
then we've got a really
strong indication of the fact

00:27:30.528 --> 00:27:33.320
that the user will not have
to zoom in to the page.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.077
So if we don't have
to zoom in, why

00:27:35.077 --> 00:27:36.910
actually do the double
tap to click gesture?

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.470
Pinch to zoom will still
work, but double tap to click,

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.200
we don't really need.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.260
Or use FastClick.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.360
I know some of the FT
Labs guys are here today.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.776
If you're not on Chrome, you
can use the FastClick library

00:27:46.776 --> 00:27:50.030
to kind of get around some of
those interaction problems.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.350
Who loves typing on a phone?

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.850
Yeah, good.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.290
Because no one loves
typing on a phone at all.

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.390
The goal that we want to
try and get developers to

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.056
is just to minimize
the amount of typing

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:01.350
that you have to force
your users through.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.726
Obviously, this
is really simple.

00:28:02.726 --> 00:28:04.558
I hate talking about
this slide because it's

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:05.710
been around for years.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.920
It's just, take advantage
of specialized keyboards

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.069
on mobile devices.

00:28:09.069 --> 00:28:11.110
If it's an email address--
say it's, type email--

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.340
you'll get an at sign.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.459
If it's a date or a
number-- so if it's

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:16.500
a telephone number-- say
it's a telephone number,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.310
you get a special dial pad.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.350
If it's a number, you
get a special number pad.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:24.200
If it's a date, you get a
special date entry button.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.730
Now, it doesn't
speed up the time

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.316
to actually complete
the form, but it

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:30.440
does increase the accuracy.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.210
And I did some completely
non-scientific tests,

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.072
so I'm obviously a
good authority on this.

00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:38.280
And some of the tests that
I did where I asked people

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.870
to enter certain kind
of data, basically it

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:47.380
was like 95% accuracy at
the time for the input types

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.630
because it was so constrained.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.150
Now, that's completely
unscientific,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.230
so don't go about
quoting that one.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.670
But everyone knows, when they
see the correct input type,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.710
they like it.

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:57.484
Also take advantage
of autocomplete.

00:28:57.484 --> 00:28:59.400
The browsers are actually
pretty good at this.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.025
And then if you look
at Stack Overflow,

00:29:01.025 --> 00:29:02.530
everyone seems to hate it.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.120
But you want to try and get
your users not entering data

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.870
if it's already stored
inside the browser.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.830
And the way you get
autocomplete to work

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.660
is to use names for the
field labels that are similar

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.420
or that are well
known, essentially.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.400
So if you want to get
the first name, f name.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.150
If you want to get
the surname, l name.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.870
The email address,
obviously name equals email.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.850
Those type of things,
they just help the user.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.970
If it kind of auto starts
autocomplete, you press it.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:27.680
The form's completed
really quickly.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.650
And it's zero cost
for you as a developer

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.310
to actually implement.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:34.020
The next is requestAutoComplete.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:36.210
So who's heard of
requestAutoComplete?

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:37.910
A couple of people, really cool.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.640
Basically, the
idea behind this is

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.510
to have a programmatic access
to the form autocomplete.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.430
And now this another
video by Jake.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.172
It's a really good video.

00:29:48.172 --> 00:29:49.330
Or a demo by Jake.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.740
Essentially, you have an API
which uses an existing form.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.310
You call.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.990
You can basically
go, I want to check

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.720
to see if
requestAutoComplete exists.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.452
If it doesn't, you
present the original form

00:29:59.452 --> 00:30:01.660
so that people can just go
straight through and enter

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.110
the data in.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.600
If it does exist, you can call
a requestAutoComplete, which

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.360
pops up the box
that we saw before,

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.150
lets the users
select their data,

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:11.600
maybe also if you're in the US,
autocomplete the credit card

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.835
with Google Wallet.

00:30:12.835 --> 00:30:14.876
And then you can go through
and complete the form

00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:16.800
and submit really quickly.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.270
The aim is to really
improve the time

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.512
to submission for form data.

00:30:21.512 --> 00:30:22.970
If you have to
enter this manually,

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.531
it's two minutes
just entering text

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:26.530
to get your shipping
address and billing address

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.750
and a whole load of other stuff.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.166
And we want to get
away from that.

00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:31.850
So the requestAutoComplete
API is there.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.820
And I'm going to
start wrapping up now.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.654
Our goal is to get
as much feedback

00:30:36.654 --> 00:30:37.820
at the moment for this tool.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.260
So please go out and check
the PageSpeed Insights tool.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:48.519
Put ux=1 at the end, and you'll
get the actual tools available.

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:49.810
And I'd like to thank everyone.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.550
I know I've run
over a little bit.

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.820
mobile-ux.appspot.com
is these slides.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.570
html5rocks.com/mobile is our
mobile documentation entry

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.070
point.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.830
Thank you.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:05.931
