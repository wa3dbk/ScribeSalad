00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.255
JUSTIN BOYAN: Great.

00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:05.970
Hey, everybody, how you doing?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.770
Everybody having fun?

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.830
We're having fun.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:09.810
I'm Justin Boyan.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.340
I'm a product manager in the
Google Cambridge, Mass office.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.460
JOSH AIN: And I'm Josh Ain.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.280
I'm a software engineer,
also in the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.080
Google Cambridge office.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.670
JUSTIN BOYAN: And we are going
to do a deep dive into four

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.030
tools that Google is providing
to help webmasters and people

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.370
who author HTML provide a
structured view of their data

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.840
to Google and other
search engines.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.410
So before we get started, how
many of you actually have a

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.650
website or work for an

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.840
organization that has a website?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.930
Who the heck doesn't
have a website?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.600
How many of you have
written HTML for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.650
that website or others?

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.810
Every kid these days knows
how to write HTML.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.040
Now, how many of you have
included structured

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.160
markup in that HTML?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.930
Microformats, microdata,
RDFa, OGP?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.570
About half.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.810
Perfect.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.390
So that's what we're seeing
on the web, as well.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.300
And this talk we're going to
cover two kinds of tools.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
Tools for those of you who have
already put structured

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.020
markup into your HTML, and those
of you who haven't yet

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.080
and need a little boost
getting started.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.780
So four tools we're going
to demo are--

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
for those of you who already
have structured markup, the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.580
Structured Data Testing Tool,
the Structured Data Dashboard.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.390
And then for those of you who
are just getting started with

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.720
providing structured data on
your websites, the Data

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.470
Highlighter tool, which is
launched yesterday with seven

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.870
additional data types, and the
Structured Data Markup Helper,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.860
an all new tool that
launched yesterday.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.660
So just if you missed the last
session, I'm going to briefly

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.490
recap why are you interested
in providing a structured

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.430
semantic view of your
data to Google?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.460
And it's because Google is going
well beyond the plain

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.430
vanilla 10 blue links in
response to search.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.150
We want to provide answers,
anticipation, and enhanced

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.270
presentation of the results,
which we can do if we

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.410
understand the structure of the
data on your web pages.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.270
So for starters, there
are rich snippets.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.240
If you provide structured
information about your event

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.130
listings or your product
listings, your recipes, the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.350
review content on your sites,
and other similar data

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.670
formats, we can highlight your
search results with enhanced

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.760
treatment that helps
users find what

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.400
they're looking for quicker.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.710
For recipes, we go a bit further
and actually provide

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.910
search tools that allow users to
filter the results based on

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.410
the structured content
in your pages.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.200
So certainly, if you're
searching for chocolate chip

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.260
cookie recipe, you want to
exclude the recipes with

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.900
pecans and walnuts because
that's an atrocity.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.780
And we provide you the ability
to do that powered by

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.580
structured markup
in web pages.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.490
We are integrating with the
Knowledge Graph, so if you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.600
provide reviews of movies, say,
when a user searches for

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.650
a movie we can highlight that
data right in front and center

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.190
in the knowledge graph
presentation for that movie.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.920
And for events, we've got
a lot of treatments.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.190
So launching just a couple
days ago, is this events

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.170
carousel, we call it.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.880
Somebody comes in searching
for events in a city--

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.410
I believe this was launched
US only--

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.970
we feature a nice carousel
of the most popular

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.920
events in that city.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.960
We also, as Jason showed last
session, we'll blend in events

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.490
from web data into searches
for a band or for a venue.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.190
And these event data items are
also showing up in mobile

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.440
interfaces like Google Now.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.380
So to make your data eligible
to participate in all these

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.010
cool enhanced search treatments,
you need us to

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280
understand the structure
of the data.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.010
And there are many ways
of doing that.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.080
Our number one recommendation
is to use microdata with

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.330
schema.org vocabulary.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.010
What do you think?

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.649
Is that easy enough?

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.490
JOSH AIN: Looks difficult
to me, Justin.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.310
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, it's not
that bad, but we do recognize

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.690
there are many competing
formats.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.260
There are microformats,
microdata, RDFa, OGP, et

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.660
cetera, and it can be confusing
for webmasters to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.760
know exactly what they're
supposed to do and what

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.720
they're supposed to provide.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.510
So that's where our team is
working hard to try to make

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.930
things easier.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.830
So let's get into the demos.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.010
We'll start with the two tools
that help you check existing

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.880
markup that you've already
applied to web pages.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.040
The structured data testing
tool, this is the situation

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.330
where you have a single web
page, you want to check if

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.040
you've applied markup
the right way.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.240
It's a validation tool.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.720
Anybody can go use this tool.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.360
You don't even need
to be logged in.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.090
You go to the Webmaster Tools
Rich Snippets site, paste in

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.720
the URL or actually, the source
HTML of your page, and

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.750
Google will show you what we
understand of the structured

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.410
data on that page.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.630
So to demonstrate this tool I
have brought on the pretend

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.450
webmaster for a local museum,
the San Francisco Museum of

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.720
Modern Art.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.800
We don't actually have a
preexisting relationship with

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.280
SFMOMA, but just for demo
purposes, Josh will pretend to

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.790
be the SFMOMA webmaster.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.040
JOSH AIN: One second.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.370
So hello.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.660
As you can clearly see by my
hat, I'm the webmaster of the

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.910
San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:55.800
Just kidding.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.110
I don't actually have any
knowledge of whether the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.790
webmaster of San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art wears a

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.920
hat like this or does any of the
other things I'm going to

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.340
do, but for the purpose of
motivating this example I'm

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.700
talking about the motivations
of this webmaster.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.540
So I have events going on at
the San Francisco Museum of

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.720
Modern Art and I would like to
make sure that as many people

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.750
as possible know about these
upcoming events.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.600
If you're staying in town next
week after Google I/O or if

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.870
you live here, we've got a
great event going on, the

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.250
Agent Ruby files.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.370
This is based on an AI
art and exploration

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.490
project that goes on.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.870
And I think it's really
interesting.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.610
So if you're here, you
should check it out.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.550
I want to make sure everybody
knows about that, and I want

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.910
Google to share details
about this event.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.210
JUSTIN BOYAN: But we're
not showing rich

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.720
snippets for that event.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.230
JOSH AIN: Right, we're not
showing rich snippets right

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.370
now, I know that.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.670
And I want to figure out why.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.940
So I've already added
structured

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.250
markup to this page.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.340
And I'm going to take the URL
of this event and go over to

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.160
the Google Structured Data
Testing tool and

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.300
paste in this URL.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.220
I could also paste in
HTML if I hadn't

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.070
published the URL yet.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.600
And I'll say Preview.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.200
So here, I see the search
treatment which I already know

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.620
I'm getting for the event.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.500
And it's just a normal
search result.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.620
There's nothing event-specific
about it.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.680
If I scroll down further, I can
see that Google does pick

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.060
up the structured data that I've
added to the site, so why

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.580
isn't my event showing up?

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, you've got
your microformats there.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.110
You've shown the start date and
summary and description of

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.210
the event, but you haven't given
us a location we can

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.230
understand.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.180
JOSH AIN: Ah, so here I can
learn that I need to add the

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.950
location and then maybe I
can get event treatment.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.130
Let's try that out.

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.140
JUSTIN BOYAN: So if the real
webmaster of SFMOMA were to go

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.950
back and fix up the microformat
to connect in the

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.490
location properly, then
re-previewing in the

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.070
Structured Data Testing
tool would show that--

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.110
there you go-- the rich snippet
line, which shows

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.270
clearly the date and location
of that event.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.370
And also, seeing that preview in
the rich snippet will also

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.450
indicate that Google has
understood the data in a way

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.570
that's usable and makes the
event eligible for all the

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.450
other search presentations
of events.

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:13.800
JOSH AIN: There we go.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.420
That's much better.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.090
That's exactly what I want.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.110
Thanks.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.620
JUSTIN BOYAN: We'll move on to
the Structured Data Dashboard.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.570
So this goes beyond single
page validation.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.110
Here again, you are a webmaster
who has already

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.280
applied markup to your site,
perhaps over a variety of

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.929
different pages and a variety
of different types.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.940
And you would like to understand
holistically

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.760
whether Google is picking
up your data correctly.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.289
So log into Webmaster Tools,
which you need

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.710
to be verified for.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.880
And go to the Structured
Data Dashboard.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.190
To demonstrate that, I'll bring

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:51.900
back my SFMOMA webmaster.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.040
JOSH AIN: Hello, I'm still the
webmaster at San Francisco

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.150
Museum of Modern Art.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.840
And I'm going to go into my
Structured Data Dashboard.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.610
Here it is.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.750
I'm already a verified
webmaster

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.330
of my site, of course.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.950
And I can see Google's
understanding of the

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.070
structured data on my
site over time.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.010
So I haven't made any
significant changes to my

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.680
structured data recently, and
that's why these lines are

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.240
pretty flat.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.960
But if I just added a lot of
structured data, you could see

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.880
when Google re-crawls the site
and when Google picks it up.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.180
I can also see what
Google knows.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.270
Google knows about 23 and 1/2
thousand items split over 15

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.440
and 1/2 thousand pages.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.710
And they're split into two
different types of structured

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.000
data, hCards, or contact
information, and

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.080
hCalendars, or events.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.300
And I've got 9,000 events.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.770
If I want more details on
Google's understanding, I can

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.220
just drill in here and see a
bunch of different example

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.480
pages that have hCalendars
and Google's

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.080
interpretation of them.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.320
Now, to go back to the example
we were looking at, I know

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.450
that the URL of the Agent Ruby
files ends in 2295, because as

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:01.660
a good webmaster,
I've memorized

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.690
every URL on my website.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:07.090
And so I have the Agent
Ruby files.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.370
I can see that that's
the same page we

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.890
were looking at earlier.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:15.000
And when I click on it, we'll
bring up the details.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.640
Here they are.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.640
We'll bring up the details of
Google's understanding.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.960
So, similar to what I saw
earlier in the testing tool,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.590
only now I can easily see it on
lots of different pages one

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.260
after another.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.850
JUSTIN BOYAN: So it's
essentially like applying the

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.890
Structured Data Testing tool
to your whole site

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.340
simultaneously and getting
an overview.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.690
And right now the Dashboard
team is hard at work

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.310
integrating error information in
a really nice way into that

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.020
Dashboard display.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.900
You'll be seeing that roll out
early this summer, I hope,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.200
although we don't like to
pre-announce things.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.580
But here's a mock of what
it's going to look like.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.690
So it features quite clearly
along the top row what

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.980
different classes of errors
we've observed in your

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.480
structured data markup, and then
we surface those pages

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.300
with errors on them
to the top.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.690
So the idea is to really help
webmasters debug problems in

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.020
their markup so that Google
can understand it clearly.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.320
So that concludes the first
half of tools that we're

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.390
providing to people who
are already using

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.810
markup on their pages.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.310
Now, let's shift gears to those
of you who don't yet

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.620
have markup and aren't yet
explaining your structured

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.230
data to Google.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.100
How do you get Google--

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.220
how do you start participating
in all the enhanced features

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.680
that structured data enables?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.420
We're going to show two
fancy and slick tools.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.820
The first is Data Highlighter.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.710
Data Highlighter launched
in December for events.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.680
As of yesterday, it is now
available for seven additional

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.950
types of data, almost all of the
rich snippet data formats

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.530
that Google supports.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.550
Data Highlighter is a tool
that's, like the Dashboard,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.890
built into Webmaster Tools,
and allows you, without

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.090
actually changing the HTML of
your pages at all, to get a

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.200
taste of what structured markup
could do for you.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.700
So how can Google get an
understanding of your

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.430
structured data without you
editing your HTML at all?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:15.382
It works by machine learning
and a point and click UI.

00:12:15.382 --> 00:12:19.730
So you actually start with a
sample page that contains the

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.350
kind of data you would like
Google to understand.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.400
You apply a point and click
tagging operation to label the

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.130
key data fields on
those pages.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.810
And then Google extrapolates the
pattern of the tags that

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.080
you've applied to other similar
pages on your website.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.930
So we'll have Josh demonstrate
how the Data

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.020
Highlighter tool works.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.060
But let's bring in a different
webmaster.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.070
I'd like to call up the
webmaster of the 826 Valencia

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.690
Pirate Supply Store.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.270
JOSH AIN: Hold on.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.520
Let me get him.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.430
Arr.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.620
I'm the webmaster of 826
Valencia, San Francisco's only

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.290
independent pirate
supply store.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.880
And so I hope if you have any
pirate supply needs while

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.750
you're in town, you
know where to go.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.030
As an independent--

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.980
now, again, I'm not really
the webmaster.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.460
This is just for example,
explaining how somebody might

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.490
use this tool.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.830
So I'm a busy shop owner.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.570
I don't have a lot of time
to go and add every

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.990
feature to my website.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.550
What I care about is making
sure people know about my

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.510
store, know what's in stock,
and know about

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.660
my important events.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.160
So Talk Like a Pirate Day is
coming right up and people

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.270
need their pirate
gear for that.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.150
I want to make sure that they
can find all of my products on

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.490
Google when I do that.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.830
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take my URL--

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.600
a URL for one of my favorite
products, the Hook--

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.400
copy it, and go into Webmaster
Tools Data Highlighter.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.050
So that's just under
Optimization.

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.310
And I'm a verified webmaster,
of course.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.050
But I just don't have time
to add all of the

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.120
markup to my page.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.940
I'm going to train Google
how to fetch the data.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.580
So I'm going to paste the URL
in for my hook and choose a

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.080
type of data I want
to highlight.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.260
So this is a product.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.160
I want to tell people
how to buy it.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.840
And I want to tag this page
and others like it.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.820
I just want to tag all the
product pages on my site.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.950
So let's get started.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.360
JUSTIN BOYAN: So once you've
told us about that first

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.960
sample URL, we're going to
load the page in and

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.990
instrument it for this point and
click tagging operation.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.920
JOSH AIN: So I can see, here
on the right are the fields

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.240
that Google's interested
in about a product.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.820
So a name, an image,
price information.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.640
And here's my web page, along
with some guidance on what I

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.030
have to do to share this data.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.340
So I'm going to just highlight
this hook,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.970
the name of my product.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.920
And then I get this interface
that lets me tell Google what

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.260
this data means.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:57.900
So this is the name
of my product.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.264
Down here we have a price.

00:15:02.264 --> 00:15:05.590
And here's an image
for my hook.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.190
And I think that's enough
information.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.480
There's other fields, but I
don't have ratings or reviews

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.950
on my site, so I think
that's enough.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.325
I'll click Done.

00:15:15.325 --> 00:15:16.500
What's this, Justin?

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.990
JUSTIN BOYAN: At this point,
we're looking at the structure

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.310
of your website and finding a
URL pattern that seems to

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.760
contain similarly formatted
web pages.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.250
And so in this case, we're
guessing that the slash store

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.010
slash product slash star might
be the set of pages that

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.210
you're interested in
sharing with us.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.300
JOSH AIN: So as any good
webmaster or shop owner knows,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.770
I know all the URLs on my
website, and I know that all

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.920
of my products fall under
that pattern, so it

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.415
looks great to me.

00:15:43.415 --> 00:15:46.340
I'm going to create a page
set and keep going.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.940
JUSTIN BOYAN: Now, at this
point, we're going to suggest

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.600
a few more examples of pages
from within that URL pattern

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.870
and get him to confirm
that we've

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.320
understood them correctly.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.710
We'll try and look for pages
that maybe don't fit the

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.840
pattern, are formatted
a little differently.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.610
JOSH AIN: So here I can see the
powder horn, which is $38.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.550
And the data that I expect is
showing up here on the right,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.290
indicating Google's
understanding.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.180
Looks good to me.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.770
I'll click Next.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.370
The seahose.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.100
Also looks like Google
understands what that means.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.040
I'll click Next.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.240
Holiday card bundle.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.146
Looks good to me.

00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:26.280
And individual signs.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.970
Yep, just $4.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.340
So I guess I'm done with
five examples.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.460
JUSTIN BOYAN: It doesn't always
go that smoothly, but

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.540
you're training a pattern
recognition system.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.500
So if your site has more
variability than this one, you

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:42.500
may have to clear some of our
incorrectly guessed tags and

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.960
correctly reapply those tags.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.040
But generally, after five or
sometimes 10 pages, we will

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.420
have understood your pattern and
you can click through to

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.620
the next phase.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:53.005
JOSH AIN: Great.

00:16:53.005 --> 00:16:55.740
I'll click Done and
keep going.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.200
JUSTIN BOYAN: So this
is the final review.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.860
We provide a wider sample of
pages that you can quickly

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.730
skim through, just to check.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.920
Again, sanity check that we're
pulling the right information

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.980
from the set of pages
you gave us.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.040
JOSH AIN: So, I see.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.869
I can just review all
of these pages.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.089
And all of these look like the
products I have in stock.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.690
It doesn't look like Google
has made any mistakes.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:19.849
So I'm done.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
hit Publish.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.460
And that will actually install
the pattern recognition into

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.319
the Google crawling algorithms,
so that in the

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.790
future as we gather updated
information from your site we

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.160
will interpret that structured
data as if you had applied

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.070
markup to the pages directly.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.060
JOSH AIN: But when do
I get snippets?

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.900
I want to make sure that I
have them for Talk Like a

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.820
Pirate Day.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.960
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, as we
re-crawl your site, those

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.680
snippets will start appearing.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.980
I think talk like a
Pirate Day is--

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.330
when?

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.980
JOSH AIN: September.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.350
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
you'll be fine.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.900
JOSH AIN: Great.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.150
Thanks a lot, Justin.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.740
JUSTIN BOYAN: So again, Data
Highlighter, as of yesterday,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.500
supports eight types of data.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.450
That's in addition to events,
articles, local businesses,

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.430
movies and movie reviews,
products, as you just saw,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:10.210
restaurants, software
applications, and TV episodes.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.910
So if your website has any of
those kinds of data on it, you

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.550
can get a quick jump into the
world of structured data by

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.580
applying Data Highlighter,
as you just saw.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:25.830
You don't even need to modify
your actual website.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.970
Of course, there's a downside
to using Data Highlighter,

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.730
which is only Google will have
that pattern recognition

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.390
installed after you
do this process.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.240
So it will make your snippets
available on Google, but it's

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.660
not nicely sharing that data
with the rest of the open web.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.450
And we're sensitive to that.

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.460
We recommend that you do
transition to implementing

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.960
full markup on your
site when you can.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.480
But having said that, it is a
great and easy way to get

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.500
started exploring what markup
will do for your site.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.980
When you are ready to transition
to markup, we are

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:05.020
announcing as of today a new
tool, Structured Data Markup

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.260
Helper, which is also available
for all those same

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.030
data types you just saw
in Data Highlighter.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:14.630
You again, apply the same
point and click tagging

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.860
operation to a sample web
page on your site.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.430
And this time, instead of trying
to fancily learn the

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.680
pattern of your whole site
what we're going to do is

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.090
recommend microdata and
schema.org markup that you can

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.750
then copy into your
HTML source.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.840
So to demonstrate how Structured
Data Markup Helper

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.750
works, I'd like to send away
the pirate and bring on the

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.980
web master-- the pretend
webmaster of the Computer

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.590
History Museum down
in Mountain View.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.590
JOSH AIN: Hello, everybody.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.940
As you can clearly see by my
Nintendo Entertainment System

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.430
hat, I'm the webmaster of the
Computer History Museum.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.320
I'm a big aficionado of
all things computer.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.690
I'm not actually
the webmaster.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.540
I'm not sure that he has this
hat, but I hope he does.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.020
Regardless, I'm very excited
about structured markup.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.040
I have events on my site.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.270
I want to share them
with the world.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.750
But there's a lot going on in
the Computer History Museum,

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.980
and I haven't had time to
add the markup yet.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.370
And I'm really excited for
Google to help me do that.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.790
Now, I know a lot about the
history of computers and I see

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:23.450
where we're going.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.920
And I see structured markup as
the future of computing on the

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.230
web, and I want the Computer
History Museum to be part of

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.830
that, for sure.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.570
So to get started, I'm going
to take this URL of my

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:37.220
upcoming events, copy
it, and go into the

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.160
Structured Markup Helper.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.040
So here in the Structured Data
Markup Helper I'll paste in my

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.480
URL into this field.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.210
I could also paste in HTML if
was building a new site and

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.780
hadn't put it online yet.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.440
And then choose what type
of data I want to tag.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.680
So here I want to tag events.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.120
Once I'm done with that, I'll
go ahead and start tagging.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.960
JUSTIN BOYAN: We'll instrument
the page for point and click

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.790
tagging, just like we did
in Data Highlighter.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:10.530
JOSH AIN: So here we go.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.580
That's the same page that
we were just looking at.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.220
And I've got my fields for
events, the fields that

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.430
Google's interested
in for an event.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.360
So I'll go ahead and highlight
my first event.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.780
There's the name.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.030
There's the date.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.745
Here's an image to go
with the event.

00:21:28.745 --> 00:21:31.950
And I think that's enough.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.240
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, well,
you've got multiple

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.220
events on that page.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.290
I'm afraid you're going to
have to keep on tagging.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:36.805
JOSH AIN: OK.

00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:38.055
We'll do my second one.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.800
And oh, what just happened
there, Justin?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.980
JUSTIN BOYAN: A little
bit of magic.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.480
When we recognize there's a
repeated structure of HTML on

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.200
your page, we'll go ahead and
automatically suggest the rest

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.540
of the tags on that page, so you
don't need to do them all

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.910
one by one.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:55.670
JOSH AIN: So that looks right.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.280
Looking at the tags, it looks
like the whole page is filled

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.710
in with all of my events.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.060
And even notice that the first
two events have images but

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.910
subsequent events did not.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.980
And it was OK with that.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.630
Looking at the right I can
review my data, and all of my

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.160
events are there.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.290
So I guess I'm done.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.010
JUSTIN BOYAN: Go ahead
in create HTML.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.150
And here's where we'll show you
sample markup that you can

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.360
go ahead and apply
to your site.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.870
So you'll see highlighted in
yellow on the right-hand side

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.410
all our recommended additions.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:32.010
So scrolling down there you see
we have suggested an item

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:36.440
type of schema.org/event and
several item props for the

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.390
date and name and image
on those events.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.860
JOSH AIN: So it looks great.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.970
JUSTIN BOYAN: You can also see
we've shown you how to

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.000
normalize the date into the
recommended schema.org ISO

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.430
8601 format.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.930
JOSH AIN: That's great.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.530
And I can just take these new
sections and add them to my

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.600
templating system, and then
I'll have markup.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.310
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right on.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.620
JOSH AIN: Now, is this
everything that I need, then?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.840
I'm done?

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.120
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, let me tell
you about an unfortunate

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.950
experience that my friend at
the San Francisco Museum of

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:07.850
Modern Art had.

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:08.580
JOSH AIN: Ohm I know him well.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.340
He's a good guy.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.920
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, well,
he didn't connect up the

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.970
locations to his events
properly.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.850
I think you better go back
and add location.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.500
JOSH AIN: Let's see if
we can fix that.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.580
So I've got the location up
here, the Computer History

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:19.950
Museum,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.320
JUSTIN BOYAN: Oh, god,
that's an image.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.540
How's going to work?

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.290
JOSH AIN: So I'll tag that
as the location name.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.580
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes, in this
case, the alt text on the

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.910
image, as frequently is the
case, corresponds to the

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.900
semantic content of what
that image represents.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.010
So we've just pulled
the alt text in.

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:42.840
We also noticed that it was
structurally outside the scope

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.220
of the events on the page, and
so we've distributed that

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:48.280
location down and put it
in each of the events.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:48.940
JOSH AIN: Oh, good, yeah.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.670
It's in each of my events
rather than

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.550
just the first event.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.370
Perfect.

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:53.140
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:55.460
JOSH AIN: Let's see the
HTML that creates.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:55.790
JUSTIN BOYAN: Right.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.940
So here it's become a little bit
more complicated because

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.720
of the non-hierarchical nature,
the non self-contained

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.060
nature of the events.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.580
So the recommended markup
uses a feature of

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.890
microdata called itemref.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.230
So it shows you how
to do that.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.050
Little more complicated, but
still gives you something to

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:21.070
work from as you implement
markup on your site.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.420
JOSH AIN: Looks great to me.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.450
Thanks, Justin.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.640
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.310
That is the Structured
Data Markup Helper.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.190
It is available to any logged
in Google user.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.680
You do not need to
be a webmaster

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.920
to use Markup Helper.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:36.650
It, like I said before, is
available for the same eight

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.200
data types the Data
Highlighter is.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.960
So there they are
on the screen.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.690
In addition, we are supporting
the smart email schemas that

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.590
were announced yesterday
and will be discussed

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.320
further this afternoon.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.680
So if you want to annotate an
HTML email with information

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.810
about a flight reservation or
a hotel reservation, things

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.930
like that, this tool will
help you add markup to

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.790
that email as well.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:05.780
And that will output in JSON-LD

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.740
format, as well as microdata.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.660
JOSH AIN: So that's
very exciting.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:11.220
I believe there are sessions at
2:15, or somewhere around

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.900
then this afternoon.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.180
You should definitely check
it out, as well.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.880
JUSTIN BOYAN: So that basically

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.210
concludes our four demos.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.550
Again, in summary, we've got
two tools that help you

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.770
validate markup that you've
already applied to your site.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.680
We've got Data Highlighter that
lets you test the waters

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.320
of structured markup by very
quickly, without even having

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.360
the access or the time to modify
your website, show

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.960
Google how to understand it.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.640
And when you are ready to start
adding markup at first,

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.270
there's the new Markup Helper.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.290
And that's all we've got.

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.760
We would be very happy
to take questions.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.135
JOSH AIN: And we also
have some shirts for

00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:53.020
you on the way out.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.850
Would you like to show them
the shirts, Justin?

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.410
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yes, without--

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.880
JOSH AIN: It's this
flannel shirt.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.606
No, just kidding.

00:26:00.606 --> 00:26:03.938
Nice flannel shirts.

00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:07.800
JUSTIN BOYAN: Don't you worry
about a schema.org/Thing.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.570
JOSH AIN: So those are on the
way out, if you're interested.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:10.820
Thank you.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.420
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.950
Let's say I work for a large
retailer that has hundreds of

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.420
thousands of products
on the web.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.210
Can you help me give a business
case to my bosses to

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.040
tell them, we really need
to open this up.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.190
Obviously, it's creating a new
available marketplace of

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.380
getting just the information
out there for all people to

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.600
consume that data is one
of the big reasons.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.590
Are there other ways that you
would recommend doing that?

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:47.480
JOSH AIN: So just repeat the
question, I think what I heard

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.960
was, working for a big retailer

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.780
with lots of products.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.650
How do you make the business
case for the value of adding

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.390
this markup and what
it gets you.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.180
Is that right?

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.610
JUSTIN BOYAN: The basic sell
is enhanced presentation in

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.860
search results.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.080
So if you're a retailer and
when your organic search

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.475
results don't show that
product and price rich

00:27:10.475 --> 00:27:12.940
snippet, then you're missing
out on the chance to really

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.470
show people my product's
in stock.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.910
This is the cost
of my product.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.770
It's really for sale and it's
got a four star review.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:28.990
So the intent is to make the
more relevant data available

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.640
to users so the people who come
to your site are knowing

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.760
what they're getting.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.220
AUDIENCE: So it's
one less click.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.150
So they don't have to click
through to see that same

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:37.790
information.

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.970
JOSH AIN: They don't have to
click through, but also,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.280
you're giving them a reason to
click through by telling them

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.200
it's in stock and providing
the other important

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.410
information, the information
that we find people are most

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.750
likely to look for to entice
them to click on your links

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:52.690
and come to your site.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.400
Just a quick question about how
you handling JavaScript.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.970
JOSH AIN: OK.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:58.920
Yeah, we do our best.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.570
So are you talking about in
Data Highlighter or??

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because a lot of
data and especially images

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.310
are provided dynamically
through JavaScript.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:12.470
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, we do our
best to actually execute the

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:17.630
JavaScript and provide you
access to the rendered version

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.300
of the page, post JavaScript.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.300
JOSH AIN: At a technical level,
we're not showing you

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.360
the raw HTML.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.500
We are rendering the page
in a browser and then

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.440
showing that to you.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.660
So it doesn't work 100% of the
time, but most of the time if

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:32.630
you have JavaScript that's
executing on load to show

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.660
images, et cetera, those will
show up in the version that we

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:39.500
display in Data Highlighter
and Markup Helper.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.810
AUDIENCE: And if we have
navigation through images, is

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.240
that something you would--

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.340
I mean, you don't actually
follow navigation, do you?

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.960
JUSTIN BOYAN: We don't follow
navigation, that's right.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.240
JOSH AIN: Right.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.750
So we do allow you to tag a
link, if that's an important

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.880
piece of information.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.750
But we're not navigating
the site.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.840
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.510
And my question is, with
relation to the last example,

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:07.620
so you applied the structured
markup to a list of events.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.340
I wanted to know one, what is
the best practice there versus

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.290
putting the markup
on your list page

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.280
versus the detail page?

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.440
And in the search results,
is it going to

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.990
link the list page?

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.120
JUSTIN BOYAN: Great question.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.250
Both.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.580
We recommend you do
both, if you can.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.810
So the listing pages often are
higher ranked in search and

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.480
are going to get more views.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.990
And so it's great if
the structured data

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.520
is available there.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.530
For events in particular,
there is a rich snippet

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.030
treatment that will show
multiple events associated

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.620
with a single page up to, I
forget, three or four of them,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.640
but will provide
separate links.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.010
From the list page, it'll
actually provide multiple

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.220
links right off that snippet
into the details pages.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.310
AUDIENCE: So if you're showing
something like let's say,

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:05.770
restaurants, I can show basic
restaurant data on the list

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.610
page in the structured markup.

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:12.060
Should I also show reviews in
that markup, or should I limit

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.880
that to let's say, the
detail page markup?

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.520
JUSTIN BOYAN: I honestly don't
know the answer to that.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.610
I know for a details page that
markup will be featured.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:26.120
And I'm not sure whether
multiple reviews on a listing

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.970
page would get a special
treatment in the rich snippet

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.250
for that listing page.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.930
I'm not sure.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.580
JOSH AIN: But there's the
picture of what happens right

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.960
now with Google and there's the
picture of what's going to

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.590
happen in six months.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.630
I think that the more structured
data that we all

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.210
add to the web, the more we can
do with structured data.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.360
And so we have motivations that
are current, and then the

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.700
more data that accumulates we
can add more motivations and

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.950
more uses of it.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.990
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.590
I'm working a large e-commerce
platform.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:05.740
So I'd like to know, with this
structured data, if you add

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.520
some specific data like stock
and it's very dynamic, how

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:18.420
often is it queried or things
to show accurate data?

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.300
Is there any special treatment
for very dynamic data?

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.320
JUSTIN BOYAN: For very
dynamic data.

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.380
I think the Google crawl
is very dynamic.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.300
So we are just responding to the
data as we see it in the

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.890
Google crawl, but the crawl
itself is very dynamic and

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:44.370
does a lot of self-adjusting
depending on the kind of site

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:48.660
and how often we detect that its
core content is updating.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:53.180
So in that sense, it depends
on your site and the

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.470
properties of the crawl, but we
can't really influence that

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.290
much based on structured data.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.000
AUDIENCE: On the website, is
there a plan to add this

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.790
structured data to products
like AdWords?

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:12.320
For the textiles, sometimes
it's very difficult to

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.180
generate a specific textile
for each group.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.000
So it could be a good idea.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.640
JUSTIN BOYAN: That is
a great idea for a

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.650
future Google product.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.770
JOSH AIN: So you're saying to
generate ads based on the

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:25.550
structured data on your--

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:31.740
AUDIENCE: Yes, like a schema
textile, like a template and

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:37.040
filter is like an improvement
for a keyboard insertion.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.030
JUSTIN BOYAN: I think it's a
wonderful idea to have that

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:43.580
sort of collaboration, but
there's no announcement of

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.940
anything like that planned,
as far as I know.

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.530
AUDIENCE: Are there plans to
add more data types or

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.020
potentially let users define
their own objects with the

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:58.250
data points, and then highlight
them and map them?

00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:59.210
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah,
there aren't--

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:04.110
we haven't thought about letting
users extend that set

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:09.860
of types that are available to
tag, but there certainly are

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.650
plans for us to expand
that list.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:15.790
We're basically growing this
product from scratch and

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.820
trying to get a sense of how
accurate the data is that

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.690
comes in through it.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.030
And we're also careful not to
get too far ahead of ourselves

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.980
in exposing schemas
that Google isn't

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.970
making much use of yet.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.560
So we don't want to make people
do a bunch of work--

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.330
AUDIENCE: How long has the Data

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:34.430
Highlighter been available?

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.750
This is the first I actually
had heard of it.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.000
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, it launched
in December, quietly

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.670
with a blog post on the
Webmaster Central blog.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:47.500
And as of yesterday, it's
expanded just beyond events to

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.820
these eight data types.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.830
It's also available
in 40 languages.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.300
AUDIENCE: One last question.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.420
What are some of the biggest
challenges that you still have

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.370
to solve for that potentially
Google or other

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.420
people could help with?

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.770
JUSTIN BOYAN: Biggest
challenges?

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.400
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
it's not perfect, some pages

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:05.890
won't work.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.530
Are there any specific things
that the community could help

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.510
with in any fashion?

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.380
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, the Data
Highlighter tool, which is

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.239
machine learning based, there's
always going to be a

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.699
limit to what a pattern
recognition tool can do,

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.350
especially if your site is
excitingly variable.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.750
So markup is always the safer
choice, where you can be very

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.659
specific and explicit about what
the data is on each and

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:34.469
every page regardless of
how it's formatted.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.429
Nevertheless, we're always
working to improve the pattern

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:40.449
recognition so it does work
more smoothly on a higher

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.390
percentage of sites.

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:47.350
With Markup Helper there's a
challenge, because actually,

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.770
there are many ways to generate
the structured markup

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.929
for a given page.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.570
And so we're continuing
to refine that.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.750
This is an initial launch, but
we're looking at Ways to

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.170
simplify its output, always
generate the easiest, most

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.570
intuitive form of the markup.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.600
So that's another focus.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.330
JOSH AIN: The other piece that
I'd just add to your earlier

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:10.430
point, Data Highlighter was
launched in December.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.320
Markup Helper launched today.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.460
Structured Data Dashboard
launched last summer.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.820
There's a lot of work
going on here.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.400
We're trying to improve the
experience and we understand

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.350
that there's a lot of options.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.290
We want to make it
easier for you.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.250
So if you have pain points using
structured data that are

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.220
not being addressed,
come talk to us.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.420
We'd love to learn about them.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.390
JUSTIN BOYAN: Yeah, and we will
be, after lunch, at the

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.860
third floor Knowledge Sandbox.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.040
And also, there is the Webmaster
Tools forum which is

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.570
open, and that's where we
monitor people's feedback on

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.710
these tools.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.190
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
it's me again.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.420
Is the structured data that you
put into the site, is that

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.840
going to be pulled into stuff
like Maps and some of the

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.980
other things that we're shown
with regards to Google+ and

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.230
stuff like that?

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.790
JUSTIN BOYAN: We are sensitive
about pulling data from

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.400
people's web pages out of the
context of those web pages,

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.920
because we realize we're
in an ecosystem.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:13.620
But having said that, we are
always looking for the best

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.430
possible user experience.

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:19.860
So we want to do the best job
of both answering user's

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:25.970
questions and directing them to
the authoritative owners of

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:27.380
web content.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.640
So yes.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.120
JOSH AIN: I think G+
will definitely use

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.560
structured data in some--

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.330
sometimes the same vocabulary,
sometimes different

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:37.340
vocabularies, to preview
the content of

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.150
a page that's shared.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:41.980
And otherwise, we're using
structured data now, or

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.480
planning to use it wherever it
make sense-- we have enough

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.480
coverage and we have the right
motivation with the webmaster.

00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:56.220
AUDIENCE: I help manage a large
commerce site, so we

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:00.680
have a dot com and then a mobile
property, as well.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.320
Mobile property is powered
by an API.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.480
All the content data is the
same, but it's just a

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.260
different back end.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.410
So we use structured data
on the big site.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.640
On the mobile site, though, we
don't use structured data.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.560
Is that a problem?

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.820
Should we be using structured
data for the mobile

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.070
property, as well?

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:23.250
JUSTIN BOYAN: Good question.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.640
So you mean like a
mobile website?

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.220
You're not talking
about an app?

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.850
AUDIENCE: No, it's actually
m dot ticketmaster.com

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.100
JUSTIN BOYAN: M dot.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:37.270
I don't know.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.320
I'm going to answer that one
with an I don't know.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.655
JOSH AIN: I think it depends
on your search strategy.

00:37:41.655 --> 00:37:45.720
If you're referring to your
desktop version of your site

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.100
as canonical in all instances,
then you don't expect your

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.790
mobile site to show
up in search.

00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:53.660
So for the motivations that we
were showing today, it doesn't

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.000
matter if it's on your
mobile site.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.840
If you do expect the mobile
site to be a first order

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.490
destination, then it is useful
to have the same structured

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.986
markup that you're already
using on your main site.

00:38:03.986 --> 00:38:06.470
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.750
AUDIENCE: Similar question.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.270
If we already have structured
data in the form of JSON or

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.970
any sort of external API, is
there a simple way to just

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.590
link from our product page that
you're crawling to where

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:22.260
that structured data
already is?

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.300
JUSTIN BOYAN: No.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.860
I don't think so.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.826
You mean, if you have--

00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:31.170
so your data is not in the web
page, but it's available on

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.580
the web in some other format?

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, most
web pages get created from

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:36.950
some sort of structured
data already.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:39.265
So if we already have that--
in fact, we're creating our

00:38:39.265 --> 00:38:43.520
web pages from a back end API
already, so why not just give

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.047
you a link to that instead
of peppering our

00:38:47.047 --> 00:38:48.480
HTML page with it?

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.390
JUSTIN BOYAN: There is,
philosophically, to us a

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.350
benefit to having the markup
right in the user-visible web

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.140
page, because that's, to us,
the ultimate guarantee that

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.040
the structured data we're
showing corresponds to the

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.740
user-visible version
of that data.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.950
And if you point us to the API
directly and explain the

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.740
mapping somehow that way, maybe
that's right for your

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.650
site, but in some other site the
two data sources might get

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.370
out of sync.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.760
AUDIENCE: Well, the question
was actually--

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:21.360
I thought of it based on his
mobile question just

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:21.860
previously.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.640
There are numerous ways to
consume the same data that

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.880
we're providing to our users.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.760
And so creating that structured
data in every

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.370
format of consumption, whether
it's mobile or other third

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:38.060
party applications or web, it
all points back to that same

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.280
structured data in
the first place.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.710
So putting out multiple copies
of all of the structured data

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.770
seems confusing, potentially,
for Google and others.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:50.660
JUSTIN BOYAN: Well, it's just
some lightweight HTML

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.780
annotations on the
presentation.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.746
And so if you're presenting in
multiple ways, I don't think

00:39:55.746 --> 00:39:59.970
you should necessarily think of
it as a huge burden to put

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.620
those annotations on each
different presentation.

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.940
JOSH AIN: But I also think that
you're going to have a

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.330
canonical version, or you can
specify a canonical version.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.780
And so the canonical version, I
believe, is what we're going

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.920
to refer to in search,
not the other

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.900
representations of the same page.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.700
So if the structured data is
there in the canonical

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.120
version, then we'll
understand it.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.980
I'd also add that, as we saw in
this little crying slide,

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:24.790
we do understand lots of
different formats.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.640
But as Justin said, we prefer
to be on the page so that we

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:31.650
can actually associate it with
the user-visible data.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, to seem like
a single canonical

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:34.990
version for the web.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.060
But then it seems like it would
be even better to have a

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:41.640
single canonical version for all
presentations of that same

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.130
information.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:45.550
JUSTIN BOYAN: Let's talk
about this more.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:46.900
JOSH AIN: Yeah, we'd love
to keep talking.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.160
Looks like we're out of time.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.490
But thank you all.
