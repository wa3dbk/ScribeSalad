IAN ELLISON TAYLOR:
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.630
Thank you for coming.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.680
I want to thank everyone who
made it down to Mountain View.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.670
It looks like we got a pretty
packed house tonight.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.190
That's pretty good.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.840
Hopefully, it wasn't
just for the beer.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.770
And of course, we have
an audience on video

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.770
conference from Asia.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.890
I'm assuming they can see us,
since I can't see them.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590
But anyway, thank
you for coming.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.910
Hopefully, you'll have a fun and
interesting evening about

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.460
Native Client.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
So to rewind just a little bit,
I think Google's fairly

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.250
well known for being a little
bit obsessed about

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.630
performance.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.640
And so two, three years ago,
someone posed the question of

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.630
what would it be like if we
could run native code inside

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.820
the browser?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.883
And that seemed like a really
interesting question, and it

00:00:46.883 --> 00:00:52.890
sort of broke down into two main
goals for that, that we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.920
started really investing in.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.380
The first, of course, was how
to bring native applications

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.730
to the web in terms of
performance and the power.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.640
But also maintaining what's good
about the web in terms of

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.150
security and portability, so
that was goal number one.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
Goal number two was really
about enriching the web

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.680
ecosystem by bringing a lot
of other programming

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350
languages to the web.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.430
Particularly programming
languages that had been around

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.440
and were in popular use,
and had been in popular

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.020
use for a long time.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.110
So that started a long road,
and I think it was pretty

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.920
entertaining, and we've come
a long way I think in those

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.360
three years.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.860
So to talk a little bit more
about the technology and the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.950
goals, I'm going to start with
the technical lead for Native

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.732
Client, Brad Chen, come on up.

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:47.088
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:49.060
BRAD CHEN: Thank you, Ian.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.450
And thanks to all of
you for coming to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.880
Mountain View this evening.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.550
On the engineering side of this
project, we had two main

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.520
problems we needed to solve.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.530
Of course, we had to make Native
Client safe, to protect

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.110
users from the kinds of
problems that have

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.550
historically been common
with native

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.880
applications and native plug-ins.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.270
We were painfully aware of the
history of security issues

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.010
that have arisen with
technology, such as NPAPI and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.840
ActiveX, and we were determined
to learn the right

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.450
lessons from those systems.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.880
But security alone is not
enough, obviously.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.470
We needed to make a system
that was powerful.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.480
We needed to make a system that
would enable developers

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.830
to deliver applications that
were new and exciting, but

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.520
that weren't already happening
on the web.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.630
Now, in the three or so years
that have transpired since we

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.970
first started the research
project, we've made

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.310
significant progress towards
solving these problems. With

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.040
our Chrome 14 release, we've
shipped a browser that allows

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.090
application developers to ship
real applications using the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.740
Native Client sandbox.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.120
Together with a core set of
Pepper interfaces that support

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.940
facilities such as 2D graphics,
real-time audio

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.540
playback, URL loading, and
asynchronous messaging with

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.240
JavaScript.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.410
And we've really enjoyed seeing
our early adopter

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.500
developers deliver vintage
arcade games to Native Client

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.140
on the web, by porting
emulators

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.880
like MAME and DOSBox.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.080
In our more recent release,
we've actually added some more

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.070
ambitious and yet very
important features.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.350
One really key feature is

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.610
hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.620
This enables developers to
do real-time rendering of

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.750
detailed scenes, providing the
kinds of rich interactive

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.820
experience that we're all trying
to deliver these days.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.000
We also provide sandbox
local file storage.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.780
This is a critical feature for
developers who want to provide

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.430
a really great user experience,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.940
both online and offline.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.390
It enables application
developers to provide

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.130
applications that
start quickly.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.370
Because graphics, audio, and
other kinds of application

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.410
data are stored once on the
local disk, and so they're

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.770
already available the next time
the application starts.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.090
We also provide, in our most
recent releases, dynamic

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.450
loading and the popular GNU libc
implementation, making it

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.390
that much easier
to port complex

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.210
applications to Native Client.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.380
I'd also like to mention
full-screen

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.970
mode and mouse capture.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.640
These are critical features
for application developers

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.260
that are trying to provide a
truly immersive experience.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.280
The result of all of this is
that today, through Native

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.950
Client, application developers
can use native code safely in

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.890
Chrome across all popular
desktop operating systems. And

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.490
they have access to a rich and
growing set of resources from

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.340
the browser.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.360
So with that, I'd like to
introduce Erik Kay.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.110
Erik is an engineering manager
for Native Client, and he's

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.800
going to tell us a little bit
more about what this means for

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.090
developers and for the web.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.825
Erik.

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:29.775
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:32.220
ERIK KAY: Thanks, Brad,
and hi everyone.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.060
So you've heard that developers
are now going to be

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.470
able to bring their native code
to the web, but what does

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.370
that really mean for
the web at large?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.550
Well the first thing is, is that
it means that decades of

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.940
native code that's been built,
and the expertise that comes

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.010
with it, and those millions of
developers who are experienced

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.850
in developing native code, can
now bring that to the web.

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:56.330
It'll now be an easy decision
for them to decide to port

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.890
their applications to the web,
because they no longer have to

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.950
rewrite them from scratch
in HTML and JavaScript.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.940
There's now no reason why
many desktop and mobile

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.220
applications can't also
run on your browser.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.920
We're also going to enable
higher performance computing

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.120
on the web.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.920
Now, native code, running in
NaCl will often run multiple

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.060
times faster than JavaScript
today, and that's in

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.870
single-threaded mode.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.800
But Native Client also has
access to efficient

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.840
multi-threading, which means it
can take full advantage of

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.430
your multi-core CPUs.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.600
This is going to enable a wide
variety of applications that

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.480
weren't possible on
the web before.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.830
Now, it's going to do this while
maintaining the security

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.400
model of the web today.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.950
Now the main reason for this
is the sandbox that Brad

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.220
mentioned earlier.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.870
But it's also because of our
philosophy and what kind of

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.910
APIs that we've brought
to Native Client.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.910
Unlike previous technologies,
like NPAPI and ActiveX, we're

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.630
not bringing new capabilities
to the web.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.010
Instead, what we're bringing
is the web capabilities to

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.050
Native Code.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.550
Now this means that Native Code
will run with the same

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.940
security level as JavaScript.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.720
Now we believe the applications
you're going to

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.660
see tonight are going to
demonstrate the real need for

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.490
this technology.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.590
It's bringing applications
that were never before

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.000
possible on the web.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.030
And as such, we think it's
important for this technology

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.900
to not be limited to
a single browser.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.920
We've developed Native Client
from the beginning in the

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.630
public as an open source
project, and are committed to

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.970
working with other browser
vendors to

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.320
bring it to all users.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.070
We work closely with the open
source community, accepting

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.460
external contributions, and
we're looking forward to

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.610
continuing that close
relationship.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.180
Now that's what it means for
the web, but what about for

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.420
developers?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.090
Well, one of the big problems
developers have today is that

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.450
there are so many platforms
out there.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:04.260
You're having to develop for
Windows, for Mac, maybe iOS,

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.970
and Android, maybe a game
console, then there's the web.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.400
This often involves you having
to maintain multiple

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.290
development teams, multiple
code bases--

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.540
trying to keep them all in
sync is a very expensive

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.670
proposition.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.550
With Native Client, you're now
going to be able to leverage

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.400
your existing code base,
and quickly and easily

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.940
bring it to the web.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.880
We've seen already developers
bring million line code bases

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.280
to Native Client, in just a
couple of weeks and a handful

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.600
of developers.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.720
And that's including the time
necessary to just learn the

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.370
technology to begin with.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.250
Now, for many developers, the
best part is going to be the

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.246
fact that now on the web you're
going to be able to use

00:08:45.246 --> 00:08:46.960
your favorite programming
language.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.750
You don't need to
learn new stuff.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.090
You can leverage your existing
knowledge, your existing

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.670
tools, your existing technology
that you've spent

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.390
so much time and effort
investing in.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.870
And further, it's important to
remember that development is

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.750
not just about writing code,
it's also about the

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.090
tools behind it.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.930
You have build systems, testing,
revision control--

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.200
all of these systems will work
seamlessly with your existing

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.860
code base and Native Client.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.730
So once you've built your
application, you need to

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.780
distribute it.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.210
We're here to help
with that too.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.750
Today, you can build your app,
publish it in the Chrome web

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.080
store, and have direct access to
the rapidly growing Chrome

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.790
user base, now well over
200 million users.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:39.020
This is a pretty exciting
group--

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.900
a pretty large user
base already--

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.440
but pretty soon you'll be able
to grow to an even larger

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.820
audience, and deliver them
directly via the web.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.170
Now obviously, all these new
apps that you're going to see

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.930
today are going to have
huge impact on users.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.820
To talk about that in more
detail is Christian, our

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.440
product manager.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.210
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Thanks,
Erik, and hi everybody.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.040
So as Erik mentioned, Native
Client really enables

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.100
applications that just wouldn't
be possible before.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.770
Either because they were too
performance demanding, or

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.040
simply because of the time
it would require to

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.090
rewrite these apps.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.800
And so there's several
categories of applications

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.705
that we feel are really a
natural fit for Native Client.

00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:33.970
The first category
is the games.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.750
In particular, 3D accelerated
games, computationally

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.140
intensive games, and in fact,
many of the early adopters

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.480
that you're going to see here
today at the demo stations in

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.410
the back are games,
and there's a

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:46.570
good reason for that.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.670
Games are a category that
traditionally push the

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.430
boundaries of what's possible
on a platform--

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.620
in this case, the
web platform.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.550
Other categories are photo
editing, video

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.390
editing, image editing.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.150
Imagine anything that involves
image transformations,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.310
computationally intensive
filters,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.730
anything along those lines.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.310
Another category
is 3D modeling,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.930
interactive training software--

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.740
and in fact, we have
a company that does

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.090
exactly that here today.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.240
Another category would be
computer aided design.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.820
Again, you have this conjunction
really of 3D

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:28.540
modeling and heavy
computation.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.100
The same applies for
another category,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.030
namely scientific computing.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:38.780
So math, statistics, protein
folding, signal processing,

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.490
anything along the lines--

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.380
anything that you would classify
as heavy number

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.550
crunching would be a great
fit for Native Client.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.670
So, of course, most of the users
are not going to care

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.460
about using Native Client, or
even know that they're using

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.780
Native Client.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.730
What they're going to care about
is the fact they get

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.440
applications that are as feature
rich and as responsive

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.890
as desktop applications.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.930
Yet they're synchronized across
all their machines

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.520
seamlessly, so they don't have
to install them several times.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.790
They're also going to care
about the security.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.370
Because Native Client is
as safe as other web

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.450
applications, you can run them,
install them, knowing

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.210
that your system is
going to be safe.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.530
And incidentally, the install is
a frictionless process, and

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.110
you are not going to need admin

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.625
privileges on your machine.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.400
So we've been working closely
with several early adopters of

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.370
Native Client.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.750
And next I'd like to invite a
couple of them up here on

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:39.540
stage and talk about
their experience

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.310
using Native Client.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.880
First, I am honored
and privileged to

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.560
introduce Yoichi Wada.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.670
He is the CEO and President
of Square Enix, one of the

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.800
largest global game companies.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.268
So please help me welcome
Yoichi Wada.

00:12:55.268 --> 00:13:04.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.660
YOICHI WADA: Thank you very
much for inviting me to an

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.710
occasion as momentous as
today's announcement.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.970
I can say it's a great honor
to be here with all of you.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:22.060
I'm convinced that Google's
Native Client will be welcomed

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.740
worldwide as a truly innovative
technology.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.720
Not only for the IT industry,
but for the

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.230
games industry as well.

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.640
Video games are capable of
expressing rich experiences,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.230
and are deeply loved by players
around the globe.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.530
However, they are also
incredibly complex

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.210
applications, and until
recently playing games

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:55.055
required specialized consoles
intended for that purpose.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:02.630
We in the game industry have
strived to present games on

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.970
general purpose devices to bring
joy to greater numbers

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.060
of customers.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:10.920
Through the [? pleasure ?]

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.790
games and the social games
played in the browser, many

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.890
people who had previously not
played games have entered the

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.140
gaming world.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.070
But browser technology
limited us to

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.320
offering very simple products.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:39.620
Google's Native Client
solves this problem.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.300
We are releasing a port of Mini
Ninjas as our first step

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.020
with Native Client.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.280
We have prepared a demo
of the game today.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.320
Please give it a try, and ask
our developers about their

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.620
experience porting the game.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.310
The feeling is something
that is

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.510
difficult to put into words.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.320
You can't tell the difference
between playing on Native

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.170
Client and playing on
a game console.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.840
Through this porting work, we
became convinced that Native

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.910
Client is an excellent solution
for browser gaming.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.560
I should point out that I don't
believe that games with

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.700
console-level quality are
superior, or that such games

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.575
should be played by
all consumers.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:45.810
My point is that, given that
consumers have varied tastes,

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:50.240
we should present a wide
variety of games.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.440
All the first-class businesses
offer a wide selection of

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.005
choices to consumers.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.000
With Native Client, the games
industry has been able to

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.690
realize this for
the first time.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:13.190
Furthermore, what is important
about Native Client to gaming?

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.440
It's not just that you can
present a game to the same

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.560
level of quality as
a game console.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.270
What is critical is the
fact that Chrome is,

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.070
above all, a browser.

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.210
The combination of browser and
console quality gaming will be

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:41.110
the impetus for social features
within these games,

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.160
to evolve far more rapidly
than has ever

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.190
been possible before.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.500
It is incredibly exciting to be
able to work with Google in

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.830
expanding rich game experiences
around the world.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:02.990
Let us begin this new
era together.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.004
Thank you.

00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:13.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.349
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: I'm just
going to repeat one thing,

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.720
which is, go have a
look at the game.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.200
It's on the demo stations
after this, and it's a

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:20.900
gorgeous game.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.329
So, really, check it out.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.490
Our next presenter
is Amir Rao.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.310
He is the Studio Director
of Supergiant Games.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:33.110
And he's going to talk a
little bit about their

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.220
experiences porting their
award-winning game, Bastion,

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:36.470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.740
Native Client.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.990
Everybody, Amir Rao.

00:17:45.384 --> 00:17:47.690
AMIR RAO: I'm Amir, this
is Greg, we're

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.730
from Supergiant Games.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:52.500
Supergiant Games is a small,
independent developer with

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.045
seven people.

00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:55.300
It's located in San Francisco,
California.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.090
We actually started in the
living room of a house in

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.150
2009, and over the course of
20 months we built Bastion,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.220
which we released on Xbox Live
Arcade and PC this summer in

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.940
conjunction with Warner
Brothers.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.670
And since then, people
have been asking us

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.390
what we're up to.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.520
And actually, one of the things
we've been up to is

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.160
Bastion for Chrome.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.390
So We're just going to show the
game running in a browser

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.255
so you can see it
for yourself.

00:18:24.255 --> 00:18:24.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.490
-Proper story's supposed to
start at the beginning.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.320
Ain't so simple with this one.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.270
Now here's a kid whose whole
world got a little twisted,

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.820
leaving him stranded on
a rock in the sky.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.670
He gets up, sets off for the
Bastion, where everyone agreed

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.130
to go in case of trouble.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.460
Ground forms up under his feet
as if pointing the way.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.970
He don't stop to wonder why.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.990
He finds his lifelong friend
just lying in the road.

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.580
Well, it's a touching reunion.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.550
He sees what's left of
the rippling walls.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.780
Years of work undone in an
instant in the calamity.

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:17.988
Is that a survivor?

00:19:17.988 --> 00:19:21.980
No ma'am, it's a Gasfella forced
out from underground.

00:19:24.974 --> 00:19:29.465
The kid pops him good-- fella
got a piece of him though.

00:19:29.465 --> 00:19:32.459
And then, he falls
to his death.

00:19:32.459 --> 00:19:33.885
I'm just fooling.

00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:34.310
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.560
AMIR RAO: So yeah.

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.420
So for those you who've played
Bastion on other platforms,

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.460
that may look familiar.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.980
And that's kind of what's so
exciting to us about it, is

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.100
it's the same sort of rich
narrative experience that you

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.210
get on your console, or on the
PC version of the game right

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.760
inside your browser.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.660
The other exciting thing for us
was bringing the game to a

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.750
whole new audience.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.900
And to welcome that audience,
we added a new mode to

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.420
Bastion, which we call 'no
sweat mode.' It basically

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.275
allows you to experience the
audio and art and story of

00:20:02.275 --> 00:20:04.510
Bastion with reduced
combat difficulty.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.810
And also, we kind of were
relishing the technical

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.150
challenge of putting the
game on a new platform.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.200
And with Google support
we got into a browser

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.390
in about two months.

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:16.400
So yeah, it's a really
exciting time for us.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.970
Today, right after I sit down,
we're going to put our version

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.870
of Bastion right on the Chrome
web store, so you'll be able

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.170
to play it.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.170
And then tomorrow we're headed
off to LA for the Machinima

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.590
Inside Gaming Awards
and the Spike VGAs.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:32.420
We're nominated for 10
categories across both shows.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:35.670
And then tomorrow we're
announcing our new DLC for

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.863
Bastion, which actually will
appear on Native Client and

00:20:37.863 --> 00:20:38.530
all other platforms.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.940
So it's big week for us.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.750
Thanks a lot to Google
for having us here.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.350
And, yeah, you can come
play the game

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.710
and talk to our engineers.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.075
Five of our team members
are here.

00:20:53.302 --> 00:20:55.870
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN:
Thanks, Amir.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.910
I've already spent quite a lot
of time playing Bastion for

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.350
testing purposes, obviously,
and so can you, apparently,

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.330
starting now.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.480
So our next presenter is
something quite different.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.640
I alluded to this before when
I said that you can do 3D

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.670
training in Native Client.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.850
Our next presenter
is Neil Wadhawan.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.350
He is the VP of Sales
and Marketing

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.806
from Heartwood Studios.

00:21:22.806 --> 00:21:23.915
Welcome, Neil.

00:21:23.915 --> 00:21:27.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.340
NEIL WADHAWAN: This my
colleague, Ryan Musta.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.980
He's going to be helping
me with the demo today.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.170
Heartwood is honored
to be here.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:38.440
What we do is we support, help
our customers, enable them to

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.640
build, operate, repair, and do
maintenance, all in a 3D

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.270
interactive setting.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.970
And we're using the Unity game
engine to develop our

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:48.930
applications.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.800
We recently ported the
application to Native Client,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.670
which the developers felt that
it was somewhat seamless.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.590
It's still at its early stage,
but it definitely went well.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.650
And we're going to demo an
application to you today.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:08.270
Our customer, Sopogy, who is
a leading provider of solar

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.710
panels to the world, approached
us with a problem.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.560
And their problem was, Neil, how
do we train and market our

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.560
product anywhere in the world
without having to send a field

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.480
service rep out every time
and spend that money?

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.430
So what we did at Heartwood is
we developed a 3D interactive

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.310
learning application
that solved

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.760
that problem for Sopogy.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.580
Ryan, let's demo that.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.250
So Ryan's going to load up a
lesson for you, and we're all

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.300
going to be able to assemble
this product after we're

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.840
done-- that's the goal, right?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.290
And this is all, obviously,
running in the Chrome browser.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.690
The rich fidelity is there.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.990
We have parts here--

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:57.260
Ryan's going to start with the
anchor bolts, and move to the

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.810
stands, and so forth.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.070
It's quite an in-depth lesson,
so we're not going to go

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.530
through the entire
procedure today.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.040
But if you guys are really
curious and would like to

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.760
learn, please meet us at our
booth, and we'll teach you how

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.580
to put together this solar
panel in a 3D interactive

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.330
application.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.070
One of the things we love about
Native Client, and being

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.090
able to port to it, is our
customers don't need to

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.900
download the Unity plug-in.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.770
It's all native in the browser,
works seamlessly.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.410
We're not going to get those
calls saying hey, this didn't

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.890
work, or that didn't work.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.550
It's really nice and seamless.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.100
It's secure.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.990
And Ryan's going to preview the
product a little bit, show

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.370
you what it looks like after
it's been built--

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.870
that's the goal, what
it looks like.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:48.440
So imagine a world where we
could all train in a 3D

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.430
interactive learning
application

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.900
that's in the browser.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.560
For defense, military, heavy
machinery, medical.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.090
There's countless industries
that we can serve.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:02.090
So we're really excited
here at Heartwood.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.630
We're honored to be at
Google and working

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.290
with you in this port.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.470
We thank you for your time,
and appreciate it.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:08.319
Thank you.

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:15.025
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:15.025 --> 00:24:17.810
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Yeah, we
are very excited about seeing

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.160
something like Heartwood Studios
come on Native Client,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.570
because it shows the breadth
of Native Client.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:28.730
As I alluded to earlier, games
are interesting, because they

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.530
really push the performance, and
then a whole lot of other

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:33.300
categories will come afterwards,
and this is a

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.740
great example of
that happening.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.720
So our last presenter
is Oren Tversky.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.960
He is the VP of Business
Development at Unity

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.060
Technologies.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.260
And Unity, as you probably know,
is one of the biggest

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.140
game engines and editors, and
they have hundreds of

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.930
thousands of developers.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.620
Please help me welcome
Oren Tversky.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:00.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.180
OREN TVERSKY: So thank
you very much.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.990
We're really happy
to be there.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.190
And thanks to Neil
for the plug.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.990
But Unity is not just used to
make solar panels, and I

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.910
apologize, I can't teach anybody
how to put together

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.550
any kind of panel.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.740
As Christian mentioned, Unity
makes a tool chain and engine

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.580
that's used by 190,000
developers on a monthly basis.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.420
We estimate that about 2,000
mobile games have been made

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.930
using Unity--

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.390
lots of games also
on console on PC.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:38.770
And we also have our own web
plug-in, and this web plug-in

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.860
has an installed base of
about 90 million, and

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.450
this is pretty good.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.890
And those of you who follow
gaming trends certainly know

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:51.650
that in-browser gaming is
an up and coming trend.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.090
We've all seen the social games
and all that, but that's

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.960
extending now far and wide.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.420
So this is really where kind of
a partnership with Google

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.750
around Native Client made
a lot of sense.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:07.150
And we actually think this is
going to benefit developers

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.000
and consumers alike.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.030
If we can roll the first video,
that would be great.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.530
So this is actually the
Unity tool chain.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.900
So this is what it actually
looks like when

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.730
you're making a game.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:21.420
And as you can see, there is a
little check box that says

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.570
enable Native Client, and
then you push Go.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.080
So our goal in working with
Google, and our goal to make

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.360
our lives easier for developers,
is really kind of

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.040
that simple.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.980
Let's make it that easy.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.990
The other way we think it'll
benefit developers is through

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:42.490
distribution and monetization.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.430
And we're always looking for
ways to help our developers

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.070
reach new audiences and monetize
their games better.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:50.780
Because after all, everybody's
got to make a living, right?

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:55.180
So our web plug-in has an
installed base of about 90

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.950
million, but we're really happy
to be able to add the

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:05.140
200 million and growing Chrome
users worldwide to that

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.700
distribution channel.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.920
And we also think having a
monetization channel through

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.180
the Chrome web store
will help our

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.150
developers earn a nice living.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:19.500
But we think the benefits will
also extend to consumers.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.250
We think that having that
frictionless gaming

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:23.960
experience--

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.100
and if you can roll video
number two, please.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.360
So this is a game by a company
called SilverTree Media based

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.380
in Palo Alto, and this
game is called Cordy.

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.540
And you can see how easy
it is to launch.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.710
No plug-in, no dialogues,
frictionless.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.320
We think this will make the
consumers much more likely to

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.640
play games and to spend
money in games.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.710
The other way we think the
consumers will benefit is from

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:49.960
the native level performance.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.910
And this is where we've done a
lot of work with Google to

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.440
make sure that we hit native
quality performance, so you

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.650
can really have a
beautiful gaming

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.540
experience out of the box.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.220
And finally, we think consumers
will benefit because

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.470
there's just going to be a lot
of great games out there.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.710
So we've got over 2,000 games
on mobile, we'd love to see

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.425
them all come to Native
Client, and

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:15.590
we think they will.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:17.370
So why are we--

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.210
you can finish the video--

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.400
why are we here today?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.000
Today we're announcing the
deployment of five Unity

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.230
Native Client games to
the Chrome web store.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.900
And they are two by
SilverTree Media--

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.780
Cordy, which we showed
you, and Sleepy Jack.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.520
Two by Exit Strategy,
Pirates of New

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.690
Horizons and Planet Buster.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.540
And finally, one by a company
called Dedalord.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.320
The game is called
Running Fred.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:47.420
So my colleague Randy will be
over in that pod over there,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.740
demoing all the games.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.330
Really, our message to
developers is you should check

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.750
that Native Client box.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.860
And to the rest of you, enjoy
the games, and I just want to

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.540
really thank Google for the
opportunity to be here.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:08.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:08.222 --> 00:29:11.350
CHRISTIAN STEFANSEN: Right, so
these examples really show how

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:14.940
Native Client can push the
boundaries of what's possible

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.370
on the web.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.930
And on that note, we're really
excited to see several other

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.210
middleware being ported
to Native Client.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.940
These include Unity, of course,
as you've just heard.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.480
It includes Bullet, the physics
engine; Moai, another

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.880
game engine; FMOD and Wwise,
audio engines; and Mono which

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.900
enables you to write your app
in the entire dot net family

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.930
of languages.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.500
And this is really exciting,
because it means the Native

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.080
Client platform is much more
accessible to the hundreds of

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.110
thousands of developers who
are already using these

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.360
middleware products.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.280
So then the question is, well,
what's next for Native Client?

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.290
And I've got it right here.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.370
We are adding features.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.420
We'll be adding more APIs for
networking, in particular for

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:04.590
web sockets.

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:06.910
We're scoping out APIs
for game pads.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.320
I'm sure a lot of people
in the audience will be

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.130
interested in that.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.880
And we're adding more
features, like

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.830
memory mapped files.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.010
This means that when you're
reading or writing large

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.470
files, you can get a performance
increase of orders

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.820
of magnitude, really.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.970
What's more important is to
notice that these interfaces,

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:29.510
the Pepper APIs, are going to
continue to evolve in tandem

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.390
with the web platform.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.310
And what that means is whenever
a new capability is

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:37.420
added to the browser, you would
expect to see JavaScript

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.180
APIs for that capability, and
Pepper APIs for the same

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.540
capability being added at
roughly the same time.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.440
And whenever that does happen,
we're going to make sure to

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.710
have an SDK ready with the
header files, and all you

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.660
need, in the hands of developers
at the time where

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.410
that version of Chrome
is in beta channel.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.860
So you'll have time to develop
apps that take advantage of

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.590
these features before it's
shipped into stable channel.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:08.030
Another key thing for Native
Client has always been

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.840
portability.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.870
And the portability benefits
of the system today are

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.770
already pretty compelling,
but there's more work.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.020
In order really to be as
portable as JavaScript, we

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.910
need to eliminate any barriers
to the introduction of new

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.440
instruction sets or new
operating systems.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.910
And to that end, David
Sehr who's in the

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.050
audience here today--

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:33.800
David, do you want to--

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.770
David Sehr is leading
an effort called

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.950
Portable Native Client.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.930
And Portable Native Client will
introduce an instruction

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:42.850
set mutual wire format to
Native Client, while

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:46.430
maintaining the performance and
the security benefits that

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.290
we've already established
for the system.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.330
And this is really important,
because this means that Native

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.520
Client is going to run, not
just on today's operating

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.610
systems, and today's instruction
set architectures,

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.760
but on the future operating
systems, and future

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.280
instruction set architectures.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.180
So with that, I'd like to invite
Ian back on stage for a

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.620
couple of closing remarks.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.870
Ian.

00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:14.470
IAN ELLISON TAYLOR:
So hopefully--

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:17.650
there's obviously a lot we could
cover, and in the time

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:22.490
available we can only give you
a brief taste of what's

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:23.520
possible in Native Client.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.420
But hopefully we've given you
at least a good sense of how

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.290
we've achieved on some of those
original points that I

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.580
mentioned way back
in the beginning.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.980
How we can really push the
boundary in terms of the kinds

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.560
of applications that you can
run on the web by bringing

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.110
native-like performance.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:44.450
But also maintaining the
portability and the

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.160
scalability, and the reach,
and the deployment

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.380
benefits of the web.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.670
So taking those things together,
and these amazing

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.870
demos, and many others that we
couldn't show, hopefully that

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.250
all comes together into a
pretty compelling story.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:01.330
So we at Google, of course,
are very excited about the

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.660
possibilities and what
we've seen so far.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:07.560
More to the point, hopefully you
are getting excited about

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.470
what you could maybe come
up with that you

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.190
haven't seen today.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:15.620
So I very much look forward to
seeing what kinds of amazing

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.910
experiences you come up with in
the weeks and months ahead,

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:24.230
as we continue to drive
the platform forward.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:29.040
We're going to do some Q&amp;A at
the back in about 10 seconds,

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.120
and hopefully, I think,
get to the beer.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.620
So do stick around, ask me
questions, ask us questions,

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.530
ask our partners questions.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.600
We've obviously got a lot more
we could be working on, and

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.370
your feedback will really help
us set the future direction

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.820
for Native Client.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.580
With that, I'd like to thank--

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.370
wave at our audience in Asia--

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.370
I'm waving at the camera, I
actually have no idea where

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.730
the camera is so I'm just
waving vaguely.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.550
I hope they had a good
video conference.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.660
And, of course, thank you for
coming to Mountain View to

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.510
share in this launch.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.420
Thank you very much.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.847
[APPLAUSE]
