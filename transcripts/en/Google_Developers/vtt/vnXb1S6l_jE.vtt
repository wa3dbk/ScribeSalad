Hello my name is Adam. In this video I ‘ll
show you how to get your app uploaded in the

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.340
web store.
Until the store launches, developers will

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.960
need to use the Chrome Extension gallery’s
upload flow and developer dashboard to upload

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.330
and manage their apps. So, to get your app
in the store, go to the Chrome extensions

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.210
gallery at chrome.google.com/extensions and
click on the “Publish your extensions”

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.960
link on the left.
This will take you to our developer dashboard.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.050
Click “Add new item” to upload a new app.
You’ll then be asked to select the zip file

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:46.629
that contains your app manifest. Select the
file you have created, click "Upload" and

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.050
you’ll be taken to a page where you will
need to provide some additional information

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.789
about your app.
For those of you who have developed extensions,

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.059
you will recognize a lot of the fields you
need to complete, such as uploading screenshots,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.740
selecting the primary language for your app,
providing a detailed descriptions well as

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.610
including links to your website and support
materials. However, we have added a few more

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.270
items on this page.
First of all you can select the price of your

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.390
app - by default this is set as free but you
can change it if you want to. To do so, click

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
on the “Change pricing” button. This will
bring up a panel that lets you select between

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.159
3 pricing options: an option to keep your
app free, &nbsp;an option to use the Chrome Web

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.170
Store’s built in payment mechanism and finally
the option to use a different payment system

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.100
within your app.
The first option is intended for applications

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.329
that never charge any money, apps that are
free from end-to-end.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.149
The second option, using the Chrome Web Store’s
payment mechanism, allows users to pay for

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.079
your app directly within the Web Store. Using
our licensing API you’ll then be able to

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.720
determine whether a given Chrome user who’s
entering your app has paid or not. If you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.550
select this option, you will be asked to define
the price for your app from a set number of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.090
price points. If you’re setting up a subscription-based
service, you can select whether to charge

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.450
users per month or per year.
In addition, you can specify whether users

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.380
can try a free version of the app - we call
this option “free trial”. With this option,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.780
users can instantly start using the free version
of your app. We encourage you to integrate

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.410
free trials because users are often more willing
to spend money for an app after trying it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.020
out.
The third option is intended for apps that

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.150
use a custom payment solution. If you’ve
integrated another payment provider, select

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.520
this option. Also select this option if the
basic version of your app is free but users

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.220
can pay for upgrades, virtual goods or other
services later.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.300
In addition to the pricing options, you’ll
also be asked to select up to 3 app categories

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.760
under which your app should be listed in the
store. To ensure good user ratings for your

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.260
apps make sure to include your app only in
relevant categories. This list will likely

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.920
be updated before our launch, so feel free
to suggest additional categories for your

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.810
app in the free form text box.
Further down, is one more important section

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.450
for apps: We require that you verify the ownership
of the website that your app is hosted on

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.570
using Google’s Webmaster Tools. You will
see the list of verified websites that are

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.730
associated with your account in the dropdown.
To verify additional websites, click the link

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.980
and follow the instructions for Google Webmaster
Tools.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.160
We have a lot more material on different elements
on the upload flow in our documentation located

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.050
at code.google.com/chrome/webstore. We are
looking forward to seeing your apps in the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.150
store!
