LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.890
I'm Louis Gray, here with my
special guest, Chris Wilson

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.350
from the Google Chrome team.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.900
Welcome, Chris.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.150
CHRIS WILSON: Thanks, Louis.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.230
LOUIS GRAY: Chris, this
is a special treat.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170
We both get to stand
up a little bit.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.890
And we're going to talk
about some fun things,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.490
including Web Audio.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.115
We've had you on Google
Developers Live a

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:23.410
couple of times now.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.680
CHRIS WILSON: You have,
actually, to

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.500
talk about Web Audio.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.300
LOUIS GRAY: Talk about
Web Audio.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.200
I mean, this is really a
specialty and a passion for

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.460
you, as you've told me.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.010
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.880
Yes, it is definitely
a passion in my

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.970
personal life, too.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.810
So I kind of carried that
over into my work life.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.740
LOUIS GRAY: And you live
up in Seattle, right?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.070
CHRIS WILSON: I do currently.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.840
Although I'm in the process
of moving down here.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.120
LOUIS GRAY: Seattle's kind of
appropriate, where you let

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.550
your hair down--

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.050
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.040
LOUIS GRAY: --get
the guitar out.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.170
So it all just kind of
works very smoothly.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.380
CHRIS WILSON: Get the whole
grunge look going, and we'll

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.750
see how it works down here.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.550
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000
So on the Chrome team, we really
talk about three things

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.620
most of the time.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.340
And it's speed.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.560
It's simplicity.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.800
And it's security.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.120
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580
LOUIS GRAY: But with the Web
Audio, you're also trying to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.010
make the web do more.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.380
CHRIS WILSON: Absolutely.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.390
LOUIS GRAY: Tell me a little
bit about what's

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.580
going on with Web Audio.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.330
CHRIS WILSON: So one of the
goals with Web Audio was first

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.850
to make it so that we could do
really good audio for gaming,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.310
for any kind of interactive
application where you wanted

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.920
to be able to precisely
time things.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370
You hit the Fire button, you
don't want to hear it sometime

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.810
in the future.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.860
You want to hear it right when
you hit the Fire button.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.320
You want to be able
to do all kinds of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.720
processing on that too.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.605
And you want to be able to
synchronize things together,

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:23.530
too, which has been really
hard to do in the web

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.360
platform, prior to Web Audio.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.890
And now with Web Audio, you
can actually do that.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.890
We also have a really powerful
processing system.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.600
So you can do reverb and another
convolution effects.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.920
You can do filtering effects.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.370
You can place things in a 3D
sound field, and all kinds of

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.940
other neat stuff that is really
interesting for gaming,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.330
of course, like all
those things.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.240
Immersive games really need
those kinds of features.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.060
But you also really want the
ability to do more than that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.610
for kind of regular digital
audio workstation synthesis

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.460
kind of stuff as well.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.540
LOUIS GRAY: Like professional
musicians and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.240
that kind of stuff.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.380
When you look at the verticals
that are here, not only games,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.060
but what other type of people
are really going to be looking

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.660
at Web Audio as a solution
for them?

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.260
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.290
Well, I think that gaming, first
and foremost, was what

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.199
we had to hit just to begin,
just to get off the ground.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.610
And now we're starting to carry
over into some of these

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.930
more professional audio
applications.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.370
And we're starting to see a lot
of people come out of the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.400
woodwork and start building
applications that do things

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.060
like drum machines, and
synthesizers, and other

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.800
processing type stuff as well.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.210
And that's really I think what
I'm here to talk about today,

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.170
is kind of where we've come
since last year at I/O. Last

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.180
year at I/O, I gave a talk
about Web Audio--

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.740
still up on YouTube of course.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.860
Got tons of great information.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.610
I think almost all of that is
still completely relevant and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.630
really a great--

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.200
LOUIS GRAY: But since then,
we've introduced new APIs.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.670
CHRIS WILSON: We
have, actually.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.480
LOUIS GRAY: We've made phones
stronger, faster.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.180
And I think you actually bought
a couple demos for us.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.620
CHRIS WILSON: I did.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.140
LOUIS GRAY: Maybe you can
introduce us to what this demo

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.860
is all about.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.240
CHRIS WILSON: Sure.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.280
LOUIS GRAY: And let's get
the instruments out.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.540
You didn't bring a drum
machine, did you?

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.100
CHRIS WILSON: I didn't bring a
drum machine, although I do

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.630
have a drum machine app
on my demos page.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.950
LOUIS GRAY: No doubt.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.850
CHRIS WILSON: So you
can check it out.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.070
But one of the things I wanted
to start with was when I did

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.670
the Web Audio talk
last year, I was

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.260
exploring the API myself.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.950
And what I did to explore it
was I built a vocoder.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.610
And for anybody who remembers
kind of early '80s synth rock,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.700
a vocoder is like the robotic
voice effect.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.700
So you got this, really it's
a processing effect.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.615
I'm not into tons of details.

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:21.035
LOUIS GRAY: Sort of Kraftwerk
to information society.

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.980
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.270
LOUIS GRAY: I like that stuff
way too much, to be honest.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.760
CHRIS WILSON: The domo arigato
thing, that was all vocoding.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.130
And so vocoding, takes a
frequency analysis of one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.960
audio sound.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.410
And it maps that frequency
analysis over time under a

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.230
different audience sound.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.260
And I did this demo as
part of my talk.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.580
And I didn't go into a ton of
depth, because there was a lot

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.215
of code that I built for it.

00:03:42.215 --> 00:03:44.710
But one of the exciting things
that I was really hoping we

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.070
would get in before I/O last
year, but it missed.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.250
We were in summer I
think, midsummer,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.560
before we got it in--

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.030
was audio input.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.130
So not only can you generate
these sounds on the computer--

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.900
play back pre-recorded audio
snippets or build things with

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.150
synthesis--

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.570
but you can actually get audio
input from the computer.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.550
LOUIS GRAY: From live
audio, as well.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.110
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.440
So you can get the microphone on
your computer or any other

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.190
audio source that's
plugged into it.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.644
LOUIS GRAY: And I understand
you brought an

00:04:09.644 --> 00:04:09.770
audio source today.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.330
CHRIS WILSON: You can use
that and process it.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.320
I did.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.370
LOUIS GRAY: Let's see it.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.850
CHRIS WILSON: I brought a couple
of them, actually.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.890
So we're going to start, I want
to show-- the vocoder was

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.450
the first app that I was like,
as soon as I got a build from

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.800
the developer, I was like,
oh I got to go add this.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.910
And like my wife was there
making dinner.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.850
And I'm like yeah, don't
bother me right now.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:27.550
I'm busy.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.120
I'm busy.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.080
So I got this up and running
in about 20, 25 minutes.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.360
And basically I took this audio
vocoder that I built,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.790
which could work off of a
preprocessed sound source.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.620
So let's play and you can hear
of what it sounds like.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.840
LOUIS GRAY: You're playing that
off the computer now.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.860
CHRIS WILSON: And we're
playing it off the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.650
computer right now.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.040
So this is all being--

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.440
I prerecorded myself talking and
then applied the vocoding

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.020
effect to it.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.260
So now, I can take this and
just click my little live

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.100
input button.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.010
And I have a live
audio source.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.350
LOUIS GRAY: Are you going
to sing for us?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.080
CHRIS WILSON: Check the
microphone, right here.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.900
I'm not going to sing for you.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.510
I actually told one of my
coworkers, singing--

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.540
not really something I'm
prepared to do yet.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.750
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.660
No singing today.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.180
Sorry guys.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.050
CHRIS WILSON: Sorry,
not this time.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.470
So one of the things that we do
here of course, is we have

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.310
to ask, is it OK if we use
your audio input source?

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.810
Because we don't want to let any
random web page pop up and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.070
say, oh sure, you can listen
in to all of your users.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.170
LOUIS GRAY: Oh, absolutely.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.730
Permission first.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.160
Security.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.230
CHRIS WILSON: So permission
first.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.010
Security is always
the theme here.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.770
But now you can tell, I actually
have this vocoder

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.210
effect on my voice.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.110
Everything that I say is running
through this vocoding

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.480
processing effect.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.360
And by the way, all of the code
that I'm doing here--

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.290
and maybe we should stop doing
vocoding effect, because it's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.710
probably a little
bit distracting.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.460
We could use this for the
rest of the talk.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.920
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.380
CHRIS WILSON: But all of this
processing is actually being

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.560
done by the Web Audio API.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.910
My own code actually
just sets up this

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.640
whole network of nodes.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400
And then the audio processing
API does everything.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.980
The only bit of my JavaScript
code that's running right now

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.770
is the stuff that animates that
neat little visual effect

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.570
on the screen.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.580
So the next thing though, like
the next thing that I built

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.460
after I added this into the
vocoder, was just started

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.580
playing with some
input effects.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.980
LOUIS GRAY: And which
input is this?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.560
CHRIS WILSON: So this is still
pulling off the microphone.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.070
And it's just a few simple
effects, like delay.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.680
But I'm going to turn this
off for a second.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.210
And one of the things that is
really important to understand

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.910
is that input isn't
just microphones.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.460
It's not just the mic that's
plugged into your computer.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.390
So what I've got hooked up here
is just a standard USB

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.880
audio input.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.330
But I have the ability
to plug-in

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.990
different audio sources.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.560
And I brought along
my trusty guitar.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.480
LOUIS GRAY: That's
a nice guitar.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.980
Are you going to
show everybody?

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.290
CHRIS WILSON: It is
a nice guitar.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.150
This is my baby.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.460
This is one of my babies.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.340
This is my electric baby.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.120
But so what I've got
running off here--

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.120
and I'm going to pick a
different sound here, just so

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.250
we can see it.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.060
What I've got running here is
just a regular, quarter-inch

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.290
output out of my guitar, run
straight into the USB audio.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.660
In fact, I can change
the effect mix here.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.690
And you can hear what
it sounds like.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.030
It's kind of twangy.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.170
It's standard kind of thing.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.870
But if I crank the effects mix
up, what you'll hear is me

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.670
playing running through effects
that are all being

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.550
done in Web Audio.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.280
I just set up a bunch of nodes
to do various things in here.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.650
So this is my bass effects.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.500
I didn't want to bring my bass
along because that was way too

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.750
much to take on the plane.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.210
LOUIS GRAY: And while you're
doing that, we can all see the

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.880
visual running through the
computer at the same time.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.290
CHRIS WILSON: Yeah.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.190
So I've already talked about one
of the first things we had

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.500
to do was this precise
timing of audio.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.920
We had to give you the ability
to precisely schedule things,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.560
set them up, synchronize them,
do things together.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.580
And I've got a bunch of other
really great stuff too that I

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.980
don't want to get into today,
because it takes a while.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.430
But there's lot of powerful
stuff you can do with that

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.580
scheduling.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.000
And then we added all this
processing stuff.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.840
Like the things you're seeing
here are all filters and

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.580
convolution effects, distortion
using wave shaping,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.510
and things like that.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.580
But the last thing that the Web
Audio API really has is a

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.220
great ability to do analysis,
like we have built in

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.210
FFT-based frequency analysis.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.800
LOUIS GRAY: What kind
of analysis?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.799
CHRIS WILSON: So you can
actually see as I'm playing

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.940
here, this is a frequency
break down.

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.150
In fact, I can switch this
to just a straightforward

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.230
frequency graph.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.309
And you can see the rich
harmonics because this wah

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.520
bass effect is actually trimming
off all the higher

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.010
frequencies.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.080
It clips all the stuff that's on
there to the right, because

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.250
of course, lower frequencies
are on the left here.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:53.930
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.340
CHRIS WILSON: But if I switch to
something else, like just a

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.610
distorted effect, you can see
the distorted effect has lots

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.450
of high-end energy.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.980
And this is all being done, all
of the analysis of this is

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.280
being done, by the
Web Audio API.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.450
So I have code of course, that
goes in and pulls the numbers

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.410
out and draws them
on the screen--

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.610
draws them on an HTML5 canvas.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.720
But I'm not actually having to
do the processing of the bits

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.646
in JavaScript.

00:09:18.646 --> 00:09:20.460
LOUIS GRAY: A lot of this, this
is programs that you've

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.080
written based on the
Web Audio API.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:23.960
Now, a couple of questions.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.000
Number one, is the Web Audio API
always available in every

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.760
Chrome install, or is
it something else

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.610
you have to go get?

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.030
CHRIS WILSON: It's
a great question.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.730
The Web Audio API is actually
available in

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.850
Chrome across the board.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.370
It's not something
you need to add.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.950
As I showed before, you do have
to, your users have to

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.140
allow microphone input,
live audio input.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.850
They have to say it's OK to be
able to get access to that.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.835
LOUIS GRAY: And then the second
thing I was going to

00:09:47.835 --> 00:09:50.390
ask is, how do developers
get started with this?

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.570
If there's somebody who really
wants to either look through

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.380
the Web Audio API to add it to
their games, or find some

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.540
other way to manipulate sound,
what do they do?

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.870
CHRIS WILSON: I think
there are a lot of

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.890
demos out there now.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.590
There's a lot of code
out there now.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.230
All of these things
by the way, are on

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.480
webaudiodemos.appspot.com.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.190
You actually just search
for Web Audio demos.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.570
This comes up.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:10.260
LOUIS GRAY: It can
be number one.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.470
CHRIS WILSON: This is
number one, I think.

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:12.990
I'm pretty sure this is
still number one.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.310
LOUIS GRAY: In all
major engines.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.940
CHRIS WILSON: Yes.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.880
And this has a whole
bunch of my demos.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.710
You can see most of these
have a link to

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.060
the Repro and GitHub.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.610
These are all open
source stuff.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.930
You can take it in and do
whatever you want with it.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.240
But I forgot where
I was going now.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.710
LOUIS GRAY: You were
talking about how

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.470
we're going to develop.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.520
You said it's on GitHub.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.600
You can find it at web.appspot.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.340
Yeah.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.000
CHRIS WILSON: The one thing I
did want to say is, one of the

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.900
other things and I'm really
excited about this year is

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.750
we're just on the cusp of
getting all this stuff into

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.880
Chrome for Android.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.260
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:43.870
I was going to ask
about mobile.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.890
Yes.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.530
CHRIS WILSON: We're starting to
get all of this processing

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.630
power on the web platform on
mobile devices as well.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.370
LOUIS GRAY: Interesting.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.250
CHRIS WILSON: This is a much
more challenging thing to do,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.380
because there's a broad spectrum
of devices and audio

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.560
hardware and those devices.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.880
LOUIS GRAY: But there's been
some of that simplicity.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.640
CHRIS WILSON: But it's
super powerful.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.740
LOUIS GRAY: You had Android
studio, that just came out

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.870
which is going really help
people be able to code Android

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.730
applications against many
different models and types and

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.850
see how that works.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.440
And as you look in Chrome,
Chrome came off Android not

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.140
too long ago.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.010
It's out on IOS as well now.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.050
And it's very interesting to
see that once you start

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.900
writing for a specific platform,
and that platform

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.920
becomes available to different
people on different operating

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.030
systems and different handsets,
it's just really

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.400
ubiquitous.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.080
And it's available everywhere.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.780
CHRIS WILSON: Exactly.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.170
That's really the thing had me
really excited about Web Audio

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.970
from the beginning, was the idea
that eventually, we would

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.130
get this everywhere.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.630
We would get it as a ubiquitous
platform.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.840
I don't need to have a
particular device.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.950
I actually, as I've been
preparing to move, I've been

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.210
packing up my studio.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.640
And I've had to think through
each piece like, am I really

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.060
going to need this anymore?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.660
Because by the time I unpack,
I could rebuild a bunch of

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:49.970
this stuff just as
Web Audio APIs.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.630
And I don't really
need to drag the

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.160
hardware around anymore.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.450
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.070
CHRIS WILSON: Like what I
brought here with me today,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.940
what I brought with me down to
I/O, was basically just a USB

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.780
audio input, one microphone,
one guitar, and no effects

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.170
boxes or anything like that.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:05.630
LOUIS GRAY: Awesome.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.320
CHRIS WILSON: And I can still
there are tons of neat stuff.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.800
LOUIS GRAY: Thank you for
bringing all that stuff over.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.010
Thanks for joining us
with your guitar--

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.350
CHRIS WILSON: Thank
you for having me.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.720
LOUIS GRAY: --and all
of your equipment.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.830
It seems like we ran really
fast through this.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.340
So I definitely want
people to check out

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.890
webaudio.appspot.com.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.480
CHRIS WILSON: Webaudiodemos.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.190
LOUIS GRAY: Webaudiodemos,
thank you--

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.140
webaudiodemos.appspot.com.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.330
Thanks for joining me, Chris.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.390
We have Chris on a regularly
on GDL and

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.480
all the Chrome team.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.990
So definitely follow us at
developers.google.com/live,

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.550
and subscribe to Google
Developers on YouTube.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.980
We're going to be right back in
a couple of minutes to talk

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.550
about YouTube, and the Sandbox,
and wrap our I/O

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.800
programming.
