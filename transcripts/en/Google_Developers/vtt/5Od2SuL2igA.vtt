00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.620
ANKIT JAIN: Good morning,
everyone.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.680
Morning.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.980
So great to see so many of you
here so early on day three of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.720
Google I/O. Last night I wasn't
sure if I was going to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.400
make it this early.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.460
My name is Ankit Jain and
I lead [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.530
Search &amp; Discovery
for Google Play.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.210
And I'm extremely excited to
be here and share this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.940
material with you today.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.960
As most of you know, we've never
discussed our search or

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.530
discovery engines publicly
before today.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.140
But before I get started, I
wanted to get to know you guys

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.890
a little better.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.580
So with a raise of hands, how
many of you are making money

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.520
on Google Play today?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.685
OK, great.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:41.590
How many of you would like
to make even more

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.880
money on Google Play?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.300
Great.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.410
For those on YouTube, pretty
much everyone would like to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.130
make even more money.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.810
Let's step out of our normal
role as developers or business

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.560
owners, and for a second, let's
step into the shoes of

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.610
our users, and think
like a user when

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.910
you come to the store.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.700
How many of you have installed
an app, just while browsing.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.860
You were bored, you opened the
Play Store, saw something

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.780
interesting, click through
and installed it?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.690
OK, how many of you have
installed an app because you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.410
thought about, I need to get
something done, I need a

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.000
recipe app or I need to find
the train schedule, went

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810
looked for it, and then
installed it.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.040
That's a smaller portion.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.980
And how many of you have
installed an app because a

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.590
friend of yours told you, hey,
you really have to go check

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.450
out this app.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.780
And then you go to the Store,
look for it, and install it.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.080
Great, so my goal today is to
talk to you about how we try

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.520
to bring these online and
offline thought processes of

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.430
how all of us install apps,
and how we try to get that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.510
discovered on Play.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.210
So I'm going to present you with
three high-level sets of

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.860
information.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.970
The first one is our vision for
the new Google Play Store,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.620
the second is some of the
details of the Search &amp;

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.700
Discovery algorithms that we
have, and how you can take

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.510
advantage of them to get
discovered more, and, finally,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.560
I want to leave you with five
very concrete examples of what

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.490
you can do to get discovered
more on Play.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.780
Sounds good?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.480
All right, great.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.180
So let's get right into it.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.540
A few weeks ago, we rolled out
the new version of the Google

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.580
Play Store.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.960
It's very different than what
we had in the past.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.170
About a year ago a group of us
stepped aside and said, if we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.420
could re-imagine the entire
Store, the new Google Play

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.540
experience, what would
it be like?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540
The goal was to come up with
something that was dynamic,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.140
very fresh, the user should be
trained and look forward to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.870
coming back into the Store,
something that is

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.400
personalized, yet personal.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.720
So some of you might
be thinking, Ankit,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.960
what are you saying?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.470
Personalized, yet personal,
what's the difference there?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.600
Well, personalized to me is
something that is personally

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.350
relevant, related to what you've
told us in the past,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.660
what you users have purchased;
what's personally relevant,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.210
because it's popular in the
user's area; personally

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.920
relevant because the user has
shown interest in certain

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.860
categories or in certain
developers; or personally

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.880
relevant because your
friends are showing

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.180
interest in those things.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.140
And then we want to take it to
the next level, we want to

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.250
make it personal by showing
you and annotating each of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.130
these recommendations or each
of the pieces of content in

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.190
our Store with why you
should get it.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.810
This could be a +1 by a friend,
this could be a review

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.110
by a friend, or this could be
something based on the new

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.810
Google Play Game services.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.590
That should be and three others
are currently playing

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.720
"Puzzles and Dragons."

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.240
We should really tell the user
this is why you should get.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.520
And our goal was to help each
and every one of you, each and

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.940
every one of our developers,
to get more engaged

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.270
installers, because at the end
of the day, that's what's

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.790
really going to move
the needle.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.010
Those are the users that build
sustainable and great

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.780
businesses.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.330
So our goal was threefold.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.240
First, to help our users find
what they're looking for as

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.500
effortlessly and seamlessly,
and possible.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.400
Second, to help Android ship
more and more beautiful apps.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.810
And finally, to help all of you
build even more thriving

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.240
businesses on top
of our platform.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.340
So let's get the meat
of today's talk.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.250
Let's talk about our major
install source.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.080
At the end of the day,
nothing can be built

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.130
unless you've got installs.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.660
And specifically, I want
to talk about how

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.800
to get engaged installs.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.529
So many of you reached out to me
in the past and said, hey,

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.180
I'm ranked number five, or
number 10, or number 50 on

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.750
these top lists, or on
these trending lists.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.510
These are what I call our
browsing discovery features.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.030
And I like to break them into
three sub-components.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.020
The first are these top charts,
the top list, the

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.940
editor's picks, the
trending lists.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.120
The next are the features
that we launched at

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.550
Google I/O last year.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.740
These were the personalized
recommendations.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.490
Some of you saw these as part
of the Google Play homepage

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.440
experience in the cluster there,
others might have seen

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.490
this on the widgets, on the
Nexus 7 and the Nexus 10 on

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.790
the home screens there.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.160
And the last set of features
that we have for discovery

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.050
based on your context, are the
related and cross sell items.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.150
These are the users who viewed
x, also viewed y on the

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.070
details page of all
of your app.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.150
Also the other set which is
users who installed this app

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.270
also installed these other apps,
which is also on your

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.290
details pages.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.370
And we'll get into details about
each of these and how we

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.310
look at them, and how the
algorithms are built.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.160
What most developers don't think
to think about as much

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.280
is the search component.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.940
And for the average app search
actually makes up the vast

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.730
majority of installs.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.410
And when I think about search,
I like to break it down and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.330
look at our query stream in
terms of two kinds of queries.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.890
The first are the kinds of
queries that many of you

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.700
raised your hand for, which
are I had to get something

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.270
done, so I looked it up; I
needed to look up a recipe; I

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.210
wanted to find restaurant
reviews in a city that I'm in;

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.450
I want to find multiplayer
games or free

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.030
games, or RPG games--

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.705
the kind of categorical
queries.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.570
You know the general idea of
what you want or what you want

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.460
to do, and then you search
to find the right

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.830
app to fulfill that.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.590
The second kind of query is
when you know exactly what

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.750
you're looking for.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.810
This is when a friend has told
you about an app, or if you've

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.800
heard about it through
marketing.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.560
Navigational queries, hey, I
want to get hotel tonight; I

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.120
want to get "Beautylish," or I
want to get "Angry Birds,"

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.840
which is not necessarily a
single app, it could be a set

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.640
of apps, but you know which
direction you want to look in.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.040
That's navigational queries.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.700
And just to show you how
important search is, in any

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.960
given day 12% of our active
users come back to the Store

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.110
and search at least
once for apps.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.660
In any given week, half of our
users come to our Store and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.360
search for apps.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.580
And even given the number of
apps we have in any given

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.670
month, there's over six million
unique phrases that

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.500
are being searched for.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.810
So really thinking about search
is important, as you

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.190
try to figure out how to
get discovered on Play.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.600
So just to put what we've talked
about, we've talked

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.420
about our vision for Google
Play, and how our goal is to

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.360
present each user with a
personalized play made

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.410
personal; how Search and
Browse are the two main

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.080
sources of installs in the
Store; and finally, a lot of

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.390
this happens because our goal
is to bring the rest

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.220
of Google to Play.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.860
That was the transition from
Android Market into Google

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.850
Play, it was to integrate all
of our systems together and

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.180
make Google Play a very smart
Store, make it your store.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.820
So now that we've talked about
it, let's step back and think

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.030
about how we think of our Search
&amp; Discovery systems.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.490
When we build our search engines
and our discovery

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.930
engines, we have two options--
either we can spend a lot of

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.010
time trying to detect the apps
that are bad or spammy, or

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.740
simply annoying, or we can spend
a lot of time trying to

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.550
figure out which
apps are good.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.960
And we spend a lot more time
focusing on what's good,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.880
because if we can promote the
apps that are not just good

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.740
from what we can tell, based
on your APK, based on your

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.650
metadata, based on what users
are telling us about each of

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.900
the apps, then other users are
also going to find these

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.750
delightful experiences.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.260
And so this part of the talk is
going to be talking about

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.020
how you can compliment your app
with good app metadata.

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.130
So the most important
piece of your app

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.820
metadata is your title.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.110
It's important to be creative,
but it's just as important, if

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.170
not more important, to
been very clear.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.590
So this example up on screen
is about an app named

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.100
"Beautylish." As you can see,
most of you might not have

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.220
heard of it, some of you might
have heard of it, but right

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.330
after you see the title, you
know this app is about makeup

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.450
and beauty tips.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.120
So what this title helps you do
is it helps the developer

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.429
reinforce, not just their
branding, but also what their

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:36.340
app is about.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.809
So as you see this more and
more often, either in the

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.850
Store, or even once you have it
installed in your list of

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.760
apps on your home screen, it's
very clear that "Beautylish"

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.280
is the app I go to for makeup
and beauty tips.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.160
So I highly recommend thinking
about the name of your app.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.600
It also helps a lot for SEO.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.220
When someone looks up "beauty
tips" or "makeup tips", these

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.900
guys are at the top of that
list, just because everyone

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.070
associates the two of those
terms together.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.050
The next important part of
your details page in your

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.880
metadata is your description.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.990
You can write as long a
description as you want, but I

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.060
always say, get the main
message out first.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.790
"Star Chart" does a
great job here.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.150
Their first sentence says that
you can now have a virtual

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.070
planetarium in your pocket.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.790
Again, if you've never used
this app, you already know

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.420
what it's about.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.120
After that, you can go on
describe it in more detail,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.110
list the awards you have, and
just have your sales and

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.680
marketing pitches for users.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.050
But right up front, make
sure your user knows

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.060
what your app is about.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.320
And on a smaller phone, that's
the part that's above the

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.280
fold, so you want to make sure
on that first screen itself

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.860
it's extremely clear what your
goal is-- what utility you

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.605
provide or what entertainment
value or whatever the goal of

00:09:51.605 --> 00:09:53.190
your app is-- what
it provides.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.260
Now, that also again helps
a lot with getting found.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.690
This app is extremely optimized
for star charts,

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.050
star maps, virtual planetariums,
so the beginning

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.020
of descriptions are extremely
important, both from a user's

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.690
perspective, and also from our
search engine's perspective.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.590
The next couple of slides I'm
going to talk about how you

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.980
can use your app details page
to mimic the real user

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.030
experience.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.450
It's important that you set the
expectations of your user

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.590
to be very realistic to really
be what your app

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.820
is going to be like.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.040
The first place to do this
is in your screenshots.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.320
In our developer console, we let
you upload screenshots for

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.530
tablets, for phones, and really
show the user what it's

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.950
going to be like once
you install the app.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.700
Now, if you don't do this, and
your app experience is

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.100
actually very different from
your screenshots, it can have

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.160
a very negative effect on
all of your systems.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:44.420
Why?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.410
Because, well, the user loves
what they see in your details

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.180
page, they install your app,
they open the app, and then

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.750
they see something
very different.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.130
What are they going to do?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.050
Well, most users will
uninstall the app.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.710
Some of those users will go back
to the Store and give you

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.290
a low rating, maybe even write
you a negative review.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.920
And that negative feedback cycle
is going to hurt you

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.110
more than help you.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.350
And so really thinking about
how do you present the user

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.970
with, setting the right
expectation and then

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:14.210
delivering on it.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.140
That's the message here.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.930
We're looking for apps that do
deliver on their promises.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:24.280
Video previews are the next
level of screenshots.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.560
With a short video you're able
to show the user really what

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.030
it's like to play
with your app.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.240
And developers have told us
that uploading a video can

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.270
really help gain
user adoption.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.870
And users in a lot of studies
have told us that video

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.440
previews are amongst the most
convincing features of an app

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.990
details page.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.460
Again, the whole goal here
is to tell your user

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.710
what your app does.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.070
If you can convince them and
make sure and communicate what

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.200
your app promises and then
deliver on it, you're going to

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.260
delight them, and they're going
to recommend you to

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:56.510
other users as well.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.090
So I talked about reviews and
ratings in terms of the

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.070
feedback loop.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.840
And this is a key part of our
Search &amp; Discovery experience.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.220
Now, the first piece of this
comes because people come back

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.760
and review your app, whether
it's good or bad.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.810
The second piece is we really
try to order our reviews and

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.230
ratings in an order that is
relevant to the user.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.120
So you're going to see reviews
that are on the same device as

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.730
the current user, in the same
country as the current user,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.310
and as time goes on, people that
are in a user's circle or

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.020
people that the users trust are
going to come at the top

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.830
of these reviews.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.220
So investing in making sure that
your users are reviewing

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.070
and rating your apps will be
key going forward, because

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.720
that's a very strong signal
for us at Google Play.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.920
So I'm going to step back and
tell you a story about a

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.400
developer, a developer in India
that I was talking to a

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.980
few weeks ago.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.530
And his goal was to target
the rural population.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.340
As you can see on the graph
on the right, about 75% of

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.980
India's population lives
in rural cities.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.140
But his goal was to target the
audience that had low- to

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.390
mid-end phones, and was on
slow to 2G networks.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.890
So he had really optimized his
app to give a delightful

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.260
experience for these users.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.970
But then he reached out to me
and said, Ankit, when I look

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.850
at my reviews, I have
this polarized view.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.680
There's a whole bunch of stars
with people saying I could

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.700
never have imagined technology
would change

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.950
my world this way.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.230
And also a lot of one stars,
with people saying, complete

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.620
crap, I can't believe I
downloaded this, uninstalling

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.470
it right now.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.800
And he was perplexed, he wasn't
sure what was going on.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.340
And we dug a little deeper.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.240
And one of the things we
noticed was that he was

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.170
getting a lot of positive
reaction from the people in

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.390
rural areas, his target
audience.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.450
And he was getting a lot of
negative reviews from the

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.260
people on the 4G networks, on
the top-of-the-line devices

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.270
because his app just was
not designed for them.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.160
His goal was not to go
after that market.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.140
And so the thing that he ended
up doing was he went to the

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.360
developer console and targeted
his app to the countries and

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.740
carriers where his target
audience really was.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.110
And since then, he's already
seen an uptick in his average

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.350
reading and his reviews,
and hopefully that

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.230
continues over time.

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.490
But my message here to you
is think about who

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.020
you're trying to target.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.550
For most apps, you don't have
to worry about this, you can

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.890
let your app get to everybody.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.430
But if your app is targeted at
a specific set of the target

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.710
audience, make sure those are
the people helping you get

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:26.660
even more adoption.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.810
You don't want people not in
your target audience polluting

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.520
your reviewer rating.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.980
So we've talked about creating
a very creative, yet clear

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.680
message to your title and
description, to mimic your

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.520
real world experience through
your images, your screenshots

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.210
and your video previews; and,
finally, really about

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.650
understanding your audience.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.660
This is what's going to
help you optimize

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.080
your app details page.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.830
So let's see how this
manifests itself.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.080
At the end of the day, there's
the top charts and the search

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.650
engines, what are the things
that we look for?

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.300
How, once you do all of these
great things in your app

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.400
details page, how does
it feedback?

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.830
And no search or discovery
system would be complete

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.650
without really taking into
account the statistics that

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.650
we're constantly collecting.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.130
So the first piece of this, as
most of you probably already

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.780
figured out, are the installs.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.450
Of course, we care about how
many installs each app has.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.910
The more you have, the higher up
in the rankings you'll go.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.960
We also care about how many
uninstalls you have, because

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.070
that's a metric for us to know
whether users are having a

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.690
good or a bad experience.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.030
Now, some of you are game
developers out there, and you

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.240
might say, hey, my game overall
takes 1 gig of memory,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.280
or 2 gigs of memory on
a person's device.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.460
So after they're done playing
my game, of course, they're

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.390
going to uninstall my app,
because they want to

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.120
play the next game.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.130
They've already won every
level there is.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.020
Why are you going to hurt me?

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.670
And that's why we have
the third statistic,

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:51.240
which is long installs.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.770
If a person plays through or
uses an app for a long period

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.630
of time, we don't want
to penalize it.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.010
Our goal is really to detect the
behavior which is, hey, I

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.760
installed the app, I really
did not have a good

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.040
experience, so I'm installing
it right away.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.560
So the long install
encapsulates that

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.050
phenomenon in it.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.820
In the coming months, one of
the things that we want to

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.680
focus on is engagement, and
really understanding, for each

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.560
of your apps, when are people
using, how are they using it,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.720
and how is it different across
different kinds of apps.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.200
For example, Google Now, I just
go to it when I need to

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.460
pick up my latest
boarding pass.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.370
I'm not going to spend tens if
not tens of minutes or hours

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.390
on it, but there might be a game
where I spend an hour or

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.190
two on it, but that doesn't
mean one is

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:32.940
better than the other.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.420
They're just different
kinds of functions

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.680
that they're providing.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.240
And this is an area where having
a conversation with all

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.250
of you is great, and I really
look forward to having some of

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:41.870
your feedback.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.090
So a lot of this is about
setting the stage for the

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.750
first conversation we've never
discussed this before.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.910
If you guys have ideas,
please let us know.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.390
I'll talk about Google Play
services, the game services,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.090
that we launched, and how we're
going to use that for

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.280
engagement in the coming
months as well.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.670
Here's a query that I get very
often from developers.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.099
Hey, for some search query, I'm
number three, even though

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:10.220
the app ranked above mine has
fewer installs and has a lower

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.390
rating than me.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:16.069
I'm sure many of you have
thought about this as well .

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.829
Now, on the previous slide
I talked about

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.150
the uninstall rate.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.380
Not only do we look at the
number of people that are

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.150
uninstalling your app compared
to the number of people

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.390
installing it, we also have
some amount of a recent

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.550
uninstall rate as well.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.680
The idea here is that you might
have an app that has not

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.300
been updated in a couple of
years, and now more people are

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.510
uninstalling your app
than installing it.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.720
Or there's a newer app or your
app could be on the other side

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.800
of this, where you made an
update and now a lot of people

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.210
are really keeping your app,
that's going to help you move

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:48.980
up in the rankings.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:52.960
We want to make sure our users
are getting the best apps as

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.150
easily as possible.

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.210
So I hope this answers
this very common

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.460
question that I get.

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.470
So the other piece of what we've
talked about a lot at

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.130
Google I/O this year is
personalization across all of

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.180
our products at Google,
and Google plays no

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.470
exception to this.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.400
We're constantly slicing and
dicing all of the data that

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.920
we're collecting in order to
personalize and improve each

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.520
user's experience.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.980
I'll give you a couple
of examples.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.360
The query "Yahoo" in the US
leads to people installing the

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.180
Yahoo app or the
Yahoo Mail app.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.785
In Japan, however, people are
installing the Yahoo Japan

00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:33.500
app, and over time our systems
learned this and figured out,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.020
hey, in Japan, show Yahoo Japan
as number one, in the US

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.860
show Yahoo and Yahoo Mail
as number one and two.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.630
Similarly, on tablets, people
tend to install different apps

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.320
than they do on mobile
devices.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.670
So, again, using the feedback
loops of what people are

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.510
searching for, what they're
clicking on, and what they're

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.380
enjoying installing, we're
able to really tailor the

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.390
search experience and the search
results per device

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.180
type, per locale, and across
a whole bunch of different

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.430
dimensions.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.660
About a year ago, in addition
to having the search

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.020
suggestions as you type, we
added the ability to have

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.000
navigational search
suggestions.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.890
These are suggestions that
Google believes are the right

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.060
one for a user.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.750
So as this user is typing in
SUB, most users tend to

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.210
actually go straight to "Subway
Surfers," so we

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:22.740
allowed the user to do
that right from the

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.730
search suggest box.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.820
If you click on that
navigational suggestion, you

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.170
won't go to a search
results page.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.380
You'll go straight to the
app's details page.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.310
It even shows you the icon of
the app that it's going to

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.600
take you straight to.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.970
Now, if a user wants to find the
tips or the strategies, or

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.450
other apps that are around
"Subway Surfers," they can

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.220
still complete their query and
look at the app details page.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.510
Again, the theme here is that
we're trying to make it easier

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.920
for users to get
what they want.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.820
Let's switch gears
a little bit.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.150
And I'll let you look at this
for a couple of seconds,

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:55.400
there's a lot of
data up there.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.030
So a lot of you always have
asked the question, how are

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.290
your top lists generated?

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.320
When are they generated?

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.770
And what's the rationale
behind them?

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.680
Now, not like any search or
discovery system, we're

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:18.980
constantly tuning our systems.

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.370
And this is a snapshot of what
it looks like recently.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:28.025
There's a basic quality barrier
that's there, there

00:20:28.025 --> 00:20:30.370
are some review and rating
metrics that we take into

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.920
account, but at a high level, we
create top lists daily per

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.880
country, per category, and
even for device type.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.840
You guys saw some of the design
for tablet top list

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.930
that were launched
earlier at I/O.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.100
And our top paid free and
grossing list are really

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.100
targeting first-time users to
Google Play, or people that

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.850
just got a new device, because
they're looking for the basic

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:52.650
apps that they need to
load up in order to

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.550
get their stuff done.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.860
What's most popular
on Google Play?

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.120
The top new paid and the top new
list are targeting users

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.860
who have the basic apps and
say, hey, what's new right

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:03.940
now, what's new and popular?

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.270
And for that reason we limit it
to the apps that have been

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.220
published in the last 30 days.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.220
And this is very important,
because many app developers

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.320
launch an app in a single
country and then over time

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.470
roll it out to a bunch
of countries.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.420
So I get a question a lot of
times saying, hey, I just

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.830
launched in Italy last week,
and it's going gangbusters.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.850
We're just getting more installs
than we ever have,

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.800
how come we're not in the
top and new free or

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.290
top new paid list?

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.630
Well, the reason is your
original launch might have

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.350
been six months ago, and so
you're not qualified to be in

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:40.510
the top new list of even new
countries that you launch in.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.990
It's a global published
date that we look at.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.170
So also think about your global
roll-out strategy.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.900
If being in the top new list is
part of your strategy, that

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.800
30-day window is extremely
important.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.050
And the metrics across these
are different, for the

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.860
grossing we look at the
revenues, for the others look

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:02.390
at installs over the
last several days.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.200
The next list that I want to
talk about is our trending

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.440
list, and this is one that has
had no clarity about it ever.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.110
Internally, we like to call it
our Movers &amp; Shakers list.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.390
Our goal here is to present the
user with a system that

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.800
can give them what's really
hot right now.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.120
Amongst all the apps on Google
Play, what are the apps that a

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.980
lot of users, more than we
predict, are being installed?

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.540
So for every app we have a
predicted growth rate.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.570
This predicted growth rate takes
into consideration where

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.860
in your app life cycle
you are, and how many

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.460
installs you have.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.190
And then, if a given app
performs significantly better,

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.730
if it starts getting installs
much faster than what we

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.530
predict, it makes it
into this movers &amp;

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.160
shakers, or trending list.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.300
So when the soccer World Cup was
going on a couple of years

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.060
ago, the FIFA app was at
the top of this list.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.220
Last year when the unfortunate
tsunami hit Japan, many

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.480
radiation tracking apps were
on the top of this list.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.910
And any app can be part
of this list.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.270
And we're looking at a 30-day
window to figure out really

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.670
what's hot right now.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:10.510
I mentioned the Related
and Cross Sell

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.390
features that we have.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.650
These are on every app's
details page.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.160
They are the people who viewed
this, also viewed these other

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.450
apps, and the users who
installed this app, also

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.740
installed these other apps.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.630
Let's go through
a few examples.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.300
The first one's Bank
of America, a user

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.770
looking to do banking.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.620
When they're considering a
banking app, they might

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.790
consider other banking apps-
Paypal or Wells Fargo, but

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.790
once they've decided to get
the Bank of America app,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.500
they're more likely to install
a complementary app, not a

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.720
supplementary app.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.760
So here you see them installing
a trading app, such

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.050
as "Merill Edge," or another app
by the same developer the

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.170
BOFA Health app.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.520
In the middle is an example of a
user looking to get a Bible.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.720
Users looking to get a Bible
might consider the various

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.630
options, but once they get the
Bible, they'll get other

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.750
religious apps, not other
Bible apps, so it's

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.970
complementary to what they've
already gotten.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:03.670
The third example is a widget
that helps users show the time

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:04.720
on their home screen.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.260
They might consider "Digiclock"
or "Dashclock" but

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.760
once they instal the "Dashclock"
widget, they've

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.070
bought into that style, that
ecosystem, so then they're

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.890
more likely to install other
widgets or other add-ons that

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.520
have the same style, to have
the unified experience on

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.770
their Android device.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.470
Last year at Google I/O we
launched Personalized

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.010
Recommendations.

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.480
As I said, these were on the
home screen of the Google Play

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.910
homepage and they've been
performing extremely well.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.160
And with the new launch of
Google Play, we really decided

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.690
to double down on this and
start personalizing many

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.760
different parts of our system.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.810
So I thought it's a good
opportunity for me to tell you

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:43.970
what really we look for.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.530
We have over 80 signals not
just from Google Play, but

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.160
also from the rest of Google.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.630
But some of our major signals
include apps that are

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.360
complementary and supplementary
to apps that

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.820
users installed in the past.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.510
We look at apps that are popular
in the user's area.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.860
We look at apps that are being
+1'd by a user's circles.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.370
Apps that were reviewed
by a user's circles.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.682
We also look at apps that are
developed by some of you, if

00:25:07.682 --> 00:25:10.960
the users are already showing
interest in your developer

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.610
account, by other apps by you.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.770
So here are some recommendations
for three

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:17.670
different users.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.790
You can see +1s by
people's friends.

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.310
You can see apps that are
similar to other things

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.270
they've bought, also apps that
are popular in their area.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.860
So how does this manifest
itself?

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.290
So this is the homepage
that we envision.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.380
This is going to start rolling
out to different users over

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.280
the coming months.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.010
On the left, is my grandmother's
home page, that'

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.310
what she sees.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.310
She grew up very close to
military quarters in India,

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:46.430
because my grandpa lived
in that area.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.140
And she was very interested
in getting stuff done.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.840
We call her the colonel
of the family.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.960
So for her actually the tasklist
makes so much sense.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.250
But growing up in a military
area also means that you play

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.210
a lot of cards.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.480
She actually plays two to four
hours of card games a day.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.740
It's ridiculous, I don't
know how she does it.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.420
And so seeing the tablet
highlight apps for her, and

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.390
seeing the card game right
up there is really what's

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:13.520
relevant to her.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.650
For me, I travel a lot, and so
on the tablet highlights

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.390
section not only do you see
Google Translate, which I

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.560
should get so that I can
communicate with people all

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.310
around the world.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.650
But it also tells me why.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.030
It tells me that my
friend Abinahm has

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:25.890
+1'd this app here.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.120
He had a great experience, so
that helps me improve trust in

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.750
the system and get this app.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.240
You can take this a step
further, on all four category

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.480
homepages both of these
are for me.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.230
On the left, I live in San
Francisco, so you see the San

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.810
Francisco Giants app, you see
the Oakland Baseball app, you

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.860
see Sacramento Kings app,
on the right is

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.740
the news home page.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.970
You see news apps and magazine
apps that are related to what

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:52.920
I bought in the past.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.250
I have "Pulse" and people who
have "Pulse tend to also enjoy

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.840
"New York Times." It's amazing
to me that "Times of India"

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.980
comes on my personalized home
page, but it wouldn't on some

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.340
of yours just because my friends
tend come from that

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.280
part of the world, and they
say this is a great

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.630
app to adopt it.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.760
How can we apply personalization
to search?

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.920
I've talked about using
location, so a user in Japan

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.590
will see different results for
Yahoo than a user in the US.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.600
But we think categorical queries
are a place where we

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.370
can really help the user find
what they're looking for.

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.520
Imagine the user researches
for free games.

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.700
If we know that they like word
games, showing them free word

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.480
games makes a lot of sense.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.750
If they like RPG games, showing
them those kind of

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:42.150
games is going to help get a
much faster acquisition rate.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:46.200
For train schedules, a user in
New York should get the subway

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.060
train schedule, a user in San
Francisco should get either

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.490
the BART train schedule or
the Caltrain schedule.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:52.540
It just makes sense.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.390
And so over the coming months,
we're going to roll out more

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.210
experiments.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.720
And, finally, to everybody,
personalization across

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.230
categorical searches.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.820
So I've thrown a lot of
things at you so far.

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.910
So just to step back
and summarize it.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:08.630
We've talked about the search
statistics, the feedback loops

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.400
that we look at in order to
improve our search and our

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.340
discovery systems.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.970
We talked about navigational
search suggestions.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.230
We talked about how our top
charts are generated across

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.550
each category , generated
daily and

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.810
across every country.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.790
We talked about what trending
apps are, what it means to be

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.750
in there, and how you
can get in there.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.700
We talked about how related
and cross sell works.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.360
And we also talked about how
we're starting to personalize

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.300
Play and how that's going to
roll out over the coming

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.540
months, and how that really
fulfills our vision of a

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.580
personalized Play
made personal.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.900
So I promised you, guys, I'll
leave you with five things

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.410
that you can do to improve your
discoverability on Play.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.130
So let's get right into it, but
before we do that, I want

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.360
to tell you it's just as
important to build a good app.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:55.520
To take the time to go through
those app developer guidelines

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.120
on developer.android.com and
make sure you have a good app.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.770
You can complement that by
optimizing on the store, but

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.120
at the end of the day, nothing
substitutes a very good

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.790
experience for your app.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.590
Two months ago we added
a list of guidelines.

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.470
The Tablet [? App ?]

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.570
Guidelines, what it means to
be designed for tablets.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.580
And I highly recommend that you
get this design for tablet

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.870
designation.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.840
Earlier at I/O we announced
the design for tablets top

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.330
lists on some of
our home pages.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.820
Over time this is going to roll
across the Store, so a

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:32.890
tablet user really gets the best
experience possible by

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.550
showing the apps and promoting
the apps that have gone

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.670
through the trouble of making
that experience better.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.150
So you're going to see this not
just on the top list, but

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.630
over time in search and
all of our other

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.350
discovery features as well.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.090
The developer console helps
you with optimization tips

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.790
that they've added, and then in
the next talk by [? Ali ?]

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.150
[? Mausen ?]

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.670
[? Ricardo ?] we'll go through
this in detail-- what you can

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.340
do to really get some of
these designations.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.540
So get the "Designed for
Tablet" designation

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.000
Number two, and this is a much
less known fact about the way

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.760
we do search ranking
at Google Play.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.860
Today most articles that are
published on the web about

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.140
Play apps have a link at the
end that says Google Play

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.180
Store, or play link.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.630
Actually over 99% of anchors
that we get into the Google

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.980
Play Store just have
those two phrases.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.400
And that doesn't
help us at all.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.155
We want to help you get
discovered even on Play.

00:30:26.155 --> 00:30:28.790
Sure, you tell us a little bit
about your app, but if a

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:31.260
trusted source on the right,
for example, TechCrunch, is

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.230
telling us what your
app is about.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.170
Even before you have any
installs, we can trust that

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.080
and start boosting you
for those terms.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.720
So next time you're talking to
a blog writer or someone

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.670
writing an article about your
app, have them give you some

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:47.120
link juice.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.550
Have them put something
interesting in those links

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.330
linking to your app

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:55.040
The third one is to avoid
common mistakes.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.850
I told you there were 6 million
and more unique

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.960
phrases that are searched
for every month.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.550
What I didn't tell you is over
half of them are misspelled.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:09.170
That's amazing that half the
people are mistyping queries,

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.290
but that's just how the query
stream is on mobile today.

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:14.850
So as Google what we have to do
is we have to aggressively

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:15.900
correct for it.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.100
We have to make sure we help
the user find what they're

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.470
looking for, even
if it's a typo.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.590
So the one thing you can learn
from this is don't name your

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:28.120
app something that is a cute but
a common misspelling of a

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.135
very popular app, because
chances are a user looking for

00:31:32.135 --> 00:31:34.040
your app will get autocorrected
into something

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.780
that you're not happy with.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.740
The second thing I already
talked about, using the

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.600
targeting expressions on the
developer console carefully,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.260
which countries and carriers
you're targeting depending on

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.430
your target audience.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:50.180
And the third one, again, is one
that is a little subtle,

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.520
but I think it's important.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.100
If you do have a developer URL
that is not a play.google.com

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.510
link or a code.google.com,
something that is

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.830
your home on the web.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.590
If it exists, do make sure
you upload that in

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.640
the developer console.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.200
Why?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.020
Well, we crawl the web, we
index the web for our web

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.060
search, and we use a lot
of those signals in

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.270
order to help you.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.110
If we know that you're the
kind of developer that is

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:18.390
about a specific subset of the
world, we will help you get

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.460
discovered when people are
looking for those terms on

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.000
Google Play.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.150
So again, if you have a
developer URL other than

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:28.670
something at google.com,
do upload that.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.580
Number four, is to make
your APK smaller.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.770
Users tend to install smaller
apps, a lot more than they do

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.740
larger apps.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:40.340
And they tend to uninstall
larger apps at a

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.040
higher rate as well.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.670
Let's think about why.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.120
As your phone runs
out of memory--

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.800
there's a finite amount
of memory--

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.640
users tend to go through the
list of apps they have, in

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.910
decreasing order of size, and
start uninstalling the apps

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.450
that they're using
least actively.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.056
So the further down that list
you are, the less likely you

00:32:59.056 --> 00:33:00.970
are to be uninstalled.

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:03.640
So make your APK size smaller.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.440
In the coming months we're going
to start looking deeper

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.530
into the APK from a search &amp;
discovery perspective as well.

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:11.480
We're going to look at the kind
of SDKs you're linking

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.580
with, the libraries you're
linking with to figure out

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.370
what is your app really about.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.460
Looking at the kind of sites
that your app is connecting

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.740
with by emulating it; and try
to really figure out what is

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.550
your app about, so we can help
users find apps that will help

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.680
them do what they're
looking to do.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.740
And the last one--

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.400
and this is something many of
you asked us for-- is to

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.370
create a second channel of

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.790
distribution, the viral channel.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.730
There hasn't been too much of a
viral channel, and I'm going

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.700
to go through a few things that
we're going to be pushing

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.810
over the coming months.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.390
The first one are highly
rated apps.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.980
These are apps that your
friends, your circles, and

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.380
others that you trust have rated
highly in our Store.

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.980
So here are some apps that
are rated highly for me.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.760
On the right you see at the
"Quora" app is rated highly by

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.680
my roommate David.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.090
He rated it five stars.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.280
Then "Logo Quiz." my friend
Ruthica said it's an extremely

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.930
fun game, it's so addicting,
she couldn't stop.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.239
That's the personal touch
that we can add to

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:10.480
the Google Play Store.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.389
Some of these apps have never
been on the homepage.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:16.830
This is the easiest way for each
of you to get on Google

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:17.940
Play's homepage.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.210
Have your users review
your apps.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.474
Their friends will start seeing
them on their Google

00:34:23.474 --> 00:34:25.929
Play homepage.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.280
I've talked a lot about
+1 already.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.940
+1 has been an integral part of
our system since we first

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.000
personalized recommendations
last year.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.639
The reason I bring it up again
is because there's an API,

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.750
which I'm not sure why many
of you are not using.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.850
This API is available on the
Google+ recommendations API

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.820
page and it enables you to allow
your users to +1 an app

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.060
from within your app.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.389
So you don't have to have a
message that says go to Google

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.870
Play and +1 my app.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.949
You don't need to have your
users leave your experience.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:58.310
Keep them in your app.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.010
We want to make it easier.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:02.465
So we already have in-app
billing for you guys, there's

00:35:02.465 --> 00:35:03.600
the in-app +1.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.890
And in coming months we're going
to also have in-app rate

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:06.320
and review.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.080
So again, we don't want your
users to leave your app.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:11.250
If we can do what they need to
do from within your app,

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.040
great, and we're going to help
you do that as well.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.210
And the last thing to create the
viral loop is to integrate

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.740
with Google Play
Games services.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.940
At first, what you are going to
get is when someone opens

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.730
your app, they can see which of
their friends are playing,

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.960
they can find opponents--
it makes your app more

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:27.500
interactive.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.970
You've got the multiplayer, you
have the leader boards--

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.650
it makes your app social.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.275
In the longer term though, this
along with the Google

00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:38.010
Plus Moments API, which allows
you to share specific piece of

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.760
information.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.220
I'm currently playing this game
or I'm at level 27 of

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.280
this game will allow us in the
Store to annotate and make

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
things more personal.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.380
How great would be if my
homepage said, right now

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:51.840
[? Shellaby ?]

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.180
is looking for an opponent for
"Riptide." That's the best way

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:57.510
to not only get someone to
install your app, but open it

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.380
right away.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.520
Get you those engaged users
that you're looking for.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.990
So that's how I recommend
integrating with the Google

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.000
Play Games services.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.570
Again, the five things that
you should do to get

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.630
discovered more in Play.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.100
Get the Designed for Tablets
designation.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.810
Start getting helpful web
anchors, avoid some of the

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:18.190
common mistakes about
misspellings, because we have

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.570
to auto correct for them,
and targeting

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.400
your audience correctly.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.490
Reduce the size of your APK, and
then really start closing

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.680
that viral loop.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.520
Help your users promote
you in addition to

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.420
depending on just the store.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.260
So we've talked a lot about
user acquisition.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.600
I've talked about the organic
growth that you can get from

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.160
the Search &amp; Discovery aspects
of the Google Play Store.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.940
We've talked about the viral
aspect of Search &amp; Discovery,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.420
and many of you already know
about the paid aspect, which

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.140
is important to some of your
businesses as well.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:54.520
I won't talk too much about
it, but what I will say is

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.570
that investing in paid user
acquisition can have a very

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.210
positive impact on organic
and viral growth as well.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:06.260
And so if you can, is it is
something to think about in

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.460
the bigger picture of things.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.820
Now user acquisition is just
the first step in creating

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.600
lifetime value for your users.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.350
As a business owner, I always
like to think about my key

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.340
metrics and have a very
good handle on them.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.100
And the one that I found in the
mobile space and in any

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.740
user-centric space is the
lifetime value of

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:26.990
every one of my users.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.140
We talked about user
acquisition, let me briefly

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.420
mention the other two.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.970
User retention I like to break
into two different ratios.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.040
The first is a short-term
user retention ratio.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.270
This is how do I initially
keep my users?

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:44.910
Most of the time this happens
because the users like what

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.280
you're promising them.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.030
They install your app,
they open it.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.290
The long-term user retention
ratio, which is very much like

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.030
the long install metric that I
talked about, is the on-going

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.420
mechanics of your app.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.590
Or what you develop, you
delivering on your promise.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.050
So in the example of "Scramble
With Friends," initially they

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:06.070
got a lot of their users because
it was very much like

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.030
the word games when
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.950
grew up with, but over time
their social, their

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.300
interactive features and what
kept them growing and made it

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.380
successful.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.210
User monetization I look at
in terms of two different

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:19.920
lenses-- the big picture is the
revenue for install, and

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.650
that makes sense-- it's a very
good macro metric, and its

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.575
comparable to your user
acquisition costs, your cost

00:38:25.575 --> 00:38:27.130
per install as well.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:27.920
So you can do that.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.340
But the real picture is the
revenue per active user,

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.450
that's what you have most
control over-- the people that

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.750
are in your system, in your
game, in your app, and how can

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.440
you tune it to make
the most money.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.750
So as you think about your
users, try and to break it

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.430
down into the key metrics
and have a very

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.010
good handle on them.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:48.050
So I hope that this talk is held
to get a good idea of how

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.460
we build some of our Search
&amp; Discovery systems.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.480
My goal was to really start
this conversation.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.120
I want to continue it.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.690
And none of this would have been
possible without my team

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.860
on Google Play.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.110
So this is my shout
out to them.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.340
Thank you for doing all the
great stuff that you've done .

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.780
And for all of you, thank you
for being here so early.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.540
I would like to continue
this conversation.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.900
I'll be at office hours right
after this, so if you have any

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.100
questions, please come there.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.020
Or you can reach out to me
on Google+ or Twitter.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.670
And I'm happy to
continue this.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.410
Thank you very much.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:22.677
[APPLAUSE]
