ERIK KAY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.840
Welcome to the session, Chrome
Apps State of The Nation.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.990
My name is Erik Kay.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.290
I'm an engineering director at
Google, and just a quick

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.730
reminder upfront, before
we dive in.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.890
We're really interested in
getting your feedback on how

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.320
each of these talks are going.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.330
You can use either the I/O app
to rate the session and give

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.430
us feedback, or use
the QR code in the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.920
back to do a rating.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.250
So first off, what is
this talk all about?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.970
It's about Chrome
packaged apps.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.570
This is the way to build native
quality applications

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.310
using the Chrome runtime.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.680
Let's see.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.060
So, how many of you were here
at last year's talk, when we

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.982
first gave a preview for
what Chrome packaged

00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:55.230
apps were all about?

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.870
All right, good.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.370
Thanks for coming back.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.680
For the rest of you, let me give
you a little bit of an

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.960
overview of what Chrome
packaged apps are.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320
So the idea here is that people
want to be able to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.120
build native quality desktop
applications using web

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.920
technology.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.080
Using web technology.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.700
HTML, JavaScript, CSS.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.950
They would like, though, at the
same time, to not give up

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.040
all the capabilities
they're used to.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.020
Access to the hardware, access
to the operating system.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.500
They'd like to look and act,
behave as peers for the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.900
desktop counterparts.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.690
And so that's what we've built
with Chrome packaged apps.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.320
And I'm going to talk in a lot
more detail about what each of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.000
these aspects are, but
that's sort of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.920
the idea in a nutshell.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.540
Now last year, as I said, we
gave a sneak peek of where we

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.290
were at with packaged apps.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.540
Showed you how these apps were
immersive, how they ran

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.930
outside of the browser, and
allowed for customizable UI.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.150
Full control over
all the windows.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.220
How they interacted with the
hardware and operating system

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.800
capabilities, and how they were

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.770
offline enabled by default.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.182
So after that, we put it
available behind a flag over

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:10.280
the summer.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.650
We started shipping a few
default packaged apps in

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.975
Chrome OS this fall.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:16.580
We had a few hackathons,
I hope a few of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.860
you made it to that.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.040
If not, there's more
hackathons coming.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.470
Keep an eye out for those
in your local area.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.440
We had a developer preview
turned on in February, so you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.910
could start uploading your
packaged apps to the store.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.380
And just the other week, we
enabled our consumer preview,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.670
which means anyone at the dev
channel can now go to the web

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.942
store and see all the packaged
apps that have

00:02:38.942 --> 00:02:40.070
been uploaded there.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.340
And in our next release, Chrome
29, we're looking to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.260
have a full consumer launch.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.680
So let me dive in a bit about
each of the properties that we

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.490
have for Chrome packaged apps.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.320
So first off, I said
they're inverses.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.650
So what does that
mean, exactly?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.050
Well, it could mean a couple
of different things.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.780
For example, it could
mean something like

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.365
this YouTube app.

00:03:02.365 --> 00:03:06.500
Now, this is the full experience
that you see maybe

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.680
on your TV, or on
the PlayStation.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.200
But all custom UI full
screen immersive, so

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.850
nothing in the way.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.930
But immersive just have
to mean that.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.430
Doesn't have to mean
full screen.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.690
It might mean that it's just
part of the operating system.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.650
It's taking advantage of
different features of the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.830
operating system.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.150
So for example, this
presentation that I've got

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.610
going up here is actually
is actually an app.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.330
It's a packaged app, and I've
got it, no title bar, I've got

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.150
it glued to the side
of the screen.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.385
I've got it, no UI widgets, just
full edge to edge control

00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:42.630
under my [? power. ?]

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.140
And further, I even have it
integrating with the OS in an

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.030
interesting way.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.420
I put up a rich notification
here showing how I'm doing

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.860
this presentation on a Pixel.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.890
I hope you all enjoy that, and
can play with some of these

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.990
things like I am here.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.890
The rich notifications that you
can deliver there are a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.400
relatively recent API that we
rolled out, that mirror the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.690
kind of things, notifications
that you're used

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.910
to doing with Android.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.190
In fact, we're trying to make
them parallel in most ways.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.500
So these apps are
very capable.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.029
And what I mean by capable is
that they can have access to

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.240
the underlying operating
system primitives.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.690
They can do things like
access TCP/IP sockets.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.300
They can access your hardware.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.775
So for example, let me just
pull up a couple here.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.210
Here's one that's built into
Chrome OS, and it's like a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.840
simple camera app that's
talking to your webcam.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.500
Notice it just looks and acts
like a native application,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.650
does everything you'd expect.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.340
Here's one that maybe the techie
crowd would appreciate

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.440
here, is as developers, this
is an IRC app, a chatroom

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.400
application where developers
hang out.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.830
This is the Blink chat room
where the Blink developers all

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.185
hang out and talk about
the things that

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.170
are going on there.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.470
In order to implement this, you
have to use raw socket,

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.950
TCP/IP to talk to it again.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.120
This just looks like a
standalone native desktop app.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.416
That's because the runtime
enables that.

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:18.040
I've got another application
here that I can't give you the

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.750
full demo of, because I left
a memory card away.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:29.960
But this is the G+ photos
application that basically

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.690
allows you to automatically
upload photos that when you

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.990
plug in a memory card or attach
your camera, if you

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.250
just attach it, you
can curate it.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.510
This is part of the overall
G+ photos experience.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.960
So, offline.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
So Chrome packaged apps are
offline enabled by default.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.130
So what do I mean by offline?

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.250
First let's define terms.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.830
On one end, offline can mean
I have no network of all.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.760
I'm not connected
to the internet.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.290
I'm on an airplane, I'm in
the desert, whatever.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.520
But really, the more common
case is I've got

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.900
a really bad network.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.450
It's unreliable, it's
slow, it's flaky.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.830
I think a few of you are
experiencing that right now.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.940
Maybe even the servers
are down.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.490
Maybe the internet, your net
connection is fine, but the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.930
particular server you're talking
to is timing out, or

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.900
having some trouble.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.530
Native apps don't really have
a huge problem with this,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.510
because all their code is
already down on the client and

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:27.540
already running.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.660
So if they can't talk to their
server, all it means is they

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.060
couldn't get some
of their data.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.740
They can recover.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.920
They can detect that.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.440
The web has had some weaknesses
on this front,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.250
where because we mix code and
data together in HTML, it

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.970
means that if you have a network
outage as code is

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.970
coming down, well, you have half
your page there, and your

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.260
page isn't functional.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.170
And that's why we have reload
buttons in browsers because,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.310
how many times do you
hit Reload a day?

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.540
Invariably there are errors.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.050
You have to hit refresh, or
hit back to fix that.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.310
But your desktop app doesn't
have a Reload button, so we

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.620
need to make these apps work
offline by default.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.980
And the way we do that is by
having the code down on the

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.330
device ahead of time, so that
it's always there, always

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.180
ready to go, and enforcing
the separation

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.170
between code and data.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.770
Let me give you a quick
example of this.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.740
So here's an app called "Google
Keep." Maybe a few of

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.310
you have already
tried this out.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.540
Really nicely done packaged app,
and what you can see here

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.620
is that it's basically
just a panel.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.750
So again, it's immersive.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.570
It's sort of a nice size.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.160
You can put it off
to the side here.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.690
It's just in this case,
I've just got a

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.040
simple to do item here.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.260
You can have other
notes and photos.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.510
But what I'm going to do is I'm
going to play with fire

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.880
here, and I'm going to tempt the
demo gods, and I'm going

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.140
to unplug the network.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.570
OK, what happens?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.470
So what you'll see here is
that it'll say that--

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:55.000
well, actually I need to turn
off the wi-fi, too, which is

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.850
actually working, which
shouldn't be.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.010
Let's turn off the wi-fi.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.860
OK.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.490
So now you see that the
display changed.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.610
It immediately detected that.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.460
It says all notes are now saved
offline, and so what I

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.450
can do here is I can still, even
though it's offline, I

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.460
can mark something done,
I can delete an item.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.830
I can add another item,
and it's offline.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.010
And in fact, if I just then
reconnect this up, it'll

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:27.190
detect that, wake up again in a
second, and it says saving,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.980
and it's all back in the
cloud automatically.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.980
There's no errors, and all of
this really comes for free as

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.490
part of the package.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.110
When you write a Chrome
packaged app,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.330
it's offline by default.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.440
It's also cloud enabled
by default.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.570
So it's all fine and good to be
offline, but then you start

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.553
to lose some of the advantages
that you have on the web.

00:08:49.553 --> 00:08:53.060
The web is cloud enabled by
default, but not offline

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.590
enabled by default.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.630
Native apps tend to be offline
enabled by default, but not

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.890
cloud enabled by default.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.650
We're trying to have a bit of
both, and the way we do that

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.890
is by providing a number of
useful APIs out of the box.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.920
One of them is one that we
introduced last year, called

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.520
"Chrome Storage Sync." And what
that does is provide a

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.770
way to have simple key value
pairs stored reliably,

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.060
synchronized to your account.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.040
No matter what machine you're
on, it they follow you around,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.440
come with you.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.230
And that's really useful for
things like settings,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.020
configuration, state.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.900
So imagine you set up your app
on one machine, you go to

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.380
another machine, now it's
all set up, ready to go.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.690
Or that you're playing a game
and you're on level three, and

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.840
then you go to another machine,
and that one is on

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.180
level three now, too.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.170
It's really useful for that
sort of simple state data.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.520
But what if you need to
deal with larger data?

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.500
Well, recently we just announced
another API called

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.890
Chrome Sync file system, and the
sync file system API uses

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.160
your Drive account to store
documents, to store photos and

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.000
media files, and that
sort of thing.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.330
It's really good at these large
chunk document types.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.190
And again, automatically
works.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.180
All you do is use the HTML5 file
system API, create your

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.790
files, save them into there,
and you as a developer, for

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.470
both of these API, you didn't
have to set up any cloud

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.410
infrastructure on your own.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.670
You didn't have to set
up your own servers.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.770
You didn't have to deal with
scalability concerns if your

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.270
app was a runaway success.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.500
Because all the data is stored
in the user's account, not

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.320
your account, not
on your server.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.260
So you don't have to worry
about all of that.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.190
Now, there's a third type of
data that the observant among

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.410
you will notice I didn't talk
about, which is database or

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.670
transactional data.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.610
And that's where you're getting
the more advanced use

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.000
cases, where it's really hard
to have a generic API that

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.060
addresses everybody's
concerns.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.700
So you tend to have to write
most of that logic yourself.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.900
However, we help you out
a bit there, too.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.350
Just last week we announced
Google Cloud, we announced a--

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.310
sorry, a push messaging API,
which is sort of the mirror to

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.840
Google Cloud Messaging from
Android, again, in Chrome.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.840
And allows you to push data
down to your device

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.480
automatically.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.310
And the nice thing about this
is the reason why this helps

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.820
in that synchronization, that
database transactional

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.380
synchronization model is it
means that, again, your app

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.460
doesn't need to--

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.160
your app can always stay up
to sync in the background.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.410
Because what could happen is
your server can say, OK,

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.020
something new happened.

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.860
A message gets sent into the
push messaging, and the Chrome

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.710
runtime will receive that
message, wake up your app, let

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.800
it run code, let it download
what it needs to do, and

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.240
again, you can handle the

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.700
synchronization logic yourself.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.820
Now, I mentioned earlier
that we're using this

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:49.230
heavily for Chrome OS.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.430
It's more than just as a
platform for third parties.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.420
We use it ourselves for all
of the built in apps.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.110
The camera app I showed you
earlier, that's a packaged app

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.730
that's built into Chrome OS.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.140
Even the file manager that we
use to look at images and

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.890
videos, yep, that's a lovely
picture, and movies, inline,

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.380
all of that is done
as a packaged app.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.410
Calculator, that's
all there, too.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.650
All the little utilities and
things that make an OS an OS

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.430
are part of that.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.100
Chrome packaged apps are also
cross platform by default.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.130
Since you're building it with
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.070
it's built on top of the Chrome
runtime, your apps run

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.150
everywhere that the Chrome
runtime runs.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.900
So for example, let's say that
you're 500 pixels, and you

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.650
wanted to write a desktop app
version of your website.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.890
So you build the packaged app,
photos all sync offline.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.890
You can browse them,
view them.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.510
I'm using touch here to control

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.230
this and scroll around.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.180
But this app that runs and
works exactly the same on

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.360
Windows, on Mac, on Chrome
OS, on Linux.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.210
And when I say cross platform,
I also mean mobile.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.320
And this is something we've
been working on since last

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.450
year, but probably many of
you haven't seen it yet.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.500
Let me give you a sneak preview
of what it means to

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.480
run a Chrome packaged app
on my Android device.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:25.580
Here's that same 500 pixels app
doing exactly what you'd

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.230
expect it to do.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.040
Basically the same code, very
little needed to be modified

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.560
in order to bring that over.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.240
So, how does that work?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.750
Well, what we did is we started
contributing a year

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.770
ago to the Cordova project.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.260
You may know it by
its commercial

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.800
name, which is PhoneGap.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.410
Cordova, what it does is it
wraps up the native web view

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:53.490
on a platform around an
executable, and then runs the

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:57.290
HTML, JavaScript, CSS in
that local context.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.990
It also allows you to have
native API bindings to it, and

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.330
what we've been contributing in
addition to contributing to

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.070
the overall quality of Cordova,
performance and

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.540
features, and modularity, and
that sort of thing, we've

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.650
contributed some modules that
provide a compatibility layer

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.150
for Chrome packaged apps.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.900
So basically, you can build your
Chrome packaged app and

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.340
now target Cordova, and run your
same app with the same

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.745
APIs on iOS, on Android, and
other Cordova projects.

00:14:26.384 --> 00:14:29.216
Thank you.

00:14:29.216 --> 00:14:33.190
Thought a few of you
might like that.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.070
So, speaking of development,
let's just talk about

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.410
development and what
that means.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.930
Because it's HTML, JavaScript,
CSS, you get access to all the

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:46.190
same great developer tools
that you've been seeing

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.520
everybody use in all the
talks around here.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.750
And again, you've probably heard
this before, but if you

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.230
haven't checked out the Chrome
Developer Tools in a while,

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.740
you should.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.280
They're changing at
such a rapid rate.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.120
They're improving, and they're
pretty amazing and powerful.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.180
So for example, here I can look
at the full details of my

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.900
app, this presentation app,
inspect all the elements.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:13.610
I can turn off, toggle
things, edit things.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.690
In fact, I noticed something
embarrassing here.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.910
Somebody pointed this out to
me, that maybe three gears

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.970
intermeshed together isn't
actually the best example of

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.850
productivity.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:29.195
So let me just fix that here,
and I'll just move that off to

00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:30.430
the side there.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.570
So I think that's a better
looking thing.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.425
Now, not only that, but again,
because it's web stuff, let me

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.850
just run another packed app
here, which is a simple code

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.470
editor that we've got up in
our GitHub repository.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.940
A text editor that has full
syntax highlighting, and

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.340
everything you'd expect there.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.470
And I'm going to find this slide
here that I'm looking at

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.890
right now, and you could see
that it's very simple.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.260
It just has this
one text here.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.190
But I'm going to make just
another little change.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:00.910
Standard stuff.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:06.910
And because this is
an app, just edit,

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.230
reload, and away we go.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.300
So that's great.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.760
You can build it, it works just
like you'd expect with

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.930
web technology.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.750
Now you want to get that
app out there.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.530
For those of you who have been
playing around with apps or

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.810
extensions, you know that the
way to do that is through the

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:24.980
Chrome Web Store.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.470
Chrome Web Store is really
easy to get going.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.110
What you do is you just package
all your files up, all

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.630
your source code up
in a zip file.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.730
You upload it, you add a few
assets so it could show up in

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.395
the store properly.

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:38.610
You hit publish.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.980
An hour later it's live, and
your users can start using it,

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.480
installing it, and whatever.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.070
We've also been working on
a number of improvements.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.520
Since last year, a number of you
may have noticed that we

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.670
made some pretty significant
changes to the

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.650
layout of the web store.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.940
And these have been mostly
aimed at end users.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.680
At things like discoverability,
and things

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.490
that keep users coming back,
to come looking for more.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.150
And it's succeeded on that front
pretty significantly.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.109
So we now have much higher
install rates and return rates

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.609
for users coming back,
and we think that's

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:14.359
a big win for you.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.010
But we're not done there.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.180
What you're seeing here on this
slide is just a sneak

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.300
preview of a more structured
layout, where we're going to,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.339
rather than just having this
long, continuous wall, we're

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:26.920
going to have things grouped up
into some sections, so that

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.910
people can sort of see the
source where these things are

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:30.640
coming from.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.570
And again, hopefully give them
more ways to explore

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.530
and find new items.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.180
We're also spending a lot of
time working on your developer

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.830
pain points.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:43.790
The things that you've told us
are making your life harder to

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.230
do within the web store.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.160
So for example, one of the main
things we've heard is

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.580
that it's kind of a pain to
administer these things when

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.170
you're within your company.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.860
And so we're adding group
administrative features.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.970
So that means that you can
have a Google group, have

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.510
different members of that group,
and then they all can

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.840
access different aspects of the
management to the apps.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.120
You can have your marketing
person access it, edit the

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.230
copy, your developer
uploads the code.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.920
Your business person looks at
the numbers, and you don't

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.350
have to worry about who comes
and goes from your company and

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.330
how to manage that.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.070
It's very simple.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.330
We're also working on things
like incremental rollout, so

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.790
that you can do experiments.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.610
If you've got a large number of
users, maybe you don't want

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:30.250
to have a new update go out
to all of your users

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.300
all at the same time.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.790
So you can do a percent rollout,
see what the feedback

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:37.020
looks like from your early
users, and then scale it back

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:39.250
if there's a problem
that you discover.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:41.050
And finally, for the native
client developers in the

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.580
crowd, we're also working on
making it so that the download

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.360
size for end users is smaller,
so they only download the

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.050
chunk of the CRX that they need
in order to run their

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.600
native client application.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.650
So that should be a dramatic
improvement in download speed

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.600
and how long it takes them
to get up and running.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.230
So, OK.

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.850
You can get it published.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.500
Now you'd like to actually
make money.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.340
I'm pretty sure that most of you
are here because you would

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.670
like your apps to be able
to make money, right?

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.630
And maybe there's some
hobbyists, but really, we want

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.140
to figure out how to
make this work.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.260
And aside from upfront purchase,
which we've had in

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.230
the web store from the
beginning, we're also adding

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.040
in app purchase now.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.590
And I'll give you just
a preview of

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:24.240
what this looks like.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.930
Here I've got kind of a
contrived, I want to make it

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.840
buy a gold star here, so
I hover over this.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.200
When I click on it, it just pops
up some Google Wallet UI.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.730
If I wasn't signed in, it would
walk me through the sign

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.480
in process.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.590
Again, you as a developer don't
need to write any of

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.550
this code, but if somebody is
already signed up, they just

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.630
click the Buy button, and it
takes a second or two.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.020
And I'm going against
the debug server, so

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.070
it's a little slower.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.160
But now it's done, and boom,
I've got a gold star.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:58.290
And if it hadn't done it, it
would have given me a failure

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.330
message there.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.570
Really simple to use.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.020
Just drop in a little line of
JavaScript, and away you go.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.190
We're really interested in
talking to you about some

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:10.270
other things on the monetization
front.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.250
We've got a number of other
projects underway that we're

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.440
not ready to talk about quite
yet, but this is an area that

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.600
we're really going
to be focusing on

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.830
over the next 12 months.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.410
So basically, Chrome packaged
apps are immersive, they've

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.150
got rich OS capabilities, they
are offline by default, and

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.790
cloud enabled by default
together.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.300
And that's an important
combination.

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.810
They are cross platform.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.850
You write your app
basically once.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.410
It'll run across these
different platforms.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.290
You'll be able to share a large
amount of the code as

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.040
you go, even to mobile.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.210
And you get all the
great development

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.110
tools you're used to.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:47.800
And my slide is a little
crunched here, but

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:53.080
distribution and monetization
come into play there as well.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.650
So I'd like to walk you
through, now, a few

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.890
concrete use cases.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.760
So we've just talked about what
Chrome packaged apps are,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.680
but now who should use them?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.240
Why would you use this over
some other native desktop

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.550
technology?

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.350
Well, one example
is Chrome OS.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.780
And as you heard in the keynote,
Chrome OS continues

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.860
to grow rapidly.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.270
We're still early days, but the
fact that we've been one

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:20.160
of the top sellers, top laptop
items in Amazon, we're doing

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.830
extremely well and expanding our
reach in retail and Best

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.780
Buy, and in international
circles, as you've seen

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.530
announcements that we're
expanding the number of

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.670
countries we cover.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.280
Now is a great time that
you can step in and

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.700
sort of be the app.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.910
If you go out into the Chrome
sandbox, for example, you can

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.320
see a video editing
application.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.470
This is something people sort
of said, well, you can't

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.020
really do that on Chrome OS.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.010
Well, yes you can.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:47.250
With Chrome packaged apps, you
can do an offline capable,

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.910
full video editor.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:56.380
Or maybe you've got an idea for
some diagramming software.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.250
Well, you can be the first one
out there who builds that

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.430
diagramming software, and like
[? Gliffy ?] is, and again

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.110
they're out in the sandbox,
and now own that space.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.780
You become the diagramming
software for Chrome OS by

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.030
doing that.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.260
Now, I mentioned cross
platform before.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.570
This is an important use case as
well, but I want to expound

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:28.780
on it a little bit, because the
main thing that is changed

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.450
over the last 10, 15 years in
this is it used to be that you

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.500
really only had to writ e
for one platform before.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.415
You just had to write
for Windows.

00:22:37.415 --> 00:22:41.700
But nowadays you have to write
for Windows, for Mac, for the

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.660
web, for two, three, four
mobile platforms, maybe.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.550
And maybe even another
version of Windows.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.010
Windows 8, you might need
a different version

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.930
of your app, right?

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:54.050
And each of these different
platforms that you're

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.380
targeting has a cost to it.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.570
They're different
technologies.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.540
You often have to have different
developer teams,

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.010
different areas of expertise.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.450
Maybe you can't share
the code.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:04.500
Maybe you can't keep
the apps in sync.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.070
All of that is a cost, and
there's also hidden costs that

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:09.450
developers often forget
about upfront.

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.300
There's things like installers,
and auto updaters.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.170
All the sort of guts that sort
of keep your app working and

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.000
get it out to your users, and
help make it all work.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.150
Those are things that
we take care of.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.020
You don't have to write an
installer ever again.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:27.290
You don't have to write an
auto-updater ever again.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.290
So another interesting use
case is device apps.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:36.310
Now, what I mean by this is
these days, there's a lot of

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.430
interesting gadgets out there.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.650
There's fitness equipment,
there's GPS connected watches,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:46.640
there's things that are used
to sync music to my car.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.200
Basically, there's this
rebirth, resurgence in

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.700
consumer electronics because
these devices are all now

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.070
getting internet connected.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.050
Syncing data with my computer.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.670
And what that means is that each
of these devices needs to

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.340
be able to actually talk to
my computer in some way.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.740
They need to have some bit of
software that runs on the app.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.590
And if you're one of the
developers that's writing one

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.600
of these things, you
now have a problem.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.990
And again, it's this cross
platform problem, because you

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.350
have to go where
your users are.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.950
So you have to write an app,
write maybe even a device

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:16.800
driver for each of these
different platforms.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.780
What we provide is some APIs out
of the box that will allow

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.740
you to do USB, Bluetooth
in a cross platform way

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.080
from user land code.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.280
And let me just show you a
really simple example of this.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.760
This is a little thermal label
printer that you probably saw

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.100
a few of the people
downstairs using.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.740
But this is something where I'm
connecting this up to a

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.970
Chrome OS device.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:50.360
Now, this OS doesn't have a
device driver for this guy.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.950
I didn't know about it at all
in advance, but we have a

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.390
little sample app that we wrote
here that is written

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.290
specifically for this.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:04.740
And I'll just do this, and let
me also just, again, integrate

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:09.420
with the webcam, take a picture,
and I say print, and

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.430
the printer starts going
and talking.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:14.430
And this was something that one
of our developers banged

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:19.070
out in an afternoon in one
of our hackathons.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.920
So, anyway you can't really
see it very well there.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.230
But again, all of that was done
without the OS having to

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.880
know about things in advance
installed from user [? land ?]

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.030
code.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.310
Really easy.

00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:36.110
Another interesting use case, if
you're a developer, you've

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.640
had to write a kiosk.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.730
An application that needs be
full screen, locked down,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.520
single purpose.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.620
Think ATMs or airport ticket
buying things,

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.900
or reservation shores.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.470
Or even at the front desk
here when you were

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.590
registering this morning.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.190
This is a kiosk application,
and traditionally, kiosk

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:03.810
applications have been written
on old versions of Windows XP.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.610
There's like, an industry there,
and you've probably all

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.400
laughed and seen the blue
screens of death on various

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.860
terminals around as
you've walked.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.880
And I assure you, for the
developers who write that,

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.640
that's not funny.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.270
It turns out that not only is
stability of the platform a

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.640
problem, but also
administration, pushing

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.510
updates is a big problem
for these things.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.880
And I'm happy to announce that
today, we're rolling out kiosk

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.120
app functionality
in Chrome OS.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.520
This means that you can use our
enterprise policies, our

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.770
dashboard to automatically push
out and deploy a kiosk

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:44.010
application to a Chrome OS
device and have it boot up and

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.990
be in that mode.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.180
And because it's Chrome OS,
it will auto update

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:49.800
automatically.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.510
Your app will auto update
automatically.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.220
It's all written in HTML
and JavaScript.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.280
It's much easier to build
the debug test.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.790
And in fact, as I've mentioned,
the kiosk app that

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.240
we're using downstairs is
using this technology.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.890
It's worked pretty well.

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.450
I'll show you another one that
one of our partners out in the

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.890
sandbox is using.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.510
This is from Pearson.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.850
They do test taking.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:18.810
So this is a student test, so
aiming at like, high school

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.000
students or something.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.855
But they basically want to take
students in, put them in

00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:25.000
front of a computer, have it be
locked down, just take the

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.950
test, get the result, and have
things go, and it starts

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.610
asking questions and all that.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.180
So right now because I'm running
this sort of already

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.800
logged in, it's not really
fully in kiosk mode, but

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.860
you'll have to take my word for
it about what that would

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.630
look like, and that the user
wouldn't be able to

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.280
pop out like this.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.580
OK.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.100
Games.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.730
Now, games is another
important use case.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.720
We've spent a fair amount
of time looking at--

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.990
this one takes a little while
to start up, so I'll talk a

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.150
little bit over it.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.320
So this is built using native
client technology.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.930
With native client allows you
to do is use native code and

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.260
bring it to the web platform
basically with the same level

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.950
of security as JavaScript, but
the similar performance to

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:08.870
native code.

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.380
And this one's built using
the Unity engine.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:16.950
It's a cute little game that's
in the web store now.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.480
This is a little demo
here, which I

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.290
apparently have reset recently.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:24.410
So anyway, you hop around
and you've got

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:25.440
multiple clones of yourself.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.060
It's very cute.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.300
I recommend trying it out, here
I can't really demo it

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.970
all the way, but you
could see it had a

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.320
few interesting features.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:37.040
It could be full screen, you can
add things like mouse lock

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.390
for first person shooters,
or that sort of thing.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:40.980
Integrate with the gamepad.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:46.320
Again, do what you need to do
this as a game developer.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.730
Another interesting use case,
again, something you can go

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.090
out and see first hand in the
Chrome sandbox on the third

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:58.240
floor is this idea of saying,
I've got a website, and I want

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.580
to make that website
even better.

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:07.720
And it looks like I need
to log in here.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.970
Uh-oh.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.750
Best laid plans here.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.690
Well, you'll have to go check
it out, the sandbox.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:22.790
The idea here is that basically,
take a website and

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.880
give it extra powers.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.890
In this case, they made it
something that was offline,

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.330
that could sync in the
background, issues down, and

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.380
so that no matter where you
are, whether you have a

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.495
network or not, you always have
the latest content, and

00:29:33.495 --> 00:29:34.950
it's always on your device
ready to go.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:36.780
And it's a full screen,
immersive experience that you

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.920
can bookmark and share, and that
it remembers where you

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.720
were, and picks up where you
left off when you go from

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.600
machine to machine.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.670
So, a bunch of interesting
use cases.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.960
These are where we've been
getting a lot of the most

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.540
interest, but we think there's
more out there.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.870
These are just a few of
the key examples.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.430
So let me talk a little bit
about where we're going.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.250
So I mentioned we're in consumer
preview now for

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.650
Windows and Chrome OS.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.660
That's in Chrome 28.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.690
If you're on the dev channel,
you can go to the web store,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.760
download, play with some of the
apps that these developers

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.250
have been making.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.176
We're going to do our full
consumer launch to Windows and

00:30:16.176 --> 00:30:17.920
Chrome OS users in Chrome 29.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.350
That's later this summer.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.620
Mac and Linux support
will be coming soon.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.030
Right now you can run it and
test it, but we don't have the

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.240
full OS integration for Mac
and Linux done quite yet.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.420
That'll probably be in the
29 timeframe as well.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.010
We're continuing to
work really hard

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.210
on Android and iOS.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.610
It's pretty early on, even
though the demo I showed you

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:42.240
looked pretty good, we're not
quite at the stage where we

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.080
think every developer should go
rushing and give it a try.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.310
But we're going to start
reaching out to early testers

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.300
soon, and we'll be talking at
the Cordova conference in

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.630
July, and we think we'll be
ready for wider use around

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.210
that timeframe.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.290
So, another interesting use
case I didn't talk about,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.080
because it's something we're
still working on and looking

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.320
to do is we want to make it
possible for people to build

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.920
developer tools on
this platform.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.490
And you saw a few examples.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.730
Yes, I want it, too.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.560
So one of the big things we've
heard from Chrome OS users is

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.630
that they love the machines, but
they would love to be able

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.970
to do self hosted development
just on this machine.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.120
As developers, we want to be
able to use the computers for

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.120
everything, right?

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.580
And because of the model we've
got where apps tend to be

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.180
sandboxed themselves, that means
that we have to figure

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.350
out how to make the apps be able
to share and communicate

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.850
with each other, as developer
tools often need to do.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.200
So we're working on some
experimental new APIs.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.990
You can look in our GitHub
repository for a sample app

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.110
that we're building that's sort
of an IDE for Chrome OS.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.980
Monetization, I mentioned this
before, we've got a lot of

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.100
ideas on new things we're
going to do on the

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.470
monetization front.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.210
New APIs.

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:59.390
These are both areas where you
could get involved with the

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:03.090
community and give us your
feedback about what you think

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.200
are our highest priorities
for you, the things

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.990
that you most need.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.710
And of course, we're going to
continue to work on those core

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.140
concepts that Linus mentioned
in the keynote.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.650
Speed, simplicity, security.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.320
Polishing the platform, making
it faster, making it more

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.900
reliable and more secure.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.020
So, thanks everybody
for coming.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.590
I just want to give you a few
more pointers to information

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.030
where you can learn more.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.530
We have a number of talks going
on about packaged apps.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.630
Joe Marini is doing a talk on
Thursday, I believe, about how

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.870
to convert your app,
your website into a

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.880
Chrome packaged app.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.550
We're doing a code lab
that [? Renato ?]

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.750
over here is going to actually
allow you to create a packaged

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:45.460
app from start to finish.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.400
The guys behind the G+ photos
app that just gave you a brief

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.560
demo of are going to give you a
walk through of what it took

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.210
them to build a large, full
scale, grown packaged app with

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.230
real database synchronization
the cloud.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.420
And you can always find
us up in the sandbox.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.500
There's a bunch of app
developers up there that have

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.200
built cool things with this
technology already, and you

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.670
can learn from them about what
they like, and what they don't

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.950
like so far.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.010
Of course, our documentation,
you can find us on G+.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.360
We've got a great community
there, and Stack Overflow,

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.640
we're there answering
questions.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.760
We've got a mailing list, and
even the developers are

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.420
hanging out on our IRC channel,
if you want to come

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.410
talk to devs directly.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.968
So, thanks much, and I'll
take questions now.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.010
Thanks.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.260
MALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.660
This sounds really cool for
developers, but I was

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.380
wondering if you could talk a
little bit about the user

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:47.970
experience.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.625
You mentioned Google Wallet and
Google Drive account, and

00:33:50.625 --> 00:33:51.480
a Google account.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.330
And all those things, and I
know that, for example in

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.320
Germany, there's a lot of people
who are reluctant to

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.540
giving all of their
data to Google.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.440
And I was just wondering, how
many things do I need to

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.490
install as a user?

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.920
How many things do I need to
sign up for, and how many

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.780
accounts do I need to merge into
one, and how much data am

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.060
I giving to Google and sharing
everywhere to be able to use

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.870
these apps?

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.080
ERIK KAY: So I mean, it
depends on the apps.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.469
The apps don't have to be tied
to Google in particular, but

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.040
some will be, just like
some apps are

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.360
tied to other platforms.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.850
So it's up to the developer
about what they want to do.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.610
We do require that you have a
Google account to sign in, so

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:31.070
that we can take advantage of
some of the functionality with

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.460
sync and sync file system,
and that sort of thing.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:37.520
So that we don't force you to
go through that sort of

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.020
process within each app,
we try to handle

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.270
it a central way.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.090
But really, it's up to the app
about how much they want to do

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.570
on that front.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.400
MALE SPEAKER: How about
the installation

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.449
process for the software?

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.520
ERIK KAY: Right, so
the installation--

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.980
so at that point, the only
thing you need to do is--

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.159
we handle that for you.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:58.510
If you've got Chrome, it'll just
install automatically.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.030
We're also working on ways to
have it, so even from other

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.990
browsers, you will just
install these

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.840
apps with one step.

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.090
MALE SPEAKER: OK, thanks.

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:08.490
MALE SPEAKER: We're currently
using packaged apps with

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.070
WebRTC on like, Mac OS.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.650
And it works great, so when you
port it over to Android or

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.730
to iOS, is WebRTC going
to follow with you?

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.100
And then also, if you just
talked about the messaging

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.610
components as well, so when you
take it into Android, does

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.980
it change the Chrome messaging
into Android Cloud Messaging,

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.640
and how does that all work?

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.360
ERIK KAY: Sure.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.940
So those are all great
questions.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.440
As I mentioned, we're
pretty early on

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.840
with the Cordova stuff.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.940
But it's important for people
to know there are a few

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.930
limitations of Cordova stuff.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.860
One is that we're dependent on
the web view on the platform

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.330
that we're on with this.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.960
So if the platform doesn't,
like iOS currently doesn't

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.010
have WebRTC, it'll mean
that we won't

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.640
have it WebRTCed there.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.850
Now, we're going to try to have
polyfills when possible

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.370
on some of the features,
but some of them are

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:54.880
so in depth to the--

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.560
MALE SPEAKER: Because Android
has WebRTC now.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:57.400
ERIK KAY: What's that?

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.570
MALE SPEAKER: Android
has WebRTC now.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.300
ERIK KAY: Yeah, so Android has
WebRTC now, so you would have

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.915
access to it there, but iOS
doesn't, for example.

00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:10.100
But for the Chrome APIs in
specific, those are all things

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.770
that we provide bindings for,
and we'll provide bindings and

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:13.460
try to map them--

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.460
MALE SPEAKER: So basically
if it's in Chrome on the

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.905
operating system, you'll
support it in

00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:19.480
the packaged app.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:24.600
ERIK KAY: So if it's in the web
view, if it's in Chrome,

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.220
the Chrome dot star APIs, we'll
try to support it as

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.710
best we can and map it to
the native equivalent.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.930
So if it's rich notifications,
we'll map the notifications to

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.270
whatever the system
can do there.

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.560
That sort of thing.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.890
And when it's part of the web
platform, we're limited to

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.710
what the web view can
do on that platform.

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.630
MALE SPEAKER: So now as far as
the messaging components go,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.560
if I use Chrome messaging and
you're in Android, will it

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.030
move the message to Android?

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.920
ERIK KAY: That's the idea,
although we don't have that

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.880
one together yet.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.320
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.250
OK, thank you very much.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.350
ERIK KAY: No problem.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.170
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.140
I'm actually an Android
developer and student who got

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.640
interested in packaged apps when
his MacBook broke down in

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.290
the middle of the summer and
spent the semester using a

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:03.860
Chromebook.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.980
I know you mentioned an IDE
for Chrome extensions in

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.270
Chrome OS, but have you guys
thought or talked at all to

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.130
the Android or other development
teams about making

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:15.650
tools for other platforms
for Chrome OS?

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.180
ERIK KAY: Oh, I see.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.640
So you want to target Android?

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.070
Yes.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.310
So in fact, one of our internal
guys has a prototype

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.690
version of ADB working on a
Chromebook that's building

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.270
using our socket and USB APIs.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.260
So yeah, it's definitely
possible, and something we're

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.450
interested in.

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.810
Some of it's going to be
harder than others.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:39.140
For example, bringing Java over
to Chrome OS is a little

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.430
more work, obviously.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.390
But we think the with the
combination of native client

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.390
and web technologies, that
we can get pretty far.

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:48.090
MALE SPEAKER: OK, and one other
question is I know that

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.160
it can compile to JavaScript,
but how does Dart play into

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.350
the Chrome packaged apps?

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.490
I know it's made more for
application development.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.470
ERIK KAY: It'll be the same as
the Chrome runtime anywhere.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.890
So you could either today,
compile it down to JavaScript,

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:02.890
and we've got that working.

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:06.090
We've got a few examples even
up in our GitHub repo.

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.530
And I didn't have a link to
that there, but definitely

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.780
check out the GitHub
Chrome examples.

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:15.760
But when a VM, a Dart VM becomes
integrated in the

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.430
Chrome runtime, assuming that
happens, then we'll just get

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.550
that for free, and we'll have
Dart findings for all of our

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:22.270
APIs as well.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:23.430
MALE SPEAKER: Cool. thank
you very much.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:24.342
ERIK KAY: Yep.

00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:28.310
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I want to
ask you about the uploading

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:31.720
process for the web store, for
the Chrome packaged apps.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.480
And actually, I am very
interested in socket API.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.540
And I have that in the Firefox
OS [? cases ?]

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.070
are using TCP socket
or UDP socket.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:46.180
They also checked the
packaged apps in a

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.730
detailed way by the human.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.450
But I want to ask you that such
a human check process

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.480
will be applied.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.320
For example, socket API is using
in the packaged apps.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.580
ERIK KAY: So I think we should
follow up afterwards, because

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.760
I didn't catch all of it, but,
all of your questions.

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.900
But it sounded like you were
asking when humans get, the

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.740
human review process
kicks in versus

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.340
automated review process.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.230
And for the apps APIs
in general,

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.150
no, it's all automated.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.650
It's really, we only have
human manual review for

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.280
extensions that use [? NP API ?]
today.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.070
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.660
I come from China.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.850
[INAUDIBLE], organizers, so I
noticed the Chromebooks for

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:38.070
Chian is only one IME.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:46.930
So I personally, the IME can
make a packaged A-P-P. So I

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.640
can customize my special IME.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:54.170
ERIK KAY: With the extension
API, you're saying?

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.420
MALE SPEAKER: IME.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:55.770
Yes.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.100
ERIK KAY: Yes, yes.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.660
So, I mean, we have an extension
API for making your

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.420
own IMEs, and so that's
documented in the extensions

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.160
system right now.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.340
I'm not an expert in that
particular one, but there's

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.570
probably some folks up and,
if you go up to the Chrome

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.300
sandbox area, we could probably
find somebody who

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.470
could help you out.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:16.720
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.220
MALE SPEAKER: So packaged app
has apps that seem to have

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.930
tons of additional
useful APIs.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.805
Is the goal for these APIs
to become web standards?

00:40:27.805 --> 00:40:29.460
ERIK KAY: So, It's
a great question.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.260
It's something that we've been
talking to other browser

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:34.010
vendors about, and other
people who are

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.020
working in this space.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.100
And we're actually really
excited about the possibility

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.610
of standardizing these.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.670
Right now we think i
little bit early.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.650
We've been interacting a little
bit with the other

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.550
folks, and sort of toying with
some of the ideas of like,

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:49.280
what could happen.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.740
And we actually were part of
forming the sys apps working

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.540
group to see if that
made sense.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.790
Like I said, it's still kind of
early on right now, because

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.510
each vendor is working towards
their own shipping product

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.940
yet, and we don't have any
forcing function that would

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.330
really require interoperability
to happen.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.810
And I think that's where
standards come from.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.320
Not by things we design in
committees up front and try to

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.840
get everybody to follow, but
really when you have multiple

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.370
implementations that want to
find a way to interoperate.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.190
And so first we have to have
everybody ship what they're

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.490
working on, and then we'll
figure out how to start

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:21.750
pushing on the interoperability
thing.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.650
But we're very interested in
that, and continuing to talk

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.730
to the other vendors about
it on a regular basis.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.800
MALE SPEAKER: When you say
what we're waiting for

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.601
everybody to ship their own
version of packaged apps, are

00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:36.176
you including the Windows 8
programming platform, which

00:41:36.176 --> 00:41:36.230
takes also--

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.800
ERIK KAY: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.402
Windows 8 has essentially
already shipped, and Boot to

00:41:39.402 --> 00:41:42.360
Gecko is close to shipping, and
[? Taizen ?] is close to

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.290
shipping their stuff.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.430
And there's a number of others
that are out there.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.740
And so we're just sort of
waiting for the forcing

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.310
functions to come that
will drive us towards

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.295
standardization.

00:41:50.295 --> 00:41:54.290
So it looks like we're over
time, so I'll stick around

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.710
afterwards to answer a few more
questions, and then I'll

00:41:56.710 --> 00:42:00.470
go up to the Chrome sandbox
area, and I'm happy to take

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:01.860
more questions from
folks there.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.210
So, thanks much, everybody.
