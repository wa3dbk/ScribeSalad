TV RAMAN: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.350
Thank you for coming to this
talk on Android accessibility

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.520
and the second day of I/O. Hope
you had a great party

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.880
last night and are ready
for a whole sequence

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.590
of talks this morning.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.960
My name is TV Raman.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380
I've been working on Android and
Chrome accessibility for

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.410
the last few years.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.140
And with me I have Casey
Burkhardt and Alan Viverette

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.230
who also work on Android
accessibility.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.009
A quick intro to what we're
going to be talking about.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.320
So this is about Android
accessibility, and we've

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.760
billed this as an advanced
developer talk.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.420
Android accessibility
is a core part

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.100
of the Android framework.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.040
And the way you should think of
what that core capability,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.700
the framework, does is think of
it as mechanisms that are

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.450
built into the platform, so that
you as a developer can

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.560
reach the largest
number of users.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.510
You heard some fairly
amazing numbers

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.519
in the keynote yesterday.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.770
I can never remember
the numbers.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.040
I think it was about
900 million Android

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.390
devices out there now.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.360
By the time we are done during
this talk, it's probably 902

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.900
million at the rate at
which things grow

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.210
What is Android as a platform
giving you the developer?

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.080
It's giving you the developer
the ability to write these

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.450
wonderfully innovative apps that
can run on a very large

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140
variety of devices.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.660
So you don't have to worry about
different screen sizes,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.880
5 inches versus 4 1/2 inches
versus 5 1/2 inches.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700
You don't have to worry about
does this phone have a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.580
keyboard or not, all
of those things.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.930
Think of the other half of the
equation, the people who use

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.700
your applications.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.210
Today, most of you are probably
targeting your

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.030
applications at users who have
perfect vision, who have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.750
perfect hand-eye coordination,
who can use the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.660
touch screen well.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.390
In a sense, you are not having
to focus as much

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.540
on the user's abilities.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.160
What we, from the accessibility
side of Android,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.590
do is to make sure that you can
continue to focus on your

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.900
app, on the core part
of your part.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.080
And the Android platform just
does the heavy lifting for you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.580
in terms of making sure that
your app just works for all

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.690
your users.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.710
But life's never that
simple, right?

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.130
If you had to code your app all
the way from the beginning

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.990
to worry about the blind user,
the low-vision user, the deaf

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.980
user, the motion-impaired
user, you would

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.012
have a very hard time.

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:37.370
Our goal is to make that
really, really easy.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.420
And for core platform APIs,
everything we talk about today

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.200
will be in the context of low
vision and blindness.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.680
But the way it does architected,
when you address

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.680
these use cases, you actually
will be covering a lot more

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.010
use cases, all the way from
one button controls for

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.270
somebody who's severely
motion-impaired to the blind

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.020
user who cannot see at all.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.470
We've done previous talks about
the core accessibility

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.280
layer in Android.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.600
And I highly recommend our talk
from last year which gave

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.340
a very detailed overview of
the features in Jellybean.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.910
This year, what we will do is
Casey will first take you

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.180
quickly through some of the
accessibility basics as a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.300
quick revision.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.960
And then Alan will go through
in detail about the next

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.330
level, which is what if
you're designing an

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.940
entirely a custom UI.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.770
As I said the Android platform
with its built-in

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.590
accessibility, with its built-in
view layer, has

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.660
accessibility support
for all the widgets.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.680
But what if you've decided to
create a completely new

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.550
experience?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.020
How do you easily make
that then accessible.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.250
So that will be the second
half of this talk.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.640
We will have office hours.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.230
We will give you details on the
office hours again towards

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.040
the end of the talk.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.180
We also have a sandbox
downstairs where you can see

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.630
accessibility technologies both
from us at Google as well

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.170
as from our partners.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.390
So enjoy the talk.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.360
I look forward to your
questions at the end.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.610
And take it away, Casey.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.180
CASEY BURKHARDT: Thanks Raman.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.040
Hi, everyone.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.815
I'm Casey Burkhardt.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.780
I'm a software engineer
on the Accessibility

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.540
Engineering Team at Google.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.810
And as Raman mentioned, I'm
going to go through some of

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.390
the accessibility basics
on Android.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.640
So accessibility is
exposed through

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.420
accessibility services.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.110
The framework provides
information about user

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.290
interaction to these services
through objects called

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.040
accessibility events.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.010
These are presented as
accessibility services which

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.430
had a privilege level that's a
bit higher than other services

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.330
to receive information about
this user interaction.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.850
So we get information about
notification, movement of

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.840
focus, how the user interacts
with apps.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.820
And the accessibility service
is responsible for providing

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.080
feedback for that.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.840
We ship two accessibility
services right now.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.080
The first is TalkBack, which
is a screen reader that's

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.270
optimized for the
touch screen.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.500
What we do is we allow for
different types of navigation

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.030
throughout your application
and throughout Android.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.900
We allow random access through
a feature called

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.390
ExploreByTouch, which allows a
users to use a single finger

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.560
to interrogate the screen
and explore what

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.850
they're currently touching.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.950
The accessibility service gets
information about that

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.730
interaction and provides
feedback to the user.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.890
We also provide access to this
onscreen content linearly.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.220
So if a user is unfamiliar with
an interface, they can

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.780
navigate it item by item
to see everything

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.070
that's on the screen.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.360
TalkBack provides all this
feedback through

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.890
text-to-speech as well as
vibration feedback and

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.250
auditory icons.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.050
But we also ship another
service, BrailleBack, which

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.220
works in a similar way but
provides feedback on a

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.370
refreshable Braille display.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.400
So this is a device that
connects to the Android phone

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.430
or tablet through Bluetooth and
actually changes its state

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.860
of little actuator pins,
so the user can read

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.325
Braille on the fly.

00:05:57.325 --> 00:06:00.535
The user can also click on
individual cells which result

00:06:00.535 --> 00:06:03.380
in click actions being sent to
the view that represents the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.405
text from that cell and can also
pan through the entire

00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:08.060
onscreen content to
see everything

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.570
that's on the screen.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.900
Most of these Braille devices
also include a built-in

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.670
keyboard, so the user
can even enter text.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.890
All of these things combine to
allow the user to drive the

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.830
phone or tablet from inside
their pocket just with this

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.080
Braille display.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.660
A key tenet of accessibility in
Jellybean and above is the

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.780
idea of accessibility focus.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.780
It works just like system input
focus, but it's assigned

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.100
by an accessibility focused to
any view in the interface.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.960
So as a user interacts with the
device, the service gets

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.705
events about the interaction and
can decide to assign focus

00:06:43.705 --> 00:06:45.790
to anywhere in the
user interface.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.000
Focus is indicated by this
yellow highlight you see

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.650
around the clock widget here.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.860
And when something receives
focus, the service is intended

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.100
to speak or provide some sort
of feedback to the user.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.240
Focus is also the point of
interaction for any events or

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.360
actions that occur from
that point forward.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.270
So for example, if I double tap
while this widget receives

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.810
focus, the clock widget will
receive a click event.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.850
If I double tap and hold my
finger down, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.870
will receive a long click
event, and so forth.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.910
So it's up to the accessibility
service about

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.640
how to assign this focus.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.420
In TalkBack, we use a heuristic
based on whether a

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.460
view is actionable or not to
determine focusability.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.660
So what we do is we take a look
at the view hierarchy.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.670
We see that a view is either
clickable or focusable, and we

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.540
mark that view as a candidate
to receive

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.210
accessibility focus.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.130
When we traverse the hierarchy,
we take these

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.120
candidates and we assign focus
to them in the order that the

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.820
user intends through
their interaction.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.080
And failing to find actionable
content, we fall back to

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.110
actual text content.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.950
So if you don't have focusable
or clickable content in your

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.710
application, but you still have
text or labeled images,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:57.960
we'll focus those as well.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.990
So here's an example of that.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.320
What we have here is the folder
widget from the home

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.380
screen that comes default in
most stock Android devices.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.220
And what we're interested here
in is a folder icon.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.260
You see the folder icon object,
outlined in yellow in

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.980
this hierarchy viewer tree,
is the current node with

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.540
accessibility focus.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.960
When TalkBack traverses the
hierarchy, we see that this

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.370
view is clickable.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.700
So we say oh, this is an actual
piece of content.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.590
We should give it accessibility
focus.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.120
When the user navigates to this
point in the hierarchy,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.539
we select this view, search
down and traverse its

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.250
children, and populate speech
with the content of its

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.049
children nodes.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.140
So for this example, the image
view is labeled with the

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.049
content description--

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:43.870
folder--

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.690
and the bubble text view
has the text--

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.240
Google.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.390
So TalkBack will speak
Folder, Google.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.590
So now let's switch over to a
demo, and we'll quickly show

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.880
how TalkBack will work with your
application, how users

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.930
will use ExploreByTouch and
linear navigation to move

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.580
through your user interface.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.550
And then we'll do a quick demo
of Braille and introduce our

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.870
new virtual Braille display.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.090
So here we have an Android
device running the latest

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.830
version of Jellybean.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.370
All accessibility on the
platform can be enabled

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.430
through a common location.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.530
It lives in Settings,
Accessibility.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.590
And you can see it lists all
the services that are

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.440
currently installed.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.370
Here we have TalkBack
and BrailleBack.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.160
To enable a service, just tap it
and flip its switch to on.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.170
You'll receive a warning that
it's a privileged service.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.470
It can do things like retrieve
interaction events and get

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.340
onscreen content.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.240
You accept the warning, and the
service is now running.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.310
As I navigate through the user
interface with a single

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.570
finger, I can actually get
feedback for the content that

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.160
I'm currently touching.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.200
ANDROID: When TalkBack is on,
your device provides spoken

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.680
feedback to help blind
and low-vision users.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.160
For example, it describes
what you touch--

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.050
CASEY BURKHARDT: So I covered
the proximity sensor to

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.170
Silence Speech.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.960
I can continue to navigate
around the interface--

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.855
ANDROID: When TalkBack
is on, on switch--

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.100
3.5 [? g-note ?].

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.720
CASEY BURKHARDT: Let's
now stop TalkBack.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.200
ANDROID: OK.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.020
Cancel but--

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.400
Settings.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.060
CASEY BURKHARDT: To activate
something in the interface--

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.730
ANDROID: When TalkBack is on--

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.325
CASEY BURKHARDT: I
give it focus--

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:16.610
ANDROID: Settings.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.950
CASEY BURKHARDT: And
I double tap.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.750
ANDROID: TalkBack Settings.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.160
CASEY BURKHARDT: That sends a
click event to that button,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.550
and fires the Click Listener,
and opens TalkBack Settings.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.310
If I'm unfamiliar with this
interface, I can actually

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.570
navigate it item by item.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.440
And here's how I do that.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.400
I just do that with a series
of Swype gestures.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.120
ANDROID: TalkBack Settings.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.090
Speech.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.160
Speech Volume.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.770
Match media volume.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:39.280
CASEY BURKHARDT: And so forth.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.230
I can move back by Swyping
the opposite direction.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.920
ANDROID: Speech.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.910
CASEY BURKHARDT: We also provide
quick access to common

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.380
system functions, like pulling
down the notification shade.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.820
ANDROID: Notification shade.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.760
CASEY BURKHARDT:
Or going back.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.380
ANDROID: TalkBack settings.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.350
CASEY BURKHARDT: We also have a
great tool called the Global

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.470
Context Menu, which allows a
user to quickly access common

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.120
tasks within TalkBack.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.740
For example, it's very important
sometimes to be able

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:08.630
to read all the content
on the screen at once.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.800
ANDROID: Touch the screen and
explore in a circle to find an

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.570
item, then lift to select.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.780
Read from top.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.360
TalkBack settings.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.000
Speech.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.080
Speech volume.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.650
Match media volume.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.820
Use pitch changes.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.810
Speak keyboard feedback and--

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.170
speech.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.790
CASEY BURKHARDT: And
I'll touch the

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.340
screen to silence it.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.210
ANDROID: Speech volume.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.730
Match media--

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.620
CASEY BURKHARDT: So you can see
that accessibility moved

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.460
on its own.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.630
It would read through the entire
user interface and

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.210
describe to the user
what's there.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.440
This is a great tool for
developers too, because it

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.290
allows them to open up an
activity, enable reading from

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.810
top, look at each item as it
receives accessibility focus,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.670
and ensure that the spoken
description is

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.050
accurate for that item.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.990
If something's unlabeled,
mislabeled, or doesn't receive

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.570
accessibility focus, it's really
easy to tell which

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.550
widget you need to look into
to improve the experience.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.455
So in addition to TalkBack,
we have BrailleBack.

00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:05.030
Let's enable that.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:10.700
ANDROID: Back, Settings, Back,
Accessibility, Show--

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.020
BrailleBack off.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.780
Settings.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.400
Off switch.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.190
Alert use BrailleBack.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:19.260
OK button.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.280
Settings.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.940
CASEY BURKHARDT: So now
BrailleBack is running.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.330
And I've actually enabled in
BrailleBack Settings, which

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.450
you can get by clicking the
Settings button there, a

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.300
virtual Braille display.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.720
So because we don't have a
refreshable Braille display

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.960
connected through Bluetooth
right now, it's incredibly

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.780
useful to be able to see what's
on a virtual display

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.390
especially for developers.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.600
So what we see here is an
overlay on the bottom of the

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.480
screen that actually shows what
would appear on a Braille

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.810
display with its human readable
translation below in

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.230
actual ASCII text.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.580
So this gives you an idea of,
if you navigate through your

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.930
interface, what your users
will see on the Braille

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.000
display when they're using
your application.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.910
ANDROID: Navigate up.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.390
On switch.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.900
CASEY BURKHARDT: So you can see
that the display updates.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.632
ANDROID: When BrailleBack
is on--

00:13:05.632 --> 00:13:06.520
CASEY BURKHARDT: OK.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.008
ANDROID: Alert.

00:13:09.008 --> 00:13:09.920
CASEY BURKHARDT: Great.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.730
Another great feature of
TalkBack is you can turn it

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.115
off really quickly.

00:13:13.115 --> 00:13:15.620
You go back to the Global
Context Menu and just go to a

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.090
Pause Feedback.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.660
ANDROID: Pause Feedback.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.605
CASEY BURKHARDT: And it's off.

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:21.855
OK.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.980
So let's talk briefly about what
you as developers need to

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.270
do to make your applications
successful.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.420
All of this content is
in our previous years

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.780
talk in greater detail.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.080
So I encourage you, if you're
interested, go back and look

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.155
at those talks from 2011 and
2012 regarding Android

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.120
accessibility.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.280
You'll get this content
in more depth.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.650
The first thing to know about
accessibility within native

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.550
applications is that the widgets
that ship with the

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.690
platform, as part of
the SDK, are all

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.320
accessible to begin with.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.130
A lot of time is gone into
instrumenting these for

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.720
accessibility, and we provide a
really great experience for

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.060
all the built-in widgets.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.690
So whenever possible, use
built-in widgets within your

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:05.960
application.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.850
If you do need to create a
custom widget, some class of

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.390
view that is as deep in the
class hierarchy as possible,

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.390
so you get the benefit of having
the accessibility bits

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.650
in that widget.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.100
So there are some widgets that
need a little extra care.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.430
And these are widgets that are
essentially nontext-based, in

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.750
particular, Image View
and Image button.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.110
Because there's no textual
content to speaker put on a

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.660
Braille display for a user, it's
important that you as the

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.220
developer provide one.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.650
This is done through the
android:setContentDescription

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.880
attribute in your layout.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.100
And you'll want to make sure
you provide a translatable

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.340
stream for that.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.580
If you have a view that's
entirely decorative and

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.050
probably isn't important for
accessibility, you can set a

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.450
content description null.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.600
This will do two things.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.160
It will fix all your
lint errors.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.040
You'll see your link warnings
because of lack of content

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.000
descriptions.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.765
And it will also indicate to
accessibility services that

00:14:57.765 --> 00:14:59.920
their concept probably
isn't worth receiving

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.820
accessibility focus.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.020
If you have content that
updates throughout the

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.920
lifecycle of your
application--

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.090
for example, a play/pause button
that changes state--

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.520
you can use the
View.SetContentDescription

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.200
method to dynamically
update the view

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.550
when its meaning changes.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:21.180
And finally, if you've got one
view that is intended to label

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.460
another and has an appropriate
description, you can use the

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.890
Android label for attribute to
indicate to TalkBack or other

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.450
accessibility services that
you're providing a label

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.840
through another view.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.350
If you have a hybrid application
or use web content

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.960
within your application,
be sure to use W3C web

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.810
accessibility initiatives,
standards and guidelines to

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.880
ensure that the web content
is accessible.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.460
We do provide access to web
content for accessibility

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.690
services through an injected
version of ChromeVox.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.240
There was a talk on
that yesterday.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.620
And stop by our sandbox
to see a demo.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.120
And if you find yourself in a
situation where you do have to

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.390
write an entirely custom widget
yourself, there are

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.660
framework APIs that allow you
to do this, but it does

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.760
require a good bit
of extra work.

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.180
The good news, though,
is it can be done.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.230
And the better news is we've
created a helper class that

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.240
helps you do that.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.420
For purposes of example,
we'll use a custom

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.480
view that we've created.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.300
It's bar graph view.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.210
This view is constructed and
populated with a title that

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:30.080
you see on top there and a set
of data and an interray where

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.060
each value in that array
represents the value of a bar

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.920
in the bar graph.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.110
So the user can click on
bars to highlight them.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.370
And we actually draw all of
the content from this view

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.270
with on draw.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.480
There's no internal views
that are used.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.370
We actually render the text
to a canvas, so we're not

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.990
actually using a Text View at
all within this application.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.710
We also really set it focusable,
or provide any sort

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.590
of description initially.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.280
And for click events, we
actually don't use a standard

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.859
click listener, we listen for
touch events and implement our

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.109
own click listener.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:10.480
So this is basically a perfect
storm for accessibility.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.920
When you interrogate this view
with TalkBack and you move

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.109
focus to it, it speaks
nothing.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.190
In fact, it doesn't even receive
focus, because there's

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.109
no actual content to speak.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:26.329
This is an example of really
the worst case scenario for

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.560
the accessible user, when they
try to use your application

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.920
and there's a view that's
just entirely empty.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.890
Luckily, we have an answer--

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.930
an easy way for you as
developers to make this widget

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:37.560
accessible.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.400
So I'll hand it off to Alan
who's going to demonstrate our

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.565
new helper class.

00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:42.970
ALAN VIVERETTE: Thanks, Casey.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.180
Hi, I'm Alan Viverette.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.630
I'm a software engineer on
the accessibility team.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.060
And I'll be showing you how you
can make your custom views

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.010
totally accessible,
support all of the

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.480
features in Jelly Bean.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.680
But first, who here has
written an Android

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.450
application?

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.060
Quite a few.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:57.820
Awesome.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.130
So who here's written custom
views for an Android

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.630
application?

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.350
Still quite a lot of people.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.650
So if you're just using standard
widgets, you're off

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.720
to a really good start.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.940
If you're using custom views,
you have a little bit more

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.790
work to do.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.060
But first, let's take a
step back and think

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.680
about what's in a view?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.150
So we've got our sample
bar graph on screen.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.430
And visually, it's somewhere
on the screen.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.200
It's got some dimensions.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.640
It has some information that
it's conveying to the user,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.780
here through both graphics
and text.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.070
And it has an interaction
model.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.810
So I can click on these bars
to change what's displayed.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:33.260
But each of these bars has
its own dimensions and

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:33.800
positioning.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.260
It has its own information
that it's

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.290
conveying to the user.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.670
It has its own interaction.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.440
Each bar is individually
clickable.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.470
And because we're not extending
view group and using

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:45.620
subviews, we actually have to
expose this to accessibility

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.470
services some other way.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.280
So now let's move to
accessibility node info, which

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.850
is how an accessibility service
sees the views in your

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.110
application.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.300
Again, you have dimensions
and positioning.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.780
You have some sort of
information that you're

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.250
conveying to the user.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.320
You have some sort of
interaction model-- clicking,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.360
long clicking, scrolling,
et cetera.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.500
And most importantly,
we have child nodes.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.660
So even if your view isn't a
view group and doesn't have

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.440
subviews, You can still expose
extra accessibility node info

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.080
as children of your
top level view.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.870
So that's what we're
going to do here.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.520
Each bar is going to have an
accessibility node info that

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.840
exposes its information to
an accessibility service.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.250
How do we do that?

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.810
There's an accessibility node
provider class built into the

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.620
framework that allows you to
create new nodes and expose

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.970
those to the framework.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.150
So here we've got--

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.070
oh, it looks like the
sample code doesn't

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.840
all fit on the screen.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.162
Let's shrink that down a bit.

00:19:42.162 --> 00:19:45.390
Oh, we're still able to fit
everything on the screen.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.780
It looks like there's a lot of
code that's required to use an

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.440
accessibility node provider.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.740
And in fact, there are about
12 more slides of this that

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.990
I'm not going to go through.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.170
Instead, we've made an
accessibility helper class

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.920
called ExploreByTouch helper.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.320
This is going to simplify
creating and exposing a

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.110
virtual view hierarchy,
with just five

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.130
simple abstract methods.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.947
This still wraps
AccessibilityNod

00:20:06.947 --> 00:20:10.470
eProviderCompat, which means
there's a lot of code on the

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.660
back end that you won't have
to look at, fortunately.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.150
This also means it's going to
work out of the box with

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.360
screen readers, with Braille
displays, and with some

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.280
interfaces that you may have
never even seen before, like

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.580
some Sip-and-Puff
or SingleSwitch.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.310
Most importantly, this
is backwards

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.890
compatible with API 4.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.250
So even if you're targeting
Doughnut, you can still have

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.770
full Jellybean quality
accessibility in your

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.780
application.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:38.790
So how do we start using the
ExploreByTouchHelper class?

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.310
Well, first, we're going to need
to delegate handling of

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.150
certain events, both
accessibility events and touch

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.960
events for when touch
exploration is turned on.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.640
We're going to actually map the
touch events from touch

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.680
exploration to logical items
within our view.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.520
In this case, they'll be bars.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.620
And we're going to need to
expose information about these

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.640
bars to accessibility
services.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.050
So these are things like
positioning and size on

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.380
screen, actions that are
supported and informational

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.180
content, in the form of
a content description.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.090
We're also going to need to
provide support for user

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.190
interaction.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.150
So a user can click on a bar,
and we need to have some way

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:16.930
to interact with that, change
what's displayed on screen,

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.400
and let the framework know
what's going on.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.890
And finally, we're going to
test our application.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.230
We're going to make sure that
the same information that's

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.420
displayed visually is exposed to
accessibility services and

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.300
can be spoken out loud
or displayed it

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.370
on a Braille display.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:36.500
So first, let's move over to the
device and take a look at

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.810
the application with
accessibility turned off.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.680
We've got our pretty blue
graph on the screen.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.980
We can touch them and
they turn yellow.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:48.880
We can see that it says bar
graph inaccessible.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.420
And for each bar, we can see how
high it is compared to the

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.070
other bars.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.526
Let's turn on accessibility.

00:21:55.526 --> 00:21:58.380
ANDROID: Bar Graph I/O 2013.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.030
ALAN VIVERETTE: And as Casey
mentioned, we're just going to

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.270
Read From Top to read everything
on the screen.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:04.520
ANDROID: Bar graph I/--

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.420
Touch the Read From Top.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.120
Bar graph I/O 2013.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.440
ALAN VIVERETTE: And it's done.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.080
So obviously, we're missing
some content here.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.950
We'd probably like to read
Bar Graph Inaccessible.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.963
And we'd like to get some
information out of these bars

00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:23.870
that are shown on screen.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.060
So let's start implementing
some support for

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:28.490
accessibility, using our
TouchHelper class.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.550
The first thing we need to do,
as I mentioned, is delegate

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.010
accessibility support.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.580
So we're first going to create a
new BarGraphTouchhelper that

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.720
extends our ExploreByTouchHelper
class.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.590
We'll go into the implementation
details on that

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.780
in just a moment.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.890
But the first thing we're
going to do is delegate

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.280
responsibility for accessibility
to this class

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.530
using ViewCompat.setAc
cessibilityDelegate.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.170
We're also going to dispatch
hover events first to our

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.810
TouchHelper class, because when
ExploreByTouch is turned

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:59.740
on, touching the screen is
translated into hover events.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.840
We need to handle these hover
events specially to let the

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.650
framework know if we're touching
a logical item.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.330
So we're delegating in
two places here.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.280
And once we've done that, we can
start thinking about the

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.110
implementation for our class.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.500
One thing that we're going to
need to worry about is mapping

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.580
our logical items to something
that the framework

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.600
understands.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.720
In this case, the framework is
going to use a virtual view id

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.930
to reference our
logical items.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.290
So every view in the framework,
every actual view,

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.610
has a virtual view ID
that gets computed.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.540
We're going to provide our own
virtual view IDs so that when

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.710
the framework says, could you
give me the first child and

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.500
the second child, the third
child, we know what they're

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.550
talking about.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.510
We have to make some guarantees
about these virtual

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.140
view ids, namely, that they're
one-to-one, which means for

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.550
every virtual view ID, there is
only one logical item that

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.280
it refers to.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.210
And for every logical item, it
has only one virtual view ID.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.380
We're also going to make sure
that they're stable, which

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.500
means that when we refer to
virtual view id 0, it's always

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.570
going to refer to the
same logical item.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.690
We also have to make sure that
they're non-negative.

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:06.000
there's certain negative virtual
view ids that are used

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.690
internally by the framework.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.120
So we have half range, which
is a good amount of

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.420
virtual view ids.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.470
For a bar graph view, we can
actually just reuse the data

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.520
rate indices.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.620
So we passed in an interray when
we were creating it, and

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.120
we're displaying these bars on
screen in the order that they

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.350
are in in the interray.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.920
So our first bar, index 0,
is at the very far left.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.090
We can go ahead and assign
that virtual view id 0.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.840
We can maintain this mapping for
all of the array indices

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.730
in their array, because it's
one-to-one, it's stable, and

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.460
because it's an array index,
it has to be non-negative.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.370
So we'll just map directly,
virtual view id,

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.970
index within the array.

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.240
Now that we have a mapping, we
can start to expose some of

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.020
the on screen content to
accessibility services.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:52.010
So the first thing we're
going to do is override

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:53.250
getVirtualViewIdAt.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.570
This is the first of five
methods that we've be

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:57.100
overriding in this class.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.750
We're going to take an xy
coordinate on the screen in

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.560
view relative coordinates, so 0,
0 is the top left of my bar

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.860
graph view.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.220
And we're going to reuse the
same method we used for hit

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.370
detection in onTouchEvent.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:12.870
So you noticed during the demo
with accessibility turned off,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.100
I could touch a bar and
it would change color.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.670
That's because I'm overriding
onTouchEvent in my view.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.090
I'm taking the xy coordinate,
figuring out which bar the

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.680
user is touching and changing
some of its properties.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.100
So we can just reuse this
method, return to the

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.480
index in the array.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.760
Because I'm mapping directly
for indexed to virtual view

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.360
id, I just check to see whether
I got a valid index.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.070
If I did, I return it.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.490
If I didn't, I return
the special constant

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.300
ExploreByTouchHe
lper.INVALID_ID.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.950
And what this tells the
ExploreByTouchHelper class is

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.460
that the user touched the
screen, but they didn't touch

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.440
any of the logical items within
my view, which means

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.370
most likely the touch will
fall to the view itself.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.350
If it's not handled by the view
itself, it might fall

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.240
under that.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.170
We're also going to override
getVisibleVirtualViewIds,

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.990
method two of five that we'll
be overriding, and this lets

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:03.790
the framework know both the
items that are visible on

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.130
screen through virtual
view IDs.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.860
And the order in which we'd like
them to be navigated by

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.220
Swype navigation.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:15.040
So as long as I populate this 0
1 2 3 4, as the user swipes

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:20.210
right, they'll hit bar 0, bar
1, bar 2, bar 3, in order.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.390
If I have something more
complicated, say I have two

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.970
rows of bars and maybe I want
to do the first bar, the

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.900
second bar, the third
bar, the fourth bar.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.300
As long as I pass those into
the array in the same order

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.170
that I want them to be
navigated, that's what the

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.200
user will see.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.220
So now we have those two down,
what else do we need to do?

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.400
Well, once a user touches
something, TalkBack is going

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.950
to speak, BrailleBack
is going to display

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:43.980
something on the screen.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.270
We need to expose information
that we convey to the user.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.130
So the first thing we need to
think about is what type of

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.800
information.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.940
When something is spoken out
loud, you have to think about

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.480
the efficiency and the
importance of the items that

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.650
you're trying to convey.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.900
So here each bar has
two properties--

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.490
its indexes within the array--

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.040
where it's displayed
on screen--

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.710
and its value.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.660
And we want when a user touches
the screen at random

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.580
them to know where they
are, what type of

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.810
items they're touching.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.980
So we're going to
say bar first.

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.660
Bar is really short, and so a
user, if they're moving around

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.400
the screen very quickly, isn't
going to have to wait very

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.290
long to know what they're
touching.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.990
And if they're trying to
distinguish between different

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.430
bars on screen, they'll very
quickly hear the index.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.530
So we'll speak something
like bar 0, value 5.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.330
And because we have a
highlighted state, we're going

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:33.750
to provide a separate content
description that says

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.470
something like bar 0,
value 5 highlighted.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.500
We've just written a quick
helper method here that takes

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.380
an index within the array,
gets the value, check the

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.380
highlighted property, and
populates the right template,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:46.580
returns a string.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.950
We're going to use that string
to populate a content

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.320
description for a accessibility
event.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.800
So this is the third method
that we're overriding,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.050
populateEventForVirtualViewId.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.890
Accessibility events are used
by the framework to let the

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.970
accessibility service know
what's going on your

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:02.760
application.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.310
So for example, when you click
on a view, there's a view

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.250
click to that.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:08.390
When you scroll, there's
a view scrolled event.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.200
We're going to populate these
with the right content

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.660
description for the logical item
that's sending the event.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.990
We also need to expose a little
bit more information

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:18.510
about nodes.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.900
We can expose the content
description as we did in the

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.100
accessibility event.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.830
We're also going to
expose the user

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.680
interactions that are supported.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.150
And here, you may remember, I
was able to tap on a bar to

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.270
change its properties.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.150
So we're going to add
a click event.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.180
So that if the user double taps
on the screen, or if a

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.460
user clicks on their Braille
display, it will have the same

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.970
behavior as if I had tapped it
with accessibility turned off.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.360
We're also going to set the
bounds within the parent view

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.270
using getBoundsForIndex.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.570
Now this is the same method that
we're using in onDraw to

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.630
figure out where to draw the bar
onscreen when we fill it

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.220
with that blue color and
occasionally we fill it with

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.250
that yellow highlight.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.330
And this is going to ensure
consistency with our onDraw,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.980
so that exactly where you touch
on screen is exactly

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.870
where our yellow focus highlight
will be placed and

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.480
exactly where you'll get
feedback for a logical item.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.390
So you may notice,
we're reusing

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.770
methods pretty heavily.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.290
And this is why it's so easy to
use ExploreByTouchHelper to

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.160
implement accessibility
in your custom view.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.270
All right, so now that we've
exposed properties about our

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.700
items, let's take another look
at our application and see how

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.260
it looks with accessibility
turned on now.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.270
All right, so we'll switch
over to our bar graph

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:39.000
interactive and, when I
do Read All From Top--

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.780
ANDROID: Read from top.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.450
Bar graph 1/0 2013.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.780
Bar 0, value minus 5.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.930
Bar 1, value minus 4.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.110
Bar 2, value minus 2.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.930
Bar 3, value 0.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.660
Bar 4, value 2.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.440
Bar 5, value 4.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.710
Bar 6, value 5.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:57.140
ALAN VIVERETTE: All right.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.130
So we're reading out the
bar descriptions.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:29:59.730
That's great.

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.500
We've got the yellow focus
highlight onscreen.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.430
That's awesome.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.100
Let's touch it and make sure
that it works correctly.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.450
ANDROID: Bar 5, bar
4, bar 3, bar 1.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:10.140
Value minus 4.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:10.470
ALAN VIVERETTE: Right?

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.910
Everything seems pretty close.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.400
But we're missing one important
thing here.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.480
That's the title of
the bar graph.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.140
So we need some way to expose
this to the user.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.260
We're going to do this--

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.460
oh, sorry, the next thing we're
going to do is Respond

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.940
To Actions.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.140
So we're going to be
able to click on a

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.920
view by double tapping.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.060
So when we added our
ACTION_CLICK in populate node,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.820
we need to also handle that
later by overriding the

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:45.720
performActionForVirtualViewID
method.

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.180
We're going to use the same
method we used in onTouchEvent

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.110
to actually perform
the bar click.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.650
So we've got onBar clicked.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.110
This is going to invalidate the
view so that it's redrawn

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.190
with the highlight.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.600
This is going to change the
internal highlight state, so

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.760
that we can draw that bar
with a different color.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.090
And that's the only action
that we need to handle,

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:06.510
because that's the only
action then we

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:08.550
added in populate node.

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:11.370
We also need to let the
framework know that the action

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.010
happened successfully.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:16.340
So we're going to invalidate
the virtual view id because

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.610
we're changing the
highlight state.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.120
We're changing a property
of the virtual view.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.240
And we're going to send an event
for that virtual view

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.160
that lets the framework know it
performed a click action.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.010
So we send event for virtual
view ID, which is a method on

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.650
our TouchHelper class, with
TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.930
This will provide feedback in
the framework, a little haptic

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.920
feedback and a little auditory
feedback, that lets it know

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:43.030
and lets the user know that
something happened.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:47.080
So now we have support for user
interaction, do one last

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.890
thing and go back
to the device.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.140
So we already read through.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.000
We noticed that we're
missing one thing.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.520
Let's make sure that
touching--

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.210
ANDROID: Bar 5, value 4.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:02.100
ALAN VIVERETTE: --and clicking
work correctly.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.720
So we're good there, and now
if we touch the bar again,

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.980
ANDROID: Bar 5, value
4 highlighted.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.335
ALAN VIVERETTE: All right.

00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:08.590
And we hear highlighted.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.360
So we're good to go there.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.490
We have one thing missing
that I mentioned.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.010
When we touch the bar graph
itself, we should really be

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:17.760
reading bar graph interactive.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.800
And we might want to provide
some additional information to

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.320
the user just to give them an
idea of what's onscreen there.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.530
So we're going to polish
the user experience.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.830
We're going to add another
string that describes the bar

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.080
graph view itself.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.380
So we're going to populate the
string with the title of the

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.510
bar graph, the type of widget
that it is, and the number of

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:40.620
bars that are on the screen.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.560
The ordering here is
very important.

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.440
So when I touch the bar graph,
what I really want to know is

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.090
what is it that I'm touching?

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.060
It's a bar graph with a title.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.010
If I have multiple bar graphs
onscreen, the most important

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:53.830
thing to me is going to be
what's shown in that bar

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.220
graph, what's the title.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.420
The second most important thing
is the type of widget.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.360
It's a bar graph, which lets
me know that it's going to

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.190
contain a couple of subviews
and the type of information

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.195
that will be seen.

00:33:03.195 --> 00:33:06.220
I'm also going to say how
many bars are shown.

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:07.410
This is a little extra.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.690
And this just tells the user
how many things they can

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.080
expect to touch when they're
moving their finger across the

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.590
screen or Swyping
left and right.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.235
So we have a setTitle method
that we've implemented on our

00:33:18.235 --> 00:33:19.390
bar graph view.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.010
This sets the internal title
which is drawn onscreen.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.950
This invalidates the view,
which redraws the title.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.150
And we're going to set the
content description based on

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.060
the bar count by populating
this template that we've

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.200
created with the title
and bar count.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.830
So now we've tested and we've
ensured the same information

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.590
that we can see visually
onscreen is communicated to an

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:46.090
accessibility service, let's go
back to the application and

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.660
do Read All From Top
to make sure that

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.910
everything makes sense.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.790
ANDROID: Bar graph I/--

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:55.910
Read From Top.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:58.510
Bar graph I/O 2013.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.880
Bar graph Accessible.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.400
Showing seven bars.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.100
Bar 0, value minus 5.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.010
ALAN VIVERETTE: And we
just saw this so I'm

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:05.850
going to skip it.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.850
But as you can see, my bar graph
view, despite not being

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.500
a view group, not having any
views inside of it, is now

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.060
totally transparently
accessible

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.670
using Jellybean APIs.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.760
And this runs on Doughnut.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.030
It won't have the same Jellybean
accessibility.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.630
But your application will
still compile and run

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.860
perfectly fine.

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.900
So just to summarize the
ExploreByTouchHelper class, it

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.020
looked like it was going to be
really difficult to implement

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.540
custom view accessibility.

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.980
But it's actually really easy.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.210
It's five methods that
you override.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.670
And you're just reusing things
that you've already written

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.679
for the visual aspect
of your application.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.570
So to conclude the talk, writing
accessible Android

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.150
applications is actually very
easy, especially if you're

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:54.750
using built-in Android widgets,
adding content

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:56.690
descriptions where appropriate,
maybe you're

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.370
associating labels
with controls.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.930
If you're using custom views,
you may want to use the

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.460
ExploreByTouchHelper class
to simplify things--

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.065
a very easy way to make your
application accessible.

00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:09.730
And if you're using web content,
just follow best

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.600
practices for web
accessibility.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.160
Now if you do all of these
things, your application is

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.430
going to be accessible
to more users.

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.430
Every Android phone has
accessibility baked in.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.630
If you pull out your phone,
you go to Settings

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.180
Accessibility, you can turn
on TalkBack yourself

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.630
and you can try this.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.940
If you have a Braille display,
or if you don't have a Braille

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.650
display, you can use the overlay
to check BrailleBack

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.440
with your application.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.640
There are also various other
ways of interacting with the

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.660
device, including Sip-and-Puff
interfaces and switch access.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.080
If it works with TalkBack, if
it works with BrailleBack,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.620
there's a very good chance that
it'll work perfectly with

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.980
these alternate interfaces.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.610
So Android's built-in
accessibility support

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:53.340
guarantees that if you have good
accessibility, you have a

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.470
good application, and you have
good usability for everyone,

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.730
you'll have a larger
user base.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.120
You'll have happier users.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.650
So I hope everybody learned
something here today.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.910
You can check out the source
code from the slides on

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.920
eyes-free.googlecode.com.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.520
We've got demos in the sandbox
here on a second floor.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.290
And we've got office
hours immediately

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.390
following the talk.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:16.040
We also have plenty of
time for questions.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.000
So please stand at the
microphones in the aisles if

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.640
you have any questions, and
we will answer them.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.054
Thanks again.

00:36:24.054 --> 00:36:32.420
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.670
ALAN VIVERETTE: Any questions?

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.370
AUDIENCE: My name
is Steve Jacobs.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.650
And I really don't
have a question.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:51.190
I'm not even a developer.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:55.130
But we have an Android
development company.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.560
And one thing that wasn't
mentioned during the session

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.220
is the business driver behind
accessible design, above and

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:07.570
beyond accommodating the access
needs of people with

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.260
disabilities.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.030
And you could tell I'm an
accessibility advocate.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.730
But if you look at our global
market and you look at the top

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:21.170
five highest potential markets,
they spell cyber--

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.280
C-I-B-I-R--

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.690
China, India, Brazil Indonesia
and Russia.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:28.410
If you look at the number of
people who never learned to

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:31.060
read, this can help them.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:35.780
If you look at the number of
people who are aging, like me,

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.690
you're talking half
a billion people.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.730
A billion and a half or more
people never learned to read.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.720
There are English language
learners.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.600
Being able to highlight text
as it's being read, using

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.490
text-to-speech can help them.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.290
In addition to people with
print disabilities--

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.380
and we're not just talking
about blindness and other

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.110
vision impairments--

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:02.110
but learning disabilities,
cognitive disabilities,

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:07.620
mobility disabilities, and
learning disabilities, which

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.970
represents about 25% of
students in class.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:17.230
50% of students taking math
have difficulty with math.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:22.020
Accompanying learning math with
text-to-speech, having

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.650
images read out, having text
highlighted, having math

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:29.160
formulas read to you actually
strengthens the learning

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.480
experience.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.010
So accessibility is about far
more than just accommodating

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:36.890
people with disabilities.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.580
And I wanted to make sure that
the message got out loud and

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.850
clear during this session.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.610
So I hope you don't mind my
taking the mic to say that.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.290
Thanks.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:52.900
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.700
TV RAMAN: Thank you for
saying that, Steve.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.030
And to echo what Steve said,
you heard the numbers

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:00.500
yesterday, the number of
devices, you heard the number

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.850
of app downloads.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:05.090
But more importantly, you heard
the number of people in

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:08.320
the world who don't yet have
access to technology.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:13.160
And as Steve pointed out, as we
start touching that segment

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.950
of the world's population that
isn't yet touched by

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.300
technology, all of these things
that we're showing you

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.370
and that we are showing
you in our sandbox are

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.800
really, really relevant.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.410
And in terms of advancing
education, in terms of

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.650
advancing access to technology,
in terms of

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.700
bettering people's lives, the
impact you have is huge.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.260
And as Alan pointed out, it's
very, very easy to do.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.490
And that's what it is so
wonderful about the

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:40.050
opportunity we all
have together.

00:39:43.208 --> 00:39:44.160
ALAN VIVERETTE: Yes?

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.740
AUDIENCE: So is this working?

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:49.000
My name is Guarang.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.220
And I've got a question.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:53.960
Is it possible to switch on
the accessibility features

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.890
without necessarily switching
on TalkBack?

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.440
Or rather, is it possible to
programmatically switch on

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.840
TalkBack within the app?

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.510
ALAN VIVERETTE: So let's see.

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:09.040
It is possible to use the
accessibility features without

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.100
TalkBack if you have an
accessibility service that is

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.390
not TalkBack.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.520
For example, BrailleBack.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.940
It is not currently possible
turn off speech output, but

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.980
you can always mute your phone
if you don't want it talking

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.080
while you have TalkBack
turned on.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.060
As we showed during the talk,
you can pause TalkBack--

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.930
actually let's switch back
to the device real quick.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:39.860
So you can pause TalkBack by
doing the down right and--

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.015
ANDROID: Pause feedback.

00:40:41.015 --> 00:40:42.930
ALAN VIVERETTE: --pausing
feedback, at which point

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.460
TalkBack is basically
turned off.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.100
And you can turn in back
on really quick.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.880
This is great if you're a
developer and you just need to

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:50.670
do quick testing, switch back to
having accessibility off to

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.240
figure out what's
wrong, go back.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.835
Does that answer
your question?

00:40:54.835 --> 00:40:58.640
AUDIENCE: Well, actually, what
I was asking is if I want

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.630
TalkBack-like features, but I
don't want my users to switch

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.790
on TalkBack all the time.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.720
ALAN VIVERETTE: I see.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.710
Yeah, that's a great candidate
for writing an accessibility

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.720
service, if you want some of
the features, maybe the

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.800
ability to read notifications
out loud as they're received.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.350
And we've seen a lot of great
applications that rely on the

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.970
accessibility framework.

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.250
I should mention TalkBack
is totally open source.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.280
So if you have any questions
about how something is

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.520
implemented in an accessibility
service, you can

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:26.790

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.940
CASEY BURKHARDT: BrailleBack
as well.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.047
ALAN VIVERETTE: And BrailleBack
back as well is

00:41:29.047 --> 00:41:30.180
open source.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.880
TV RAMAN: So to quick round off
that question, those of

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.090
you who are familiar with the
accessibility stack probably

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:38.440
already realize this.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.890
So Android accessibility
is layered.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.410
The framework has accessibility
APIs.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:47.390
It provides things like
accessibility actions, all of

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:49.440
which are covered in
previous talks.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.780
And then you write an
accessibility service that

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:53.670
never adjusts these.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:56.540
TalkBack is the one that
exercises pretty much every

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.340
corner of that API and
those services.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:04.920
But there's nothing sacrosanct
about TalkBack as the only

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.880
accessibility service.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.310
In fact, you actually have to
turn TalkBack on for it to be

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:11.040
active through the accessibility
setting.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.330
So as Alan said, you can
write TalkBack Lite.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.980
You can write TalkBack Deluxe.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.310
You can write TalkBack Lite
Lite, whatever, and get the

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.570
experience you want.

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.650
And that's how the framework
is created.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:27.000
So an accessibility service
has three aspects to it.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.880
One is querying what's on the
display, what's in the view

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.010
hierarchy, and getting a full
handle on the user interface.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.550
The other is providing feedback
to the user, using

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:40.560
whatever modality they
are using, be that

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.140
speech, be that Braille.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:46.760
And the third is translating
user's intent, such as button

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.820
process or whatever into
actions that the system

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.630
executes, which is what say a
one button interface would

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:53.542
[? divert ?].

00:42:53.542 --> 00:42:56.030
So for instance, if you're
building a one-button

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.250
interface for someone who can
see perfectly well, you

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.400
wouldn't actually leverage the
speech output capabilities or

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.590
the Braille output
capabilities.

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.110
You basically have
your one button

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.354
interface control the device.

00:43:07.354 --> 00:43:08.830
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.122
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.630
TV RAMAN: And one additional
point.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.940
Casey probably demoed
this during his--

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.390
but didn't say it
out explicitly.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:22.150
Because of the separation on
Android, you can actually run

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.940
TalkBack and screen
magnification simultaneously.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.280
So a low vision user who both
wants to see the screen

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.800
because he can see some and
wants speech output basically

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.630
doesn't have to make a choice
saying now I get speech or now

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.790
I get magnification.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.120
And the reason why we are
able to do this kinds of

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.770
combinations is because of this
layered architecture.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.870
CASEY BURKHARDT: If you'd like
to see a more in-depth demo

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.140
screen magnification, please
feel free to drop by the

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.100
accessibility sandbox.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.290
ALAN VIVERETTE: Your
question please?

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.400
AUDIENCE: My name
is [? Tonson ?].

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:57.490
And I have a question can Google
Play help their brand

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:05.126
man to find apps that has good
accessibility easily?

00:44:05.126 --> 00:44:07.010
TV RAMAN: That's a really
good request and we

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.840
will take that back.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.650
We've heard that many
times in the past.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:14.860
Today what we see users doing
is primarily wisdom of the

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.920
crowds, which has worked well.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.010
But I agree with you that it
would be really nice to be

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:25.600
able to find apps based on the
user's needs, not just for the

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.970
blind user, for instance, an app
that works very well for a

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.570
low vision user may not
necessarily work that well for

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.670
a blind user.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.540
And it would be nice for users
over time to be able to say

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:40.650
these are the types of things
I'm interested in terms of

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.230
user capabilities and find
apps that you like.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.530
So that's definitely a request
we'll take back the Play team.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:47.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.250
Thank you.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.700
ALAN VIVERETTE: All right.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.980
If that's all the questions,
we'll be at the accessibility

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.050
sandbox outside.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.470
Again, thank you everyone
for coming.

00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:58.580
TV RAMAN: Thank you for
coming, everyone.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.180
CASEY BURKHARDT: Thanks.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.640
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
