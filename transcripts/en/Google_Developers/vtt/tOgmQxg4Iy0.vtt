LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to
Google Developers Weekly

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.950
for December 9, 2013.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.830
I'm Louis Gray and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.720
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.831
and off.

00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.830
The big news from the
world of Google Developers

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.880
last week was the
general availability

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.720
of Google Compute Engine.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.880
Our Cloud Compute
service offers 99.95%

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.250
monthly SLA, 24 by
7 service, support

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.720
for additional flavors of Linux,
reduced prices, and much more.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.760
So you'll want to
check this out.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.810
Alongside the launch of
Google Compute Engine,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.260
Paul Rashidi debuted a
10-minute test drive here

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.910
on GDL-- walking us through the
process of creating a project,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.020
setting up a cloud-based
virtual machine,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.360
and installing a web
server-- very helpful.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.200
And maybe even fun.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.650
Our more grounded teammates
in Google Analytics,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.650
Andrew Wales and
Nick Mihailovski,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.580
told customers how to upgrade
to Universal Analytics

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.560
and answered some of the
many commonly asked questions

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.490
about the web's favorite
measurement tool.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.230
Every click counts.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.050
And don't we know it?

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.450
We were pleased to welcome back
Walleteers Peng Ying and Maru

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.190
Ahues Bouza.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.830
The pair walked through the
Wallet Objects API Quickstart

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.540
sample, setting you up
to connect your business

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.390
to millions of Google users,
showcasing your loyalty

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.610
programs, offers, and more.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.580
And Maps master Mano
Marks followed on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.670
with his first event in his new
location, soon to be revealed.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.030
This week's focus-- map padding
in the Google Maps SDK for iOS.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.210
Map padding allows you to change
the visible region of your map

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.070
so that your controls,
logo, and copyright notices

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.970
are all aligned with your view.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.340
From Milan, Sandro
Paganotti dives

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.350
into the promise of
HTML5 custom elements,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.100
helping us create new
HTML code elements that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.040
are reusable and readable.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.890
Even more challenging, he
does the entire presentation

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.810
in Italian.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.330
Incredible.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.350
Wrapping up our studio
events for last week

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.870
is the first in a series from
our Google Developer Experts

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.000
team and the YouTube
developers squad.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.040
Frequent GDL guest Jeremy Walker
talks with GDE Jarom McDonald

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.400
about the many contributions
that he and others

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.090
have made to the
YouTube API community.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.480
Watch for more interviews
in coming weeks here

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.490
on the Weekly Wrap Up.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.820
Around here, we think
fast is better than slow.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.300
And we're always working
to make the web faster.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.890
This week, web performance
guru, Ilya Grigorik,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.260
wrote about HTTP 2.0--
a developing protocol

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.440
that makes applications faster,
simpler and more robust.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.730
Read Ilya's article to
learn in great detail

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.960
how HTTP 2.0 will
speed up the web.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.270
Just go to acm.org and search
for "making the web faster."

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.510
We also love making
it faster and easier

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.490
for you to develop
great mobile apps.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.380
To help, Chrome
DevTools just got

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.300
a couple of wonderful
new features.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.190
First, when you're
remote debugging,

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.730
Screencast lets you see
your mobile device screen

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.920
right along your tools.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.390
And Mobile Emulation
lets you realistically

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.350
emulate many device
characteristics

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.960
on your desktop.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.380
Read all about it
at html5rocks.com.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.270
That's html5rocks.com.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.740
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the world
