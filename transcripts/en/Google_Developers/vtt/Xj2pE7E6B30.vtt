00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Welcome to "Google Developers
Weekly" for October 7, 2013.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.260
happening in the world
of Google Developers,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.270
on the set and off.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.400
As you know, social is a key
ingredient in today's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.560
applications.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.790
Getting social network
integration just right can

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.010
delight your users, but getting
it wrong could get a

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.065
big mistake.

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:24.590
Nazmul Idris and Don Dodge get
social and tell us just how to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.760
strike the right balance.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.430
Mano Marks put his location
marker in Mountain View and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.920
taught us how to get started
with the Google

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.780
Maps SDK for iOS.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.960
This quick tutorial guides
you on how to set up your

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.770
development environment, test
an API key, and create that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.460
first application.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.040
From Milan, Google Developer
expert Mauro Solcia explained

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.690
how to create your first app
that displays information from

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.610
files stored in Google Drive and
display them on a web page

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.470
using JavaScript.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.140
Back in Mountain View, Josh
Livni and Felipe Hoffa gave us

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.740
a glimpse into the future of
air travel using Google

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.120
BigQuery and the Google Maps
JavaScript API visualizing

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.500
correlations.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.650
And traveling to a place that
knows quite a bit about

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.950
clouds, not to mention rain, we
find ourselves at the first

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.390
event taped in our new
Seattle studio.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.190
Brian Dorsey provided us with a
quick introduction to Google

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.060
Compute Engine load balancing.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.340
Watch for many more clouds
in this space.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.950
From Tel Aviv, Ido Green showed
us the power of the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.940
Google Eclipse plug-in and how
you can push your code to App

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.330
Engine with only two clicks.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.310
And as we like to say,
live from New York.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.590
Ikai Lan debuted the new home
of YouTube API samples on

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.190
GitHub at GitHub.com/YouTube.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.960
The event walks through why we
made the move, our project

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.220
setup, and shows basic commands
and GUI tools to get

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.620
you up and running.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.520
From Buenos Aires, Nick
Bortolotti and his dog return

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.840
with "GDL LatAm" talking
App Engine.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.050
Watch Nick's talk and learn
about how the Focus Ninja can

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.330
make your projects better.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.010
Closing out the week in our
studios in Mountain View, we

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.350
hosted the MEAN stack
of MongoDB,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.080
Express, Node.JS and AngularJS.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.490
Google Engineering Director
Brad Green connected with

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.710
leaders from MongoDB, Breeze.js,
and StrongLoop to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.479
talk about making managing data
simpler, even in mobile

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.050
enterprise environments.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.990
And it wouldn't be a full report
if I didn't highlight

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.330
the fantastic work being done
by our teammates in Android

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.610
Developers Live.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.780
This week saw a new "Android
Design in Action," a new

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.587
"GameOn!" episode with Todd
Kerpleman, and a trio of

00:02:20.587 --> 00:02:22.480
DevBites aimed at improving
your applications

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.700
through best practices.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.292
Check out all their videos
at Developers.Googl

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:29.170
e.com/Live/Android.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.340
And news flash--

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.340
not everybody in the world
speaks English.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.770
Because of that, Google recently
worked with Udacity

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.960
to translate many of its web
application MOOCs into Spanish

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.610
and Brazilian Portuguese.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.930
Captioned versions of several
videos are now available.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.180
[SPANISH].

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.390
And this week we launched a
Google+ community for Cloud

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.650
Platform developers.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.970
We're looking for comments,
videos, questions and all

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.370
other kinds of content
in the new community.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.190
And what better place than the
cloud for a community about

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.360
developing in the cloud?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.430
For those of you building
sharing into your iOS

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.300
applications, we just enabled
you to upgrade the Google+

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.210
sharing experience
inside your apps.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.030
The Google+ iOS SDK now enables
you to use a native

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.770
share box including image
and video attachments.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.060
Best of all, this only requires
you to change a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.170
single line of source code.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.660
See the new Google+ iOS SDK for
this and other updates.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.630
And when it comes to memory
leaks, you hate them, we hate

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.040
them, your users hate them.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.590
In our mutual never-ending quest
for future memory leaks,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.860
we've released a new doc on
memory profiling for your

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.370
JavaScript apps.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.250
Read a little, and save
your own memory.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.780
And we were really in a
documenting mood this week.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.720
Over on the Google Maps
JavaScript API, we launched

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.270
new documents that show
you how to add

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.660
overlays to your maps.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.380
Check out the docs and sample
code to see how to put shapes,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.720
markers and info windows
on the map.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.120
And to make sure that you never
miss a thing from the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.550
world of Google Developers,
subscribe to Google Developers

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.370
on YouTube.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.830
And check out the GDL schedule
at developers.google.com/live.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.385
I'm Louis Gray, and I'll see
you back in the studio.
