00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:02.070
JONATHAN: to this week's
office hours.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.510
I'm joined by Wolff Dobson.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.080
My name is Jonathan Beri.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.070
And our guests today are Gerwin
and Sigfried, some guys

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.990
you may have seen before.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.660
Hey, guys.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.912
GERWIN: Hi.

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:17.820
SIEGFRIED: Hi.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.800
JONATHAN: So if you've been
following our blog, our Plus

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.750
pages, our own stream, you know
that we released Google+

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.980
[? ingrown ?] apps.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.962
GERWIN: Yay.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:30.272
JONATHAN: General--

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:31.995
Yes.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:35.460
But today's topic, we will be
talking about what we released

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.060
to developers, some new end
user features and any

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.770
questions that we have from
our guests, as well as the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.360
original announcement plus
those this morning.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.400
So if you have questions, and
you're watching live stream,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.420
go ahead and ask it there.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.010
Before we go into the technical
piece about the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.455
features being launched, we
will say that it's being

00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.630
released slowly over
the course today.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.270
So if you don't see anything in
apps in your hangouts yet,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.730
you will by the end
of the day.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.250
Cool, so let's start with
our new developer site.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.060
So we--

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.830
WOLFF: Well, actually, I think
we should start with apps.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.080
JONATHAN: Our apps.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.005
WOLFF: Our guests, have you
guys seen the new app

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:23.502
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
and everything.

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:25.270
SIEGFRIED: Not live yet.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.970
WOLFF: Not yet.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.540
Yeah, I noticed we don't
have it here.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.850
As Jonathan said, we're
rolling it out slowly.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.650
It's pretty neat.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.834
We've got [? topher ?]
on there.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:39.870
We've got some shared
collaboration

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.630
stuff like slide share.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.880
JONATHAN: Thank you.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.470
WOLFF: So yeah, a lot
of new partners.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.000
I really hope everybody has
a chance to play with it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.346
JONATHAN: Yes, there are
some photos in the

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:56.844
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:57.840
So you can see it.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.235
WOLFF: Yeah, so take a look.

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:00.780
Take a look under
[? the development tool. ?]

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.865
JONATHAN: So for the end user
features, we now have the

00:02:02.865 --> 00:02:08.910
ability to take from an app of
one of our feature partners to

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.140
go back to any recently used
apps, an ability to toggle on

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.593
and off apps and a new feature
which we added.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:18.510
It's called Extensions, and
we're going to go into that a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.630
little bit.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.780
WOLFF: We're going to talk
about what those are.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.370
JONATHAN: But those are
different ways to interact.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.972
And of course, the other
end user feature is the

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.400
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] button, which
we're going to go into how to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000
make and how to use in your
site a little later.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.761
So the general workflow is
somebody would like to use an

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:37.845
app, a hangout, and there's an
app in it, you can certainly

00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:38.940
use the application together.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.412
Or you can launch a hangout
button on your site and go

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:44.800
right to the app.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.930
WOLFF: We have examples of that
in the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.800
So first thing obviously,
we have some pictures of

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.180
collaborating together.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.220
We have a picture of the first
extension, which is the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.396
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] tab.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:04.010
But what I'd like to talk about
right now is one of the

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.160
big features is you
can now shift your

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.890
hangout apps from public.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.430
And we want to talk about
how you do that.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.930
So why don't you click on
Publishing Apps right now.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.750
Or should we start with--?

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.570
JONATHAN: Let's just
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.526
WOLFF: Well, click on Publishing
Apps to make sure I

00:03:24.526 --> 00:03:25.776
[INAUDIBLE] here.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.980
Yeah, let's just go
there [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.180
JONATHAN: Great.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.920
WOLFF: So if you go to--
so Create A New

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.220
Hangout App, please.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.470
JONATHAN: Hangout app.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.330
WOLFF: [INAUDIBLE] awesome.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.459
Then go ahead and throw in
hangouts, what you always do.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.350
Now, go click on Hangouts.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.160
And when you look into Hangouts,
you have a lot of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.890
new [? features. ?]

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.420
And you can see those
now, I believe.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.340
So of you scroll down a little
bit, the first section there

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.740
is just where [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.773
We [? do ?] you a section where
it shows you the title

00:04:18.773 --> 00:04:20.683
of your apps, and that's
the move here in the

00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:21.170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.730
It's also in the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.970
while you're loading.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.230
So take something nice
besides hangout app.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.140
Now, the next section there,
is your hangout

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.762
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] an extension?

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:33.900
And it goes into a little bit
more detail there, but it's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.400
basically an app that appears in
the leftmost 300 pixels of

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.390
your screen.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.430
So we've released a single
extension so far, which will

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.967
be the Fx app, which allows
you to have more elaborate

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:49.580
decorations.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.839
But the idea is that it's
for something for

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:58.840
[? trying out ?], people
cracking dice in a role

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.640
playing game.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.830
JONATHAN: Like a note-taking
app.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.755
WOLFF: Yeah, something
like that.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:05.590
It basically takes the place
where the testing

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.990
[? moment is. ?]

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.887
If you check extension and you
weren't in Dev console, it

00:05:09.887 --> 00:05:14.890
will look like a regular app
right now because we don't yet

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.290
have an extension pane
in the hangout.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.212
But it's OK, because once you
go public, it actually will

00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.720
appear in the extension place.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.900
JONATHAN: So that's actually
an important thing to note.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.283
Right now, the apps and the
extensions, from an API point

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:32.240
of view, are the same.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.800
And so all the APIs that you
have within an app, you have

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.700
within your extension.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.800
WOLFF: And the shared state--

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.030
if two people are running that
extension, that will be

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.140
sharing state.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.390
You can actually have two
apps running now.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.315
You can have the extension and
the regular app, and the

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:47.440
extension will share
a state with other

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.610
extensions of the same kind.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.131
So if two people are in the same
extension, they'll share

00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.140
a state together.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.060
JONATHAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.620
WOLFF: And the main page app
will have shared state with

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.920
your other main page apps of
the same types, but they do

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.570
not communicate with
each other.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.536
And in fact, you can't
even tell if one or

00:06:06.536 --> 00:06:07.980
the other is running.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.990
JONATHAN: Right.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.850
So to sum it up, you can
actually have a hangout

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.050
without an app, with an app,
with an extension, and with an

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.300
app and an extension.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.016
WOLFF: 0, 1, 11, and 0.

00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.720
JONATHAN: There are those
who can count in binary.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.350
WOLFF: And those who can't.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:26.370
JONATHAN: Something.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.794
WOLFF: There are ten
kinds of people.

00:06:27.794 --> 00:06:28.778
There's [? import binary ?]

00:06:28.778 --> 00:06:29.270
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.520
JONATHAN: That's it.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.840
WOLFF: OK, so anyway, like I
said, if you click that right

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.980
now, it'll tell the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] server that

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.560
you want to share this
as an extension.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.650
It will have no effect when
you're in what we're calling

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.070
developer sandbox, which is
[? hanging out with ?]

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.410
the API to talk [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.450
If you're running against
production, which is

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.540
+.google.com/hangouts, then it
will appear as an extension.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.843
However, you can't run it
against production unless you

00:07:02.843 --> 00:07:03.752
publish it.

00:07:03.752 --> 00:07:05.170
So let's talk about
publishing.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.450
JONATHAN: One more thing about
extensions before we move on.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.910
When you flip that bit, the only
thing that does change is

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.980
the size the icons that
are required.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.876
So if you notice that--

00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:17.150
if our machine would match up.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.590
There you go.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.750
It's a different size because
it's where we place the

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.210
extension launcher.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.910
WOLFF: Yeah, the extension
launcher is more on the top

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.140
bar where the little dog face
and everything were before,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.505
and then the apps actually
run in the base.

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:36.150
So yeah, Jonathan's
going to show you.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.670
JONATHAN: So this is a screen
shot of what it looks like.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.790
WOLFF: Give them
one more take.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.610
So if you look here next to
screen share, there's a little

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.530
icon there.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.640
That's what extensions are.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:51.813
When you click that, it's going
to show an extension.

00:07:51.813 --> 00:07:52.216
That's where the icon
is going to be.

00:07:52.216 --> 00:07:55.474
We do provide a default icon,
but it's not nearly as cool as

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:56.400
the icon you can pick out.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.670
So you should definitely
put your own icons up.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.570
And actually, go back and
show the apps up here.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.960
JONATHAN: Oh, yes.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.624
WOLFF: So if you go
down and look at--

00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:10.620
JONATHAN: Do we have a screen
shot of the App switcher?

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.402
WOLFF: Well anyway, in the
App switcher, you'll

00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:23.390
see this big grid.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.640
Probably,
[? you're not running that. ?]

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.640
Go down.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.140
Go down.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.640
Go down.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640
Go down.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.220
Nope.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.734
Sorry, it's in the
[? Public here. ?]

00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:34.700
This is my last offer.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.685
JONATHAN: Some of this was
written very recently.

00:08:37.685 --> 00:08:39.720
JONATHAN: Possibly
the last minute.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.330
So right, so scroll
up a little bit.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.910
That's a picture of the App
switcher right there.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.040
That's where your icons
are going to appear.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.255
It looks like the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] when you

00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:49.930
mouse over it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.060
And the thing goes up and
down to show your

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.360
description, very cool.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.900
JONATHAN: And this grid that
we actually mention here is

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.732
the selector, [? cursor ?]
feature and most

00:08:58.732 --> 00:08:59.850
recently used as well.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.660
We don't have a screen
shot for you.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.790
WOLFF: OK, so going back
to the console.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.900
So anyway, put URLs to
your icons there.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:13.218
If you put bogus URLs in,
then it will just put

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:14.340
the defaults there.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.190
So again, be cool.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:17.495
The black and white one
is for mouse down.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.940
Application description,
right.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.480
So the application description
will appear.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.240
If you've ever been to the
current web store, you have

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.980
those little squares.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:27.865
When you mouse over them, a
little white thing goes up and

00:09:27.865 --> 00:09:29.100
says, I want to use this app.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.700
And then there's a little
one-sentence description.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:37.065
Again, feel free to sell you
app in there, make it look

00:09:37.065 --> 00:09:39.320
like it's fun to use.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.540
JONATHAN: By selling, make
people want to install it.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.520
WOLFF: Yes, exactly.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.570
Then down in Support, you need
a terms of service you need a

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.188
privacy policy, and you
need some way for

00:09:53.188 --> 00:09:54.590
Google to contact you.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.740
JONATHAN: And these
are all URLs.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.220
Emails are not sufficient.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.190
And I think Gerwin had a
question before we started

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.300
about terms of service
and privacy policy.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.166
GERWIN: Yes.

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:09.020
JONATHAN: And so the best
answer I can give you is

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.296
because we can't provide Google
service, terms of

00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:17.010
service and privacy policy vary
from country to country.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.040
And also, depending on
the industry, how you

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.270
want to word that.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.780
So if you're going to publish
an app, you should have your

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.270
terms of service and privacy
policy reviewed by somebody

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.665
who will provide Google
authority for the countries

00:10:28.665 --> 00:10:29.365
you want to operate in.

00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:31.755
GERWIN: OK.

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:34.490
JONATHAN: Outside of that,
anything I say is just

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.800
conjecture and what I observe.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.970
Just make sure, especially on
the privacy policy, which I

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:44.580
care more about-- maybe less for
the legal-- is be upfront

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.410
with your users.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.410
So what you do with their data
is very important, and make

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.890
sure they know what you're
doing with their data.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.650
How legalese you want to make
it, that's really up to you

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.140
and your legalese.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.724
WOLFF: But you need to tell them
what you're going to do,

00:10:59.724 --> 00:11:03.186
and that's what we're
looking for.

00:11:03.186 --> 00:11:05.835
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE] contact,
we want [? a page. ?]

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:09.120
Hopefully, it'll have email or
a way to post or [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.050
JONATHAN: Even something as
simple as your + page-- if you

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.507
feel that's the right way for
them to contact you-- if we

00:11:13.507 --> 00:11:16.881
create a + page for you app,
that could be sufficient.

00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:20.360
JONATHAN: Make a + page
for your app.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.850
Lastly, you have this
check box here,

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.440
which is Make Public.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.750
And Make Public says make
your application

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.800
available to all users.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.840
If this box is unchecked, it's
going to work the way it has

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.590
worked in Developer
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] until now,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.332
which is only people who are
in your Teams list--

00:11:38.332 --> 00:11:39.650
up there on the left--

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.970
only people on your Teams list
are going to be able to see

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.070
the app at all.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.740
They are the only people who
know that it exists.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.910
If you try to bring somebody
in, they won't be able to

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.590
install it.

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.570
If you click Make Public,
everybody in the world, if

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.150
they have your product ID, which
is that number up in the

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.660
thing, if they have their
product ID, they'll

00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.930
be able to run it.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.570
And keep that in mind.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.650
We ask you to make two steps.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.950
The first is that you make
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.340
ID because as you will notice
when you are running outside

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.590
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.913
actually, if you've created an
[? planet ID ?] for your app,

00:12:20.913 --> 00:12:23.810
Google will now ask you, when
you begin running the app, for

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.680
permission.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.730
Actually, a permission
box pops up before

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.210
the app begins running.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.160
And it asks for exactly
three strokes.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.430
There are two hangout strokes
that are basically--

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.550
this app may or may not
use your camera.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.240
One of them is Plus Me.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.530
Google needs to know
who you are.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.570
Or rather, the app is going
to know who you are.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.830
And the last one is
more [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.555
JONATHAN: Yes, that's correct.

00:12:56.555 --> 00:12:59.500
WOLFF: So anyway, it'll
ask for these strokes.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.350
Those three strokes actually
mean that you are now

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.155
authenticated, which means if
you used the authentication

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:07.650
sample that I [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
a while back, which is now

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.510
[INAUDIBLE], you'll be able to
get a token without actually

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.330
popping up a box, which
is pretty neat.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.406
JONATHAN: So that means that
the JavaScript client, the

00:13:16.406 --> 00:13:19.595
Google API JavaScript client,
which is in alpha still, you

00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:22.870
can actually use that within
a hangout to call [? OA ?]

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.765
endpoints for all
the Google APIs.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.724
WOLFF: You can get a [? OA2 ?]
client access hookup.

00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:34.380
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:34.980
And that's big.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.122
That means that it's built
into the apps.

00:13:41.645 --> 00:13:46.380
It's making upfront to the user
what you're going to be

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.460
doing in your app.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.120
It's pretty cool.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.640
JONATHAN: That's the first
requirement form.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.040
WOLFF: First step is that
you go and you click

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:53.932
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:13:53.932 --> 00:13:56.865
GERWIN: Yeah, so can I ask
just a short question?

00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:57.280
WOLFF: Sure.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.600
GERWIN: So usually, when you
make a client, you have to

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.950
provide the callback URL and
admit its sources for the

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:04.570
JavaScript.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.720
Is there something special you
have to take care of when you

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.750
want to use the client ID for
the hangout apps, or do you

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.260
take care of this yourself?

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.390
WOLFF: That's a great
question.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.780
I'll repeat it.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.690
So the question is, what's a
callback URL for a client ID

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.670
that's running inside
a hangout?

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:22.516
Is that right?

00:14:22.516 --> 00:14:23.483
GERWIN: Yes, exactly.

00:14:23.483 --> 00:14:26.850
WOLFF: And the answer is, you
don't have to fill that out.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.810
GERWIN: OK.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.000
WOLFF: You can just leave it
as example.com, as long as

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.910
you're running it at hangout.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.110
And the reason for
that is because--

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:36.230
well, it's long-winded--

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.210
but basically, the gadget server
knows that you are

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.690
running the authenticated
service inside this I-frame

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.100
and will take care of the
redirect for you.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.880
GERWIN: OK, perfect.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.640
WOLFF: It's also why you, as
we'll discover in the Docs,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.180
actually don't need to send in
your APIP because again, the

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.530
gadget server and the RPC
services will re-write your

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.410
client ID because it knows
exactly who you are because

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.440
you're already [? authorized. ?]

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.300
We know who you are.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.406
JONATHAN: By doing the
rewriting, we can keep it

00:15:05.406 --> 00:15:07.516
secure without--

00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:10.145
WOLFF: Yes, it means people
again aren't reading your

00:15:10.145 --> 00:15:10.967
client ID off your page.

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:12.210
JONATHAN: Exactly.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.190
WOLFF: It's win.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.595
So again, that's all
you have to do.

00:15:14.595 --> 00:15:16.380
You just have to type in your
project name and that's what's

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:17.520
going to appear in the pop-up.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.236
And you can provide your
pictures and stuff if you go

00:15:21.236 --> 00:15:23.326
back-- oh, you missed
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:24.110
Oh, there we go.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.180
Right, if you put your product
logo and your product name,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.320
then that's what's going to
pop up in the in the OAuth

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.550
dialogue, but all you
really have to do is

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.480
have a produce table.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.140
I mean we encourage product
logos, but cool.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.240
And then here, just pick
Web Application and hit

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:42.920
[? Great Plan ID. ?]

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.210
You don't have to worry about
the redirect URI or the

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.532
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:15:46.532 --> 00:15:48.480
GERWIN: OK perfect.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.900
WOLFF: Then go back.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.980
So now, he's created
a client ID.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:53.550
Last thin you have to do--

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.490
and this guy has already
done it.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.740
Last thing we ask, if you're
going to make an app public,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:05.262
we want you to register as a
Chrome Web Store developer

00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:07.490
JONATHAN: And so you only
have to do this once.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.970
WOLFF: Yes, only once, and you
actually don't have to upload

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.475
anything directly to the
Chrome web store.

00:16:11.475 --> 00:16:12.960
All we ask is that you

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.270
register as a Chrome developer.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.012
JONATHAN: And if you've
registered in the past, you

00:16:17.012 --> 00:16:18.640
don't have to register again.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:18.840
WOLFF: Yes.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.190
If you've already verified,
you're verified.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:20.920
It's fine.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.570
What we need you to do, there's
a link off the page in

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.710
the cases where you
do have it.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.500
Follow that link.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500
Say yes, I want to sign up.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.740
Then go to this dashboard page,
and if you've never

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.026
verified before, the
verification is a $5 fee.

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:35.860
JONATHAN: I think in
most countries.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.420
WOLFF: At least in the
United States.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.380
In Mountain View, it's $5, which
is just a one time fee

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.470
to make sure that you are who
you say you are, more or less.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.750
And after that, you
can publish as

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.390
many apps as you want.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.630
And only one developer on your
team needs to be a Chrome web

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.940
store-verified person.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.066
And to emphasize again, you
only need to be a verified

00:17:02.066 --> 00:17:03.970
Chrome developer if you
plan to go public.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:04.796
JONATHAN: Yes.

00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:07.440
WOLFF: If you don't want to go
public, don't need to do it.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.849
JONATHAN: So if you're a
university student, and you're

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.440
working on this for a project,
you may not have to even worry

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.390
about the--

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.630
WOLFF: Yes, you won't have to
worry about that unless you

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:16.800
want to make it public.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.680
If you're just doing a demo or
a hackathon, that's fine.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.755
So after that, hit Save, and
then, you will get a--

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.430
JONATHAN: I don't have
any content.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:29.120
WOLFF: You don't have an HML.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.025
And then you'll get your Enter
Hangout [? lid. ?]

00:17:32.025 --> 00:17:33.486
Now go back.

00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:35.200
Do you have an app
open on there?

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.910
[INAUDIBLE].

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:39.450
JONATHAN: Oh yeah, I do.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.500
WOLFF: Yeah, just get it back.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.380
And I'm going to talk a little
bit about that URL because

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.370
this is also exciting.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.310
So if you look, that Enter
Hangout [? lid ?]

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:54.490
links to Hangouts API, to [?
hangoutsapi.bandit.google.com

00:17:54.490 --> 00:18:00.640
?] or something a
lot like that.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.100
And that goes to the
sandbox server.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.900
And we talked about
this before.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:12.210
The production server is
plus.google.com/hangouts.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.660
Even after you make it public,
this will still go to the

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.720
development server.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.996
You have to construct the URL
yourself to get to the--

00:18:19.996 --> 00:18:20.960
JONATHAN: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.730
WOLFF: Right.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.476
And then can you show
an example of the--

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.190
well, we'll do it on
the other page.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.230
So great.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.120
So there you go.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.540
So that's what you need to know

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.306
about the new Dev console.

00:18:32.306 --> 00:18:36.010
If you get invalid input, which
will appear at the top

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.650
if you get some of your stuff
wrong, which means that some

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.990
of your fields aren't exactly
the way it was in [? Forms. ?]

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.520
Also, one last thing.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.870
Let's say you have an app that's
public, and you don't

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.510
want it to be public anymore.

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:57.470
Anybody who has ownership
rights may unclick that

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.110
rights, whether or not
they're a registered,

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.690
verified Chrome developer.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.650
However, only registered Chrome
developers can make it

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.920
back public again.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.490
JONATHAN: So some of the reasons
why you'd want to

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.220
remove the public feature
of your app.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.280
If there's an issue, and it's
affecting all users, and you

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.960
can't push it live is a reason
you would take it down.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.530
This is one reason.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.970
If there's some content issue
or issues such as user

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.150
complaints, you'd want to
take that down as well.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.600
So take advantage of that
feature in those instances.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.929
WOLFF: Or you just
want to retool.

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:32.150
You have a more awesome idea.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.700
Then the last thing is about--

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.780
shoot, I can't remember where
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:48.100
Oh, right, and as usually, if
you try to go to a hangout

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.936
app, and it's not public, and
you aren't a member of that

00:19:50.936 --> 00:19:53.380
team on production--

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.380
if you go to a hangout app on
production that's not public,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.630
it just won't let you.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.420
And you'll just be in
a regular hangout.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:01.600
JONATHAN: This is true.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.870
WOLFF: Now you know.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.853
JONATHAN: So we went over--

00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:06.460
WOLFF: The new Dev console.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.425
JONATHAN: We went over the new
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] or end users

00:20:08.425 --> 00:20:11.132
the new Dev console.

00:20:11.132 --> 00:20:15.790
WOLFF: Also to talk about is--

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.790
JONATHAN: We talked about
[? OA ?] a little bit.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.426
WOLFF: Yeah.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:19.794
We basically went through--

00:20:19.794 --> 00:20:21.080
oh, let's talk about
extensions.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:21.740
JONATHAN: Oh, extensions,
great.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.070
WOLFF: So, going to
the sample apps.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.730
JONATHAN: Sample apps.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.470
WOLFF: OK, so actually, I'm
going to interrupt and talk

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.020
about buttons for
just a second.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.610
You notice on this page,
we now have this

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.390
cool red hangout button?

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.276
That--

00:20:37.276 --> 00:20:39.946
hello, Gerwin, again.

00:20:39.946 --> 00:20:43.360
That hangout, that button
is a link to

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.620
plus.google.com out here.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.830
Let's go to buttons
real quick.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.085
I need a button.

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:53.582
No, it's right there.

00:20:53.582 --> 00:20:55.080
JONATHAN: Oh, sorry.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.060
Maybe you should have
pushed the button.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:02.575
WOLFF: Right, so we need your
app ID, which you get off of

00:21:02.575 --> 00:21:03.645
the Dev console.

00:21:03.645 --> 00:21:04.893
It's in the URL.

00:21:04.893 --> 00:21:06.160
It's the Project
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.910
12 or 13 or 14, whatever
it is.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.130
And basically, all you need
to do is attach it to

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.811
hangouts.api.tal
kgadget.google.com/hangouts.

00:21:16.811 --> 00:21:19.500
That's going to go to
the sandbox server.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.230
And when you want to
release, you go to

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.568
plus.google.com/hangouts.

00:21:23.568 --> 00:21:28.730
We give you example buttons
in four exciting sizes.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.000
We absolutely encourage
you to use these.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.205
The images themselves are served
off of plus.google.com,

00:21:35.205 --> 00:21:37.710
so they're actually
[INAUDIBLE].

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.920
JONATHAN: Yeah, so if there's
ever a change or an issue,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.145
that's the best way to get
the up to date button.

00:21:43.145 --> 00:21:45.550
And also, we serve it off
of RCBN so it's faster.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.160
WOLFF: It's going to
be super fast.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.780
JONATHAN: Also if you notice,
some of the dimensions

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.060
height-wise line up with
some of our other

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.368
buttons and the badges.

00:21:54.368 --> 00:21:55.742
So we can line them up.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.620
WOLFF: So anyway, going back
to the sample apps.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.770
So that's how you
make a button.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.300
Please make buttons in
the sample apps.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.610
So these are our sample
apps we have

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.120
previous to this launch.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.120
However, if you go into simple
hangout app, that one is a new

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.062
one that I made, which is as
small a hangout app as I could

00:22:18.062 --> 00:22:20.600
possibly make that still
did something.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.440
JONATHAN: Want to view the
source real quickly?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:23.850
WOLFF: Sure.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.980
Go to simple hangout app.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.830
There's not much to it.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.540
We're going to go down,
and basically

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.850
there's some styling.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.510
And there's a button, and
there's a thing that when you

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.360
press the button, it tells
you who's in the hangout.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.192
It's not super exciting.

00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:44.160
Oh shoot, we can't
run this because

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.206
you're running a hangout.

00:22:45.206 --> 00:22:47.390
JONATHAN: Yes, we can't
run it [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.990
WOLFF: Ah, curses.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:53.684
So darn, that ruins my
showing an exception.

00:22:53.684 --> 00:22:55.440
JONATHAN: Isn't there
a screen shot?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.200
WOLFF: Well, it's cool.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.650
JONATHAN: OK.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.028
WOLFF: There's a screen shot
in the docs, but people can

00:22:59.028 --> 00:22:59.760
look that up.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.610
So anyway, that is presented
as an extension.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.920
However, if you download it
and serve it yourself and

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.130
don't check the extension box,
it will show up a main app.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.090
JONATHAN: Yeah, so a good tip.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.130
All the sample apps that
we have hosted

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.250
under a gadget XML--

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.450
in the past and moving
forward--

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.850
you can actually just take that
and pass it into a new

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.750
project, a new hangout app.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.940
So you can just run
it and test it.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.770
It's really good if you're
trying to show somebody really

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.750
quickly and you don't
have an app made.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.260
And it's also a great way
to test without hosting.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.715
WOLFF: It's also a great way to
test that you are correctly

00:23:29.715 --> 00:23:33.660
starting a hangout if you're
having private connection

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.590
issues or something like that.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.250
Wait, is my app broken,
or am I just

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.570
having connection problems?

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:42.426
So that's a great thing to do.

00:23:42.426 --> 00:23:45.640
It's also just fun
to play with.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.090
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:49.790
OK, we talked about OA.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.120
Can you go into Fact
real quickly?

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.980
JONATHAN: Yes.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.210
WOLFF: We talked a little bit
about how do I get an access

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.150
to open, and do I have a link
to a hangout experiment that

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.586
will allow you to get an open.

00:24:03.586 --> 00:24:05.150
That is experimental.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.436
It's experimental for a number
of reasons, including that the

00:24:07.436 --> 00:24:09.430
JSAPI is still in alpha.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.170
JONATHAN: Yes.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.450
WOLFF: But we do encourage you
to use it and tell us how it's

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.185
working for you.

00:24:14.185 --> 00:24:16.320
JONATHAN: And I believe some
of the initial apps there

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.422
Are actually using
that JS client.

00:24:19.422 --> 00:24:19.864
So it is working.

00:24:19.864 --> 00:24:22.520
It works well.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.275
Just since you brought up the
Facts, we just started this

00:24:25.275 --> 00:24:29.340
new Facts section for issues
that come up in Office Hours

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:29.970
and the forum.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.250
So we might be adding more
and more really relevant

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:34.770
questions to this.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:39.980
WOLFF: And actually brings us
to one of the new features.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.160
We didn't--

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.206
JONATHAN: It's my favorite.

00:24:41.206 --> 00:24:43.014
Aside from Launch, it's
my favorite feature.

00:24:43.014 --> 00:24:44.310
WOLFF: Besides Launch, your
favorite feature.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:51.170
If you're working with
media overlays.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.214
So you're doing the
face tracking.

00:24:53.214 --> 00:24:56.200
Can you make yourself a dog?

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.580
JONATHAN: Can I do dogs?

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.140
WOLFF: Wait, no.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.750
You would have to
make us a dog.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.580
If you're doing face tracking,
if you're doing overlays, up

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.400
until this--

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.280
[LAUGHS].

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.530
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.500
[? If you ever wanted to ?]
exhibiting being animals,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:18.430
which is adorable, up until this
point, you have only been

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:23.776
able to do HTTP requests to get
those off of the server.

00:25:23.776 --> 00:25:28.390
Now, you can actually
use a data URI.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.950
JONATHAN: Yes.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.880
WOLFF: We have an example of
the data URI, with the

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.260
smallest data URI I could find
that would still be coherent.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:36.560
Follow that link.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.624
It's so exciting.

00:25:37.624 --> 00:25:40.326
I'm so proud of it.

00:25:40.326 --> 00:25:43.700
It is a little tiny
green spot.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.050
But anyway, that's an example.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.610
But it can be really useful if
you're drawing something in a

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.760
canvas, and you want to rig it
up as an extension, or you're

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.010
having somebody recording
audio--

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.935
or downloading audio
and playing it--

00:25:59.935 --> 00:26:01.580
and then you want to
just pull it off.

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.516
JONATHAN: Or if you just want
to reduce image size and not

00:26:02.516 --> 00:26:03.914
actually have to download
images.

00:26:03.914 --> 00:26:05.760
WOLFF: Yes.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.440
JONATHAN: Pretty exciting.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.290
WOLFF: Yeah, that's
really cool.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.230
The demo that we did for South
by Southwest, where you draw

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.620
on your face and then it appears
on your thing, I

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.956
actually did that to a server
where I actually uploaded and

00:26:16.956 --> 00:26:17.175
downloaded it.

00:26:17.175 --> 00:26:20.720
Now, I can get rid of that stuff
and just make it so it

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.750
goes directly to your browser
in your feed.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.590
JONATHAN: This opens
up a lot more

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.480
possibilities with [? data ?]

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:28.830
overlays.

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.830
WOLFF: Yeah, really
excited about what

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.833
people can do with overlays.

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:37.700
The other thing that we added,
which also concerns overlays--

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.903
and actually, this one is only
for people who have the

00:26:41.903 --> 00:26:43.540
plug-in version 2.8 and above.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:44.950
JONATHAN: 2.8.5 actually.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.830
WOLFF: 2.8.5 and above.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.790
Is that you can have multiple
overlays on.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.780
So under the old scheme--

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.450
Gerwin's eyes lit up.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.900
Under the old scheme,
you could only

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.700
have a single overlay.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:01.620
Or if you played a sound through
that hangout, then it

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.295
would only play one.

00:27:02.295 --> 00:27:04.200
It would cancel all your
other overlays.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.440
Now, we support multiple
overlays.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.090
I believe 2.8.5 is out
for Windows and Mac.

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:12.670
JONATHAN: That's correct.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.950
Most Chrome users should
have that already.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.800
It's also [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
off their Firefox.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.260
WOLFF: Yeah, so way cool.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:27.235
And in fact, our new Fx apps
extension that's going to be

00:27:27.235 --> 00:27:30.880
in the app actually does have as
many overlays as you want.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.915
JONATHAN: And the Fx app, it's
the cat dog overlay to the

00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:37.701
next level, plus plus.

00:27:37.701 --> 00:27:39.192
WOLFF: Yeah, plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.245
JONATHAN: So for users, if you
require the multiple overlays,

00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:49.686
they'll be prompted
to upgrade, and it

00:27:49.686 --> 00:27:51.700
should be going out.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.860
[INAUDIBLE] there's
a way to check.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.580
If your users complain about not
having it, they can got to

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.178
WOLFF: And figure out whether
they've got the

00:27:59.178 --> 00:27:59.822
right one or not.

00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:01.072
JONATHAN: And [? debug. ?]

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.690
What else did we want
to cover today?

00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:12.080
WOLFF: Actually, that's
all the new

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.445
features, which was a lot.

00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:17.180
JONATHAN: It was like
a whirlwind.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.280
WOLFF: A whirlwind tour.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.154
We work right next
to each other.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.080
JONATHAN: So I think first, I
want to start with Gerwin and

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:26.730
Siegfried if they have
any questions.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.920
I know Gerwin already asked one,
but please let us know.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.742
GERWIN: Actually, all my
questions have been answered.

00:28:32.742 --> 00:28:34.525
Now, I'm going to have to play
with the new things, and there

00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:36.900
will be more questions maybe.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.020
JONATHAN: Awesome.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.000
So we're expecting
a Hangout Disco?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.700
WOLFF: Hangout Disco.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.160
GERWIN: Yes.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.310
JONATHAN: Awesome.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.300
SIEGFRIED: I'm working on
the homepage already.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.540
WOLFF: I hope you're
using new button.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.650
JONATHAN: So Gerwin, I
haven't you seen you

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.190
go in Hangout Disco.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.380
WOLFF: Well, now they'll
have the opportunity.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.200
You can [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.940
JONATHAN: It's exactly
what it sounds like.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.640
WOLFF: It is a disco
in a hangout.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.940
SIEGFRIED: In 3-D.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.540
WOLFF: I also strongly
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:01.950
JONATHAN: Yes, Web GL.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.280
Siegfried, any questions
from you?

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.050
SIEGFRIED: Yeah, I'm
waiting for updates

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.885
for the regular API.

00:29:10.885 --> 00:29:17.560
I haven't tried hangouts yet,
but I will do it now, I think.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.480
And yeah, I'm still playing with
the regular API, doing

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.100
some stuff with it.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:28.330
And I'm waiting for [? access ?]
for more streams

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:35.720
and more not so public items
on the regular posts.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.450
JONATHAN: Right, actually, I
saw your post. That's great

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.960
feedback, and Marie
communicated that.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.260
And the answer for the general
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.490
API status is we're still
working on things.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.325
And we don't have any
comment of when they

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:51.150
release, but we're--

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.110
WOLFF: Hey guys, we are not
close enough to the

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.325
microphones.

00:29:57.325 --> 00:29:58.050
How are we doing?

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.430
Is this better?

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.680
JONATHAN: OK.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.195
So we're going to up to the post
and see if there are any

00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:08.445
questions that we can answer.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.950
WOLFF: Actually, I'm looking
at the post right now, and

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:17.700
pretty much, there's
been a lot of,

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.370
yay, which is wonderful.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:21.730
And complaining that--

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:22.730
you know what it is?

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.130
It's your fan being
picked up by the--

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.000
JONATHAN: Oh.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.250
WOLFF: It's so noisy.

00:30:34.514 --> 00:30:36.378
JONATHAN: I'm actually
going to drop out.

00:30:36.378 --> 00:30:39.810
WOLFF: Yeah, why don't you
close your thing there.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.300
Oh, create topic and
hangout title.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.680
You're still able to set
the hangout title.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.500
When you click on the Hangout
button, users get the ability

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.410
to set their topic.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.610
Asking for I'd like
to set the topic--

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.300
JONATHAN: Programtically?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.860
WOLFF: Programatically,
that's a cool idea.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:07.650
That's cool.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.950
We should look into that.

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.501
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:31:12.501 --> 00:31:16.920
Actually questions have
been pretty much--

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.445
JONATHAN: I'm looking through
the original posting.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.930
SIEGFRIED: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.940
Can I just ask another
question?

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:33.640
I had always had the problem of
getting the right time of

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.266
the hangout because you're
announcing it in your time,

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:42.640
and I'm seeing it in my time
because I live in Germany.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.900
So we have a difference of
eight or nine hours.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.450
And it would be very cool if
there is a future in the

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:54.890
posting that you can surround
date and time with some

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.490
special characters and
they get converted

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.976
to the local time.

00:31:58.976 --> 00:32:00.810
JONATHAN: Yeah, We
would be cool.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.764
So that would be more of a
general product feature.

00:32:04.764 --> 00:32:06.710
SIEGFRIED: Yeah.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.170
WOLFF: Yeah, that's
a good idea.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.350
JONATHAN: Like a macro
script kind of thing?

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.290
WOLFF: Or are you talking more
about having the locale

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.840
included with the post?

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.800
JONATHAN: No, I think the idea,
which is pretty cool, is

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.590
something that you would see in
a CNS system where you just

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:26.235
put time, and it would convert
it for each client for their

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:27.690
local time.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:34.020
If I did 11:30 PST, it would
go to the German time zone

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.444
automatically.

00:32:35.444 --> 00:32:37.810
It's a cool idea.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:41.720
We'll definitely send
that back up.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.180
So any more questions
from the stream?

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.964
WOLFF: No, I think we're
actually doing pretty well.

00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:48.080
We're really excited to see what
kinds of things you guys

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.110
are building, and we would
absolutely love it if you sent

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.390
us public apps that
we can play with.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:55.780
JONATHAN: Yeah, especially
on our plus pages.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.050
We're start [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
them.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.286
And back just to review, when
you're ready to go live, you

00:33:03.286 --> 00:33:04.102
publish that app.

00:33:04.102 --> 00:33:07.430
You can host the link inside
Google+ or any other social

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.140
media tool directly.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.040
Of course, you could also use
the button and put it on the

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.580
site or anywhere that
hosts the HTML.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.450
WOLFF: Some kind of
loading page.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.120
JONATHAN: And yeah, that's how
you get your app around.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.710
And one somebody uses your app,
they don't necessarily

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.770
have to go searching back for
that app again because we

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.720
service that in the Recently
Used tab inside the app.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:28.800
WOLFF: Yeah, Recently Used.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.490
Extensions do not appear
in Recently Used.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.410
Extensions are, again,
designed to be more

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:38.830
personalized apps, so
do be aware of that.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.120
JONATHAN: Of course, we have
our feedback channels.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.720
So we have our Issue Tracker for
general Google= stuff, and

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.480
that's the best place to surface
issues with that

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.600
hangouts API or the
apps in general.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.750
We have our forums
or questions and

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.025
answers type of posting.

00:33:57.025 --> 00:33:59.700
And of course, you can follow
us at Google+ and ask us

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.420
questions directly there.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.720
And I think we're waiting now
for you guys to make some

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.880
awesome apps.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.139
SIEGFRIED: Concerning the
hangout button, is it possible

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.050
to share someone else's
hangout buttons?

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.610
For example, if Gerwin was
publishing his hangout and the

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:22.400
button, can I use that hangout
button on my site also.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.639
JONATHAN: Yes, once an app is
published publicly, then it's

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:29.830
just a URL with--

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:30.790
WOLFF: It's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:33.060
question mark, VID equals the
name of your product.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:33.350
SIEGFRIED: OK.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:35.150
JONATHAN: So anybody can
show that around.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.389
So you can email that.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:40.420
WOLFF: You can post
a gallery of apps,

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.520
whatever you want to do.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:45.679
We'd love to see stuff
like that.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:46.100
SIEGFRIED: Cool.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.250
JONATHAN: So we want to create
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] on it, right?

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.030
And you can also generate
those links

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.690
dynamically, right?

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.122
Because if you have a series
of GIDs, you can

00:34:56.122 --> 00:34:57.285
just spit them out.

00:34:57.285 --> 00:34:57.750
WOLFF: Yes.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.455
But yest, please, feel free
to use our graphics.

00:35:00.455 --> 00:35:00.930
JONATHAN: Great.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.990
Well, I want to thank
Gerwin and Siegfried

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.290
for joining us today.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:10.040
Thanks for all the questions
and hanging out with us.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.050
Till next time, I guess.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:12.844
WOLFF: Yeah, we'll see
you next week.

00:35:12.844 --> 00:35:14.290
JONATHAN: Thanks, guys.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.680
WOLFF: Thanks all.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.930
SIEGFRIED: Bye.
