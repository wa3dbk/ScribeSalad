PAUL IRISH: We have Tom
Wiltzius and Nat Duca.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.470
They are on the Chrome
Graphics team and hack all day

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.630
on the graphic stack.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.061
They're dedicated to making
you as a developer understand

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.560
what's going on so that you can
make sure that your apps are

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.500
fast, fluid, and awesome and
then simultaneously dedicated

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.290
to improving that platform
so that you don't have

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.200
to work so hard to do that,
and you just get it for free.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.410
I'm really excited, and
please put your hands together

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.188
for Nat and Tom.

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:34.544
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.590
TOM WILTZIUS: Hello, everyone.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.580
My name's Tom
Wiltzius, as Paul said.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.350
NAT DUCA: I'm Nat Duca.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.880
Nice to see everybody here.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.671
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:47.550
And we're from the
Chrome Graphics team.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.470
I'm going to use the laptop
instead of the clicker

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.250
so we can play videos.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.811
We're here today to talk
about rendering performance.

00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.560
And we want to start
off with a few basics

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.435
that we're not going to
cover in much detail,

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:02.590
because there is a ton of great
content available on the web

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.000
about this stuff already.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.310
We've talked about it before.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.220
Other folks on our
Developer Relations team

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.720
have talked about it before.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.391
But we want to make sure
we're all on the same page.

00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.390
NAT DUCA: So the pages
that we want you to be on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.260
are the following, right?

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.630
You got the screens
here, lots of them.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.350
They're all running at about
60 hertz, but maybe not.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.300
16 milliseconds is a number that
you want to keep in your mind.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.540
We heard [? Elia ?] talking
about numbers much bigger

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.527
than 16 milliseconds, so this
is a much smaller time frame.

00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:34.110
But it's super, super important
that if you want to be smooth,

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.510
you've got to hit that budget.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.810
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.200
And there's a lot
of stuff that needs

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.540
to go into that 16 milliseconds.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.520
The rendering system's
really complicated.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.210
We're going to walk through the
various stages in the rendering

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.900
pipeline in this talk.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.330
But it's challenging
to fit everything

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.790
into 16 milliseconds.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.100
And this means that
you should be working

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.367
with the browser
whenever possible.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:55.450
This means using things
like requestAnimationFrame

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.420
rather than a timer
to run animations.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.480
This means using things like
CSS animations, when possible,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.240
rather than doing everything
yourself in JavaScript.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.609
And yeah, just
trying to play nice.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:08.650
NAT DUCA: Please be nice.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.483
TOM WILTZIUS: There's
more content available

00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:11.393
at those links.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:12.080
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.940
So we all know, and we've
known for many years,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.460
that if you have good
load times for your pages,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.110
your user engagement will
be much better than if you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.259
have bad load times.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.800
There's another part
of this business

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.258
that we don't talk
about but that's

00:02:25.258 --> 00:02:28.700
obvious to mobile developers,
which is your responsiveness,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.480
right?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.510
We've got two videos
here going that are

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.907
a good responsive page that is
smooth, and one that's janky.

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:37.740
You've got to think of
this as a first order

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.070
part of your business
as creating a web app.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.340
I think most of you know this.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.540
But it's really worth hammering
that home up to the bosses

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.540
that this is something
you don't fix at the end,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.406
you think about
throughout the life cycle

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:49.030
of whatever it is
that you're building.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.155
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:54.650
And especially, we're going to
talk a lot today about things

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.450
that impact mobile
devices more than they

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.460
impact, say, this laptop.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.560
And this kind of
difference, this difference

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.020
in responsiveness,
the difference

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.912
comes out much more on
said mobile devices, right?

00:03:07.912 --> 00:03:09.370
This is one of the
key distinctions

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.120
between native
application development

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.670
platforms on Android or
iOS and the mobile web

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.390
is that things feel webby when
they lag, when they're slow,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.430
when they're jittery.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.350
And your users are going to
notice the difference, even

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.641
if they're not conscious of it.

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.100
It doesn't feel as nice.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.150
It's one of the tells, so
to speak, of a web app.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.840
And that's unfortunate, and
that's what we want to avoid.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.550
NAT DUCA: So we've been nice.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.660
And now let's talk tech.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.784
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:37.340
So if any of you have
seen us talk before,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.270
we're going to go
through some content that

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.430
should be fairly familiar about
how the painting system works,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.030
how the compositing
system works.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.960
And then we're going to
talk about some stuff

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.730
that we haven't
talked about before.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.340
So with that in mind, we're
going to kind of fast,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.720
but bear with us.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.360
If you think about
how pixels get

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.720
on the screen of,
say, a mobile phone,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940
there's a whole slew of
stuff that needs to happen.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.430
From the perspective
of JavaScript,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.600
it's all of this stuff.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.225
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:07.002
So this sort of thing makes
the actual Chrome engineers

00:04:07.002 --> 00:04:08.960
try to kill themselves,
because it's all a lie.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.820
But from the point of
view of the web developer,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.510
there are these
various pipeline stages

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.020
that your content goes through.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.000
You start off with
your JS and your DOM.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.279
It has to be styled.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.130
That has sort of two big
steps-- layout and recalc style.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.640
The first part is where you're
taking all your CSS selectors

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.230
and figuring out
which apply to what.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.870
Second part is figuring out
where things are positionally.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.620
Eventually you've got
all that stuff done.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.536
You're still not done.

00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:33.950
You've got to basically take
all of that computed stuff

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.110
and turn it in to actual pixels,
RGB values, in memory somewhere

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.240
or on a GPU.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.200
And we do that in
two parts right now.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.800
First we paint, which is
where we take all of the lines

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.090
and we rasterize them.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.350
And the second part is we take
all those textures that we made

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.120
and we smash them
together on the screen

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.370
using the compositor.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.790
And that's the stage where
you hear layers come about.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.915
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:58.060
And so you can actually see this
pipeline in action in DevTools.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.350
We really, really like
the DevTools timeline view

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.320
because it not only shows you
each of these pipeline stages

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.749
happening, but it also shows
you how long each stage took.

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.165
Which means that you have some
sense of where the time may

00:05:10.165 --> 00:05:14.880
be eaten up if you have some
janky interaction on your page.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.900
And usually the
first thing I do when

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.230
I'm trying to debug some
slow site for whatever reason

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.565
is I open it up and I take a
timeline recording of whatever

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:25.440
it was that was slow.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.680
And I start to get some sense
of the breakdown of where

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.730
that time is going and what it
is that's causing a lot of time

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.230
to be eaten.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.105
NAT DUCA: This is your
first line of defense,

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:36.706
really, when it comes
to jank busting.

00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:37.830
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.050
And if you think
about what properties

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.670
you can animate in CSS, you
know CSS will let you animate

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.910
whatever you want, right?

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.270
But it's important to realize
that not all of these things

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.640
are created equal.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.150
If you change something like the
opacity value on some element,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.320
then all we need to do behind
the scenes is recomposite.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.090
Turns out compositing
is fairly cheap.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.360
We can do it on the GPU.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.180
And we can composite
every frame, no problem.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.330
In fact, Chrome needs to
composite every frame just

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.060
to make a new screen image.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.500
But then you compare that to
something like width or top.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.210
And all of a sudden, you modify
the width property and maybe

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.650
some text [? tree ?] flows.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.460
We need to do a
lot of re-layout.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.060
And everything that
got re-layed out,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.607
and maybe more stuff around
it, needs to be repainted.

00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:27.190
And then everything
that got repainted

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.580
needs to be recomposited.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.670
And all of a sudden,
this whole pipeline

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.030
is kind of in action,
which is very difficult

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.152
to fit in 16 milliseconds.

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:35.860
NAT DUCA: You're now
in danger territory.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.443
The more left you
go in this pipeline,

00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:39.160
the more you're risking jank.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.951
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:41.890
But it's not just the
more left, there's

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.520
kind of a big cliff
right about there.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.420
One of these things is
not like the others.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.420
Painting is really slow.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.500
NAT DUCA: It's
like, really slow.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.300
And we wanted to
share some numbers.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.133
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.730
So this is data from
Chrome Perf, which

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.460
is the dashboard that was
mentioned earlier this morning.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.100
We have a rasterization
time metric.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.187
And if you look at
a Nexus 10 and you

00:07:08.187 --> 00:07:09.770
take a site like the
"New York Times,"

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.830
takes 10 milliseconds
to raster just

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.730
the content that's
currently visible, say,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.900
during the page load.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.025
NAT DUCA: So that's better.

00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:19.810
I mean 10 is not--
OK, sure, fine.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.990
Like, eh, why are
you on about this?

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.560
TOM WILTZIUS: Because then you
go to a site like The Verge,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.935
and all of a sudden, it takes
107 milliseconds to raster.

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:27.300
NAT DUCA: This is not fast.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.580
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.200
And then you go
to Cute Overload,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.730
and it takes 214 milliseconds
to raster, right?

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.160
NAT DUCA: Which is a
lovely site, right?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.254
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:07:36.254 --> 00:07:37.920
I'm not pooh-poohing
any of these sites.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.140
I'm just saying, there
is an incredible amount

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.060
of unpredictability in how
long things take to paint.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.360
And if you think about this
in terms of frames, which

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.800
is kind of a good
logical unit to consider,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.460
then all of a
sudden, you can see

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.795
that 214 milliseconds,
that's 13 frames at 16

00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:56.670
milliseconds a frame.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.770
That means that you
end up in this position

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.850
where if you really
want to be repainting

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.344
all that content every frame,
there's just no way, right?

00:08:04.344 --> 00:08:05.510
NAT DUCA: Seconds per frame.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.790
TOM WILTZIUS: This means
that your frames per second

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:08.975
goes way, way, way down.

00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:09.933
You're nowhere near 60.

00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:10.720
NAT DUCA: Four.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.270
Is that smooth?

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.630
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.610
And this is exacerbated
when, as I kind of alluded

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.840
on the last slide, you end
up in this position where

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.770
you need to paint things
on a per frame basis.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.757
So we call this a paint storm.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.340
If you go into DevTools and you
turn on Show Paint Rectangles,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.409
you'll get a red flash on
the part of the screen that

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.724
repaints every time it repaints.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.140
This is cool because it means
that you can see that during

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.690
this interaction-- this is Nat's
fat finger moving up and down

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.190
on--

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.159
NAT DUCA: It's a fine
finger, isn't it?

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.880
TOM WILTZIUS: --a demo he made.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.837
You can see that there are
key points in that interaction

00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:50.170
where, all of a sudden, there
are these red flashes that

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.711
show up and cover the screen.

00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.960
And this is really bad, right?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.418
Because that means that every
time one of those red flashes

00:08:55.418 --> 00:08:58.290
shows up, then we're paying a
lot of this significant paint

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.100
cost, right?

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.194
And if you were to show sort
of like a timeline view of this

00:09:02.194 --> 00:09:04.360
in Developer Tools, you'd
be able to see exactly how

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.350
long each of those
paints were taking.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.535
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:09:07.535 --> 00:09:10.170
And we see a lot of sites
that basically get pretty far

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.410
along in their lifetime before
they even look at paint rects.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.260
And at that point, you've added
so much complexity to your DOM.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.040
You've got 73 different
things all going on.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.940
You no longer know
which is the one that's

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.670
causing the storm,
what's going wrong.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.860
And so you want to
keep your eye out

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.630
for this from the
beginning of your content

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.260
through its lifetime in
order to defend against this.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.190
Now the defense.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.460
You know, the first line
of defense in this space

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.217
is layers, right?

00:09:35.217 --> 00:09:36.050
We've alluded to it.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.046
We've talked a lot
about it on Jank Free.

00:09:38.046 --> 00:09:40.420
You can look at that demo and
think about it in your head

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.280
and go, well, yeah.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.560
They're these pieces, and
they're just moving around.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.720
So what we can do to
make this smoother

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.940
is keep each one
of those in a layer

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.770
and add them all together.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.360
And if you sort of think about,
then, the movement from frame

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.400
to frame to frame is us just
moving these layers around

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.074
on the screen, no
repainting is necessary.

00:09:58.074 --> 00:09:59.490
So that means we
don't have to get

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.000
those left parts of the
pipeline running that are slow,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.630
the purples and the greens.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.610
And so in theory, this
is smoother, right?

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.950
And so this is
just the same thing

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:15.250
but redone to be no
repaints, or very few.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.919
And so it's a lot smoother.

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:17.710
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.490
And actually, you can
see-- it's probably

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.948
pretty small on
the screen, but you

00:10:20.948 --> 00:10:23.480
can see that there are some
red flashes still happening

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.212
along the far right side of
the mobile device screen.

00:10:26.212 --> 00:10:28.420
That's just us repainting
the scroll bar, which we do

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:28.620
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:28.770
NAT DUCA: Scroll bars.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.355
We haven't optimized them.

00:10:29.355 --> 00:10:30.060
They're small.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.550
TOM WILTZIUS: But you can
see that other than that,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.920
there are no red flashes.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:33.320
NAT DUCA: So that's better.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.445
TOM WILTZIUS: This is good.

00:10:34.445 --> 00:10:36.330
The point here is
that you want to try

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.900
to decompose the
structure of your page

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.890
into logical units that
map well to layers.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.390
And these logical units should
be things that move together,

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.830
that fade together, or that,
maybe, stretch together.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.020
These are things that
are easy to express

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.726
in terms of the
layering triggers

00:10:53.726 --> 00:10:55.350
that we have on the
web platform today.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.475
NAT DUCA: We should make
a postcard that says that.

00:10:57.475 --> 00:10:59.099
Like move together,
stretch together.

00:10:59.099 --> 00:11:01.140
TOM WILTZIUS: And basically,
this maps to the set

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:01.639
of things--

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.510
NAT DUCA: Anybody?

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.926
TOM WILTZIUS: This
maps to the set

00:11:03.926 --> 00:11:05.560
of things that GPUs are good at.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.632
Like GPUs are OK at the
kind of rasterization

00:11:09.632 --> 00:11:11.090
that Nat was talking
about earlier.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.025
But they're really good at
these bulk pixel operations.

00:11:14.025 --> 00:11:14.650
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.200
So think in terms of layers.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.580
It's really, really that
key building block right now

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.230
for getting speed on mobile.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.545
But that having been said--

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.670
TOM WILTZIUS: Great, right?

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.540
What sucks about this?

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:24.730
NAT DUCA: The fine print.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.950
TOM WILTZIUS: Lots of
things suck about this.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.900
We try to make
layers automatically,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.500
but we can't always do it.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.470
Like one of the common questions
we get is always, OK, so great,

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.412
I see how you guys
are explaining

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:37.620
the rendering system working.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.860
Why can't the browser do
all of this on my behalf?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.720
And believe me, we are trying.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.870
But there are some
fundamental limitations

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.215
that we more or
less can't get over.

00:11:48.215 --> 00:11:53.820
The most mundane of these, in
my mind, is text antialiasing.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.499
You'll drop from subpixel, like
LCD screen text antialiasing,

00:11:58.499 --> 00:11:59.790
to grayscale text antialiasing.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.164
NAT DUCA: This is
like ClearType.

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:02.130
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.350
If you're on a
composited layer that

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.933
doesn't have a solid
color background.

00:12:04.933 --> 00:12:07.700
So if you're concerned
about text quality

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.955
and you maybe manually
promoted something to a layer,

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:12.580
try to make it a
solid color background

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.913
and you won't have that problem.

00:12:13.913 --> 00:12:16.320
This is the same reason that
we have different criteria

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.060
for automatically promoting
certain content to layers

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.630
on high DPI versus
low DPI devices

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.040
and on Android versus desktop.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.120
So you need to be testing
all of these places.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.144
This sucks--

00:12:26.144 --> 00:12:28.060
NAT DUCA: This is the
reality that we live in.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.300
TOM WILTZIUS: --but there's
not a lot we can do about it.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.450
NAT DUCA: There are
other things, too.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.290
So for example,
position sticky is

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.810
one of the looks du jour, right?

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.340
And understandably so.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.890
When you try to
emulate that, a lot

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.400
of the times what you
end up having is you

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.150
have a div that you're
moving up and down.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.520
And inside it, you want
a position fixed child

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.570
of that div that's
your sticky element.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.320
Unfortunately, when you
put translateZ(0) on that,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.620
that redefines at
the spec level what

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.730
the position fixed
is relative to.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.780
If you go and do a little
JS fiddle on your own,

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.090
you'll find that position
fixed on something

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.630
that is a layer
through translateZ(0)

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.390
is relative to the actual layer.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.380
So then you can't do
sticky, because you

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.540
want sticky to stick
to the viewport.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.540
If you use this nasty
little dirty trick,

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.019
you might have more headway.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:14.060
And we're going to leave
it at that, because this

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:19.100
is unblessed, but the reality
of the world we live in.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.080
And this is, in fact,
the reality, right?

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.621
TOM WILTZIUS: This
is the web, right?

00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.460
NAT DUCA: And here's another
little unfortunate reality.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.830
Web pages are tall, right?

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.660
You've got lots
of things in them.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.360
10,000, 20,000 pixels
tall is not unusual.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.930
Chrome's rendering
system uses layers

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.350
in order to warm things up.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.790
So we are looking at
all layers assuming

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.410
that they might come on
the screen imminently.

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.610
Has anybody ever done
a trick in their app

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.430
where they put something
at negative 10,000 pixels

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.890
and then they fly it
in with an animation?

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.470
Right?

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.290
It looks really pretty.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.090
But the problem with
that is we, Chrome,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.010
have no idea if something
is negative 10,000 pixels

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.540
from the viewport and can't
become visible next frame,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.530
versus it's negative
10,000 pixels

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:04.530
and the user can't get there.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.330
So this is a thing where we
don't have that understanding.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.150
So if you hide stuff that the
user can't get to any time

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.640
soon, that gives
us less work to do.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.190
We use less CPU, and
you're less janky.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.001
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:17.500
And that's--

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.900
NAT DUCA: That's a good thing.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.140
TOM WILTZIUS: --all really good.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.640
OK.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.320
This is a lot of content
that we just blew through.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.400
And we didn't do any kind
of live demos the way

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.040
we usually do.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.750
But I want to break this down
into simple takeaway messages,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.302
which is that, you want to be
looking for these paint storms.

00:14:32.302 --> 00:14:33.760
You can find them
with DevTools and

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.840
the showPaintRects function.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.370
If you find these
paint storms, you

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.520
want to try to avoid them
through implicit or explicit

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.480
layer creation, if
at all possible.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.685
You can see the layer
borders really nicely

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:49.060
if you go into DevTools and
turn on Show Composited Layer

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.730
Borders.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.740
This is a very nice
visual aid to help you

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.350
with this sort of layer
decomposition process.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.180
And if you're doing
everything right

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.000
and you're still finding that
you have these paint storms

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.270
and you just can't figure out
why it's repainting, because it

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:08.990
doesn't seem like anything
needs to, you may be right.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.465
NAT DUCA: Chrome isn't perfect.

00:15:10.465 --> 00:15:13.289
We've spent a lot of time
making this just work.

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:15.330
There are cases where
Chrome's tiny little brain,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.230
or Blink's tiny little
brain, gets confused,

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.550
and it repaints the universe.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.520
If you're hitting that,
try to reduce it down,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.315
pare it down, and email
Tom or I or file a bug.

00:15:23.315 --> 00:15:24.690
We'll try to get
that sorted out.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.148
TOM WILTZIUS: We've
been, recently,

00:15:26.148 --> 00:15:30.160
on a spree of stamping out
what we call spurious paint

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.662
invalidations, and we
would love to have more.

00:15:33.662 --> 00:15:34.620
NAT DUCA: Bugs welcome.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.100
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.560
OK, so that's
rendering performance

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.880
from the perspective
of JavaScript, right?

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.030
But if what we really
want to talk about

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.200
is responsiveness on
a touch based device,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.880
like a mobile phone,
there's another component

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.680
to the entire story
that we haven't really

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.100
talked about yet.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.146
And that's the input, right?

00:15:55.146 --> 00:15:58.030
Particularly on a
touch device, latency

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.094
can be absolutely killer.

00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:02.510
And Nat's going to walk through
a couple examples of that.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.900
NAT DUCA: We've got two videos
going here, a good and a bad,

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.400
right?

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.250
This should jump
right out at you.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.870
If you drag something
around with your finger,

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.810
you want it to stick
to your finger.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.800
And on the left, you've got
something that's definitely not

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.586
sticky, feels a little laggy
if you're doing this yourself.

00:16:17.586 --> 00:16:19.960
On the right is sort of a
little closer to what you want.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.490
And ideally you get even
closer, as much as you can.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.600
Now getting there
on the web, that's

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.970
the leading edge of innovation
for both Chrome and really

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.870
everyone.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.480
This is a hard problem.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.790
But we'd like to share what
we know about it today.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.410
TOM WILTZIUS: Right,
and a little bit

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.280
about what we've been doing.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.720
So if you're trying to get the
page to stick to your finger,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.579
or say, maybe you
have a slider widget

00:16:43.579 --> 00:16:45.120
and you really want
the slider widget

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.680
to stay under your finger when
you slide the widget around,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.960
then you've kind
of got two options.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.080
Option A is you
get lucky and you

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.860
happen to have an effect
that can be expressed

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.360
in terms of the
fast scroll path.

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:01.810
If you're on this
fast scroll path

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.589
and the browser is sort of
doing the scrolling for you,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:09.660
then you just happen to get
all of the best possible touch

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.720
input latency.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.729
Because we built
that part, and we

00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:14.270
tried to make it as
good as possible.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.845
NAT DUCA: But the
option B happens

00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:17.470
when you're in a
situation where you've

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.280
got to implement a
drawer or a slider

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.200
where the actual
thing-- or a drawing

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.780
app-- the actual
thing that happens

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.710
in response to that input
is necessarily programmatic.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.936
That is not a scroll.

00:17:27.936 --> 00:17:29.310
You need to handle
that yourself.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.660
There's a different set of
rules for making that fast.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.785
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:17:32.785 --> 00:17:34.440
So let's say you
go with option A.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.400
NAT DUCA: Because
that's fun, right?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.233
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:37.760
And often, that totally works.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.920
Depending on your
content, like scrolling,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.190
the reason we have done all
this work about scrolling

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.690
is that scrolling
is one of the most

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.160
common operations
on the web, right?

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.970
And even on mobile devices.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.010
So if you're going
to go this route,

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.840
you want to make sure
that the layers you expect

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.040
to have gotten created
were, in fact, created.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.790
And that they're
working as intended.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:00.700
So this means that whatever
the kind of content area that

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.184
is scrolling should
be in its own layer.

00:18:04.184 --> 00:18:05.600
And when it scrolls,
you shouldn't

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.570
see it all repainting, right?

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.350
And again, the same couple
of basic DevTools features

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:13.300
will let you very
easily visualize

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.470
this, along with timeline.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:16.386
NAT DUCA: We're just
hitting this point again,

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:18.240
which is layers are
good, but they're

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.700
very hard to persuade to exist.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.320
And so you have to be
constant vigilance here

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.894
in order to catch
that fast path.

00:18:25.894 --> 00:18:26.810
TOM WILTZIUS: Exactly.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.393
And a lot of that
vigilance comes down

00:18:28.393 --> 00:18:30.550
to testing the right places.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.760
So it is very tempting
as a developer

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.460
to do everything on
your laptop, right?

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.680
Or on your work station.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.050
But the unfortunate reality
is it's basically impossible

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.390
to emulate the performance
characteristics of an Android

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.520
device on, say,
this nice laptop.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.430
That's not just to do with CPU
versus GPU speed, et cetera.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:52.930
But it has a lot
to do with the fact

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.210
that Chrome actually will behave
slightly differently on Android

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.210
than it does on desktop.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:58.770
The DPI matters.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.660
And all of this is subtle,
and that's unfortunate,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.860
but the reality is building
high performance rendering

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.925
systems is complicated.

00:19:05.925 --> 00:19:07.870
And you need to test
on the target devices.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.010
NAT DUCA: So if you
do hit the fast path,

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:09.970
you're in a good position.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.340
We're doing a lot of work to
make that feel less laggy.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.480
Chrome has been particularly
kind of not good at that.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.039
Notice I didn't say bad.

00:19:18.039 --> 00:19:19.830
TOM WILTZIUS: And it's
gotten a lot better.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.560
NAT DUCA: We're working
hard to make that better.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.310
But that is the case
for native scrolling.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.143
TOM WILTZIUS: Right.

00:19:24.143 --> 00:19:25.130
So what about option B?

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.671
NAT DUCA: So OK,
I'm going to attempt

00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:28.150
to do a little bit
of footwork here

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.810
to try to say how you
can make this work.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.890
This is really bleeding edge.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.380
If you want to do something with
a touch listener and be smooth,

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.410
you have to do these
two things-- you

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.280
got to keep all of your
costs, all of them,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.780
to less than seven
milliseconds, and you

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.360
have to avoid foot guns.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.980
Push stack on the foot guns and
talk about why I said seven.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.271
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah, why not 16?

00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.080
NAT DUCA: Because I
felt like it, really.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.490
OK, we have Chrome running
and then we have your code.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.810
And we're sort of
sharing that system.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.880
In order to get zero
latency, we have

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.700
to run your stuff,
then our stuff, all

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.490
in that 16 millisecond budget.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:05.220
And oh, by the way,
the operating system

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.304
also is there doing stuff.

00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:08.095
TOM WILTZIUS: And this
is the kind of thing

00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:10.750
that you don't generally
worry about on, say, a laptop,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.130
because there's enough
performance overhead that you

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.380
don't really worry
about what Windows

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.540
is doing in the background.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:20.220
But in fact, on most
modern mobile phones,

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.000
even, they're so
resource constrained

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.490
that, actually, some system
thing coming in and running

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.620
can deschedule all of
the browser's threads,

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.009
and then that crap.

00:20:30.009 --> 00:20:30.800
NAT DUCA: So seven.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.490
Keep that in mind.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.160
Keep your stuff.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.860
So this essentially means
don't paint at the moment.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.670
Don't paint.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:36.910
Don't do heavy JS.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.790
Do as minimal JS as you can.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.770
If you've got a
layout, be very careful

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.470
and avoid recalc style
if at all possible.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:45.760
OK, foot guns.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.882
So this is another one of
those laundry slides of,

00:20:48.882 --> 00:20:50.590
like, there's that
nice theoretical world

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:51.530
that we talk about.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.580
TOM WILTZIUS: And then
here's all the caveats.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.130
The first one is
probably the craziest.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.530
If you want to do
this, if you want

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.610
to handle touch events
yourself in JavaScript,

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.710
that means you need touch
event listeners, right?

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.180
If you're going to have
touch event listeners,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.910
be judicious about when
and where you install them.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.330
Particularly, be wary of
installing touch listeners

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.620
during the page
load, or you will

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.280
risk scrolling jank and
unpredictable delivery

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.742
of those touch events.

00:21:19.742 --> 00:21:21.950
NAT DUCA: So we're simplifying
a very complex message

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.470
with this general rule.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.040
And we'll come back to it
later about the details of it.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.700
But just keep this in mind.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.710
Big listeners, touch
listeners, in general,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.850
have a lot of scary.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.550
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.220
Touchends.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.042
I'm going to let you explain
because this is complicated,

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:35.170
too.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:35.470
NAT DUCA: You want me
to talk about touchends?

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.620
This is also complicated.

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:39.720
So if you drag your
finger off a screen,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.489
do you get a touchend
or a touchcancel?

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:43.280
TOM WILTZIUS: What?

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:43.700
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.430
So there's this
common set of problems

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.150
where people forget to
listen to touchcancel,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.420
and so they get basically really
weird behavior in the field.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.100
And they can't figure
out what's going on.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.641
They forgot to listen
to touchcancel.

00:21:52.641 --> 00:21:54.530
It's a minor point,
but very important

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.940
because people will say
that you're being janked.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.620
And the reality is you just
forgot to get that one event.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.430
We're so trained to think, mouse
down, mouse move, mouse up.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.590
All of us grew up like that, so
this is a bit of an adaptation.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.700
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.290
The 300 millisecond
tap delay has

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.870
been mentioned in other talks
and will be pounded on more.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.190
This is to disambiguate between
double tap to zoom and a click.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.870
And yes, this is crappy.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.740
And yes, the
browser tries to not

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.270
wait if it can determine
it's impossible to zoom.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.020
NAT DUCA: Set your
viewport tag correctly

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.350
if you don't care
about [? the page. ?]

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.330
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah,
just be careful.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.496
There's a lot of good content
online about this one,

00:22:29.496 --> 00:22:31.110
so we won't talk
about it too much.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.402
And lastly, mouse wheels.

00:22:33.402 --> 00:22:34.860
Mouse wheels,
obviously not so much

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.420
relevant on mobile, more
relevant on desktop platforms.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.840
But mouse wheel listeners have
a lot of the same problems

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.010
that touch listeners do.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.570
So lest you think that this
is sort of limited to touch.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.046
In fact, you can shoot yourself
in the foot with mouse wheel

00:22:49.046 --> 00:22:49.670
listeners, too.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.680
NAT DUCA: And there's
some major websites

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.500
that actually have
touch listeners.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.840
And so they technically could
hit all these fast paths

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.540
we've been talking
about about latency,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.890
except they have a
mouse wheel listener.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.190
They don't do anything
[INAUDIBLE], ironically.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.505
TOM WILTZIUS: Nope.

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:01.630
Except blog about
how slow Chrome is.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.713
NAT DUCA: But they've shot
themselves in the foot,

00:23:03.713 --> 00:23:05.520
and there's nothing
we can do about.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.030
TOM WILTZIUS: This is
all specced or de facto

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.390
standard behavior, which
means that this is not

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.120
going to change.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.570
NAT DUCA: It's a
wild world out there.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.403
TOM WILTZIUS: It is.

00:23:15.403 --> 00:23:16.370
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.669
So remember we started off
with a video of a janky finger

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:20.710
moving this thing around.

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.610
So imagine your
PM is like, hey, I

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.057
want you to make that logo thing
draggable because I'm your boss

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:28.390
and I'm going to make you do it.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.806
So you're a good [? dooby ?]
and you go code it up, right?

00:23:30.806 --> 00:23:33.610
You document .addEventListener
and touchbegin

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.050
and addEventListener touchmove.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:36.420
And you're like, look, it works.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.986
It's awesome.

00:23:36.986 --> 00:23:38.860
And then you get these
reports from the field

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.760
and they're like, yo,
this is really janky.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.050
Like, I can't use my page.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.220
I love that thing, but like,
you destroyed your page.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.940
You go to these
options in DevTools

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.520
and you show scroll bottlenecks.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.710
This is what you'll see on the
left with a global document

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:54.560
listener.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.660
What's happened is
you've told Chrome

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.870
that your JavaScript wishes
to preempt any input received

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.600
by the user right into
JavaScript all the time.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.550
We cannot think about doing
anything with your input,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:10.280
do any sort of fanciness
that we can do,

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.080
until you say yes or no.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.660
Specifically you
say prevent default

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.240
or fail to prevent
default that event.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.870
And so if you're going
to listen to touch,

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.080
you need to do it on the most
specific thing you can do.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.460
And because of this whole
prevent defaulting thing,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.251
remember the thing we
pushed onto the stack

00:24:27.251 --> 00:24:31.050
earlier about that mysterious
don't add touch before load?

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.290
It's the same thing.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.940
If you have an input handler
and you've told Chrome

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:40.280
that, then any time you touch
the thing that has the handler,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.430
you get automatic preempt
over anything we can do.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.650
Which means that if the
browser is busy doing something

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.830
like recalc style, we can't
do anything in response

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:50.740
to user input.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:51.975
And so you get a jank.

00:24:51.975 --> 00:24:54.350
TOM WILTZIUS: That means we
can't scroll until your touch

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.534
listener runs or we
timeout and we give up.

00:24:56.534 --> 00:24:57.950
NAT DUCA: So be
very, very careful

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.390
about when and where you
install these listeners.

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.181
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:25:01.181 --> 00:25:01.700
Not good.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.600
OK, we've only got
five minutes left,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.530
and we want to talk through
a little bit of where we've

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.280
come from in terms of
the Chrome rendering

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.730
stack and more importantly,
where we're going.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.280
If you've seen us
give talks before,

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.920
you've probably heard
us kind of caveat

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.000
some of the differences
between desktop platforms

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.750
and Android, et cetera.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.530
And there are still differences,
as we mentioned before.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.997
But these days, that's
more about the actual power

00:25:26.997 --> 00:25:29.330
of the device and less about
the rendering architecture.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.550
This is really good
because it makes

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.260
your lives easier as developers.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.530
It makes our lives
easier building Chrome.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.790
And the pace of that catch
up of other platforms

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.540
has accelerated in
the last year or so.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.790
NAT DUCA: But we have a lot
of really fancy technology

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.940
that enables us to run
smoothly on Android.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.380
And it's unevenly
deployed right now.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.990
It's a lot better in Chrome 32.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.830
Hugely better, but
it's still not there.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.230
So this is why we continue
to recommend testing

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.080
on all the platforms you intend
to support, at least for now.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.140
At least in terms
of jank, because

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.607
of these nonuniformities.

00:25:59.607 --> 00:26:00.690
It's the world we live in.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.980
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.620
The Android WebView,
though, is new

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.947
and is further bringing
everything in line.

00:26:05.947 --> 00:26:08.280
NAT DUCA: We wish, though,
to share some things with you

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.055
because it's not
also caveat free.

00:26:10.055 --> 00:26:11.596
TOM WILTZIUS: List
of caveats, right.

00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:14.030
NAT DUCA: Sorry.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.160
There is a rich tradition
on the Android WebView

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.440
to disable hardware
acceleration.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.490
There were good reasons for
this in Android WebView.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.980
There still are
some good reasons

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.040
to do this with the
Chrome-based WebView

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.650
but fewer and different.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.850
We're not going to explain
that sort of curvature space

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.570
directly, but the
thing is, please,

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.424
if you were, in the past,
disabling acceleration

00:26:37.424 --> 00:26:39.340
on your WebView, please
revisit that decision.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.760
Check your content
out in Chrome WebView.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.120
See if it's better.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.600
If it is, Chrome will
reward you in scores.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.840
The hardware-based rendering
is really, really good

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.790
compared to the software one.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.980
TOM WILTZIUS: Another
important caveat, there

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:55.080
are differences
between Chrome itself

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.600
on Android and the WebView.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.310
One of the most significant
is that the DOM size

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.110
matters a lot more.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.300
Chrome tries to be smart
about culling stuff

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.370
that's way away
from the viewport.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.370
But this gets a lot easier
if the developer just

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.147
says, no, this is
right out invisible.

00:27:11.147 --> 00:27:12.980
This is particularly
relevant to the WebView

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.740
because part of the
WebView API contract

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.140
is you can ask for
the whole document.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.920
Which means that
every time we go

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.052
to record things
to paint later, we

00:27:22.052 --> 00:27:23.510
have to record the
entire document.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.180
We can't do any of the
smartness around culling

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:26.290
that we're trying to do.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.762
This means that we
incur a lot more memory,

00:27:28.762 --> 00:27:30.470
and so you need to be
careful about this.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.070
So you want to try to
do your own viewporting,

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.130
if at all possible.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:33.755
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:27:33.755 --> 00:27:35.540
And this is just
that basic thing.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.066
Maybe someday
we'll revisit that,

00:27:37.066 --> 00:27:38.190
but please keep it in mind.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.580
And just sort of a
more broad thing,

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.400
jank busting in a WebView
Android sort of combined app

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.470
means keeping the UI thread
free for both components.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:49.290
They're sharing the same thread.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:53.330
You've got great tooling to
show which one's eating time,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:54.880
but you got to keep
an eye on both.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880
There's nothing that we've
got that protects you

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.005
against janking each other.

00:27:58.005 --> 00:27:59.270
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.600
So where are we going next?

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:04.294
There are these fast paths, but
it's hard to get on to them,

00:28:04.294 --> 00:28:05.710
and it's easy to
fall off of them.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:08.220
We think this sucks just
as much as you guys do.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.360
And we want to make it
better through a combination

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.930
of improving Chrome and
improving Chrome's tooling.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:14.805
So about tooling--

00:28:14.805 --> 00:28:15.430
NAT DUCA: Yeah.

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.388
I mean, so you've seen
a couple little pictures

00:28:17.388 --> 00:28:19.950
like this where we tilt
the web page to the side.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.530
We think that these
things, these questions,

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.690
need to be easily and without
a lot of thought answerable

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.150
for you all to be
more productive.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.910
It should be possible
to see the layers.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.760
It should be possible to see why
something became a layer, why

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.165
something didn't become a layer.

00:28:34.165 --> 00:28:35.790
You should see your
scroll bottlenecks.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.010
None of this should be
so hard as it is now.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.390
And it certainly shouldn't
be a soup of check boxes.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:42.230
This is coming.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:43.180
TOM WILTZIUS: It's difficult
to visually inspect this.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.020
So we need Richard [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.570
NAT DUCA: Mr. Paul
Irish is going

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.916
to be talking about this
in more detail tomorrow.

00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:50.040
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.522
Meanwhile, there's a lot that
we can do behind the scenes

00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:53.730
to keep making Chrome faster.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.370
And there's a lot of
people working on this.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.840
We're trying to fix a
lot of the issues that

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.900
make the slow stages in
the pipeline so slow.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.660
So if you can't just
express yourself

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.657
in terms of
compositing operations,

00:29:05.657 --> 00:29:07.240
there are some basic
changes to layout

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.960
that actually should
be very cheap, right?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.880
Why can't you move something
around with [? top ?]

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.588
if it's absolutely
positioned and doesn't

00:29:12.588 --> 00:29:13.990
affect anything else?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.460
In theory, this should work.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.150
But Blink is just
not that smart.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.370
And so we're trying to
sort of improve that.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.710
And there's a slew of
things along those lines

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:23.960
that are just under optimized.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.168
NAT DUCA: And so we're going
to start thinking about.

00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:27.790
But in parallel with
that, we're also

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.459
starting to get out
of the monofocus

00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.000
that we've had for
the last two years

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.170
to try to just survive
the transition to mobile.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.420
We've been just trying to
scroll a web page basically,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.100
and that was hard.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.742
Surprisingly hard.

00:29:41.742 --> 00:29:43.200
We are now getting
to a point where

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.200
we can contemplate what should
the mobile web really be

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.230
from a jank perspective.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:53.650
How do you all want to express
your intent to the browser

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.350
so that we do the right
thing from the beginning?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.490
We put up a list of
intentionally provocative ideas

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.860
here, just to whet
your appetite.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.109
If anybody has other
ideas, if you've

00:30:06.109 --> 00:30:08.400
got strong opinions about
one of these, if one of these

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.730
makes you want to
storm out of the room,

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.730
stay and storm out of the
room after you tell me

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:12.520
why you hated it.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.905
TOM WILTZIUS: Yeah.

00:30:12.905 --> 00:30:13.290
We'd love to talk about this.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.770
NAT DUCA: But we want
to make this better.

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:19.630
And the reason is, we know
that it's not good enough.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:21.570
And we know that,
now that we've got

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.410
scrolling sort of
figured out, we

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.960
need to go and make
the tools better,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.870
we need to make this
more accessible, we need

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.800
to make just jank on the web
sort of a solved you don't

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.096
think about it problem.

00:30:33.096 --> 00:30:34.220
TOM WILTZIUS: That's right.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:35.830
So with that, we're
going to wrap up.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.910
Thank you very much for
your time and attention.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:39.020
I'm Tom, and this is Nat.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.772
And thanks again.

00:30:39.772 --> 00:30:40.480
NAT DUCA: Cheers.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.895
[APPLAUSE]
