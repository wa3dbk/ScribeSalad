00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.340
Hi, I'm Adam, a researcher working on the
extension system for Google Chrome.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.639
In building the extension system, we've designed
in security from day one. Security has many

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.910
facets, but in this video, I'd like to focus
how the extension system makes it easier for

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.140
developers to create secure extensions.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.150
The security architecture is based on two
principles: least privilege and privilege

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.669
separation.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.010
Extensions get only those privileges requested
in their manifest. For example, the Gmail

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.570
Checker extension declares that it wishes
to interact with Gmail. Because it does not

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.770
request access to your bank, Gmail Checker
is not granted access to your bank.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.470
Now, least privilege does not protect you
from malicious extensions. If you install

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.570
a malicious extension, all bets are off, just
like when you install a malicious program

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.210
on your computer. Instead, least privilege
helps if an honest extension has a vulnerability.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.810
If somehow, an extension is compromised, the
attacker's privileges will be limited.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.980
As you develop extensions, you should request
only those privileges your extension actually

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.810
needs, reducing your attack surface and helping
protect your users.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.960
In addition to least privilege, the extension
system encourages privilege separation. Instead

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.560
of lumping all their code together, developers
divide their extension into two pieces: a

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.770
background page, and a content script.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.420
The background page is given the lion's share
of the extension's privileges but is isolated

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.320
from direct contact with web pages. On the
other hand, content scripts have direct contact

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.799
with web pages, but have fewer privileges.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.770
If a content script is compromised, the attacker
doesn't get all the extension's privileges.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.920
To steal all the privileges, the attacker
has to exploit a second vulnerability, such

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.950
as a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
the background page.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.549
We've designed security into the Google Chrome
extension system from day one. Using least

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.200
privilege and privilege separation, we've
helped developers reduce the attack surface

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.570
of their extensions.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.089
