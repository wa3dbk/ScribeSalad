00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.570
ALEKSEY: So we're back here at
Devoxx, and I'm here with Sam

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.900
Dutton to talk about
disruptive media.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.630
That's what your--

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.930
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.190
ALEKSEY: --session was called.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.660
So you're working on standards,
and you believe

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.530
standards can actually
help to create

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.110
stimulate content creation.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.670
And by content creation, we mean
maybe are you an artist,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.450
and we can bring to the
web something that

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.490
was not there today.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.200
So tell me what--

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.440
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, sure.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.480
We're really looking forward
to seeing what

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.120
people make of WebRTC.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.050
I mean, at this point, it's been
kind of in the hands of

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.087
people who do telephony and
videoconferencing and so on.

00:00:43.087 --> 00:00:45.490
But I think what's really
exciting is what web

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.105
developers are going to make,
because they're going do a

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:49.070
whole stack of creative
stuff with that now.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.780
It's fantastic.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.700
ALEKSEY: So WebRTC is just one
of the technologies, and we'll

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.670
talk about that.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.500
Is that part of a bigger
picture, or is that the one

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.470
and only thing you need?

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.340
SAM DUTTON: So WebRTC has
several components.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:09.260
So you need some way to get
streaming media to work with

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.580
WebRTC, so that has the
Media Stream API.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.590
People have done some stuff
already, some great demos,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.630
using getUserMedia with that.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.520
And then the kind of meat of
the project is this thing

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.570
called RTC PeerConnection, which
is the bit that deals

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.110
with streaming data between
the two peers.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.240
ALEKSEY: And peers
are browsers.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.570
There's no--

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.630
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
and a peer is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.270
ALEKSEY: --separation
involved in there.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.870
SAM DUTTON: No, that's right.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.690
So just to kind of rewind a bit,
what we've had with the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.470
internet is that with the web,
we've had this kind of--

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.790
I don't know--

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.320
kickstarting of the
information age.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.450
We've had this ability to kind
of share information, to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.310
create stuff and distribute it,
and then to discover stuff

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
and to actually consume content
and services and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.990
media and so on.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.430
Now, that's great, but there's
been this kind of missing

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.010
piece, which is the business of
kind of person to person,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.270
like person-to-person
communication.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.650
This is kind of one of the last
really major challenges

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.560
for the web.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.660
And this is what we need with
real-time communication.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.970
And that's what WebRTC
is bringing to us.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.030
ALEKSEY: And this is what
used to cost a lot and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.640
systems can do that.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.830
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.210
ALEKSEY: We technically
can do that today.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.410
SAM DUTTON: Absolutely.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.740
Yeah, sure.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.430
ALEKSEY: But the web can make
that accessible to--

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.360
take it to the next level.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.890
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.000
So what we've had in the past
is kind of corporate closed

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.780
systems that have--

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.920
some have worked better than
others, but they've always

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.650
been expensive to implement and
difficult to integrate.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.100
And of course, there's never
been a way to directly

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.690
integrate stuff with
your web apps.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.900
What we have now is the use of
plug-ins like Flash, which

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.690
work well in many ways, but are
problematic and that are

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.500
essentially closed
and are separate.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.490
And also thinking about
security, they're not part of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.700
the sandbox browser
environment.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.040
So WebRTC has also been built
with security in mind using

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.040
secure protocols, and because
it's within the browser,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.070
continually updated,
sandboxed.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.645
It's inherently more secure.

00:03:10.645 --> 00:03:12.040
ALEKSEY: So what do you send?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.240
What kind of data
can you share?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.510
I mean, developers care
about that, obviously.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.330
SAM DUTTON: It's exciting to
think what people are going to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.680
do with it.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.820
So with WebRTC, the kind of
core of it is this idea of

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.450
voice and video calling.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.470
That kind of makes sense.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.970
So a lot of the optimizations
have been about working with

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.660
voice to essentially do what
you can do with telephony.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.460
But we've also got this
ability to do really

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.890
high-quality video chat.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.910
We're already seeing very good
quality, very low-latency

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.490
video chat, which
is fantastic.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.870
The third part of the WebRTC
picture in a way is an API

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.400
called Data Channel.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.240
Now, what that enables you to do
is arbitrary streaming data

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.960
between browsers.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.340
So that's like anything.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.440
So you could be streaming any
kind of arbitrary data, not

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.780
just audio video
data, anything.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.910
So a stack of really--

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.730
I mean, who knows?

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.950
ALEKSEY: Oh yeah.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.630
I can imagine quite a
few things already.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.020
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.760
ALEKSEY: So maybe
for developers,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.980
what does RTC mean?

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.899
I mean, where do they get
started, and why is it even a

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.079
good thing in the first place?

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.960
I mean, they like Flash today,
and maybe that-- so just for

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.510
the player, that offers
some solution.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.880
SAM DUTTON: Absolutely.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.100
So, I mean, we've talked to
Flash developers who've kind

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.000
of had some struggles and are
really pleased to hear about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.710
the project, in particular
because it's--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.260
you know, WebRTC provides--

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.700
they're just APIs within the
browser, so they're really

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.570
easy to integrate with your
existing workflow and your

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.690
existing web apps.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.700
ALEKSEY: It is web development,
right?

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.300
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, it's
web development.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.070
ALEKSEY: It's just another
API, right?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.450
SAM DUTTON: It's not like you've
got to bring in the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.560
Flash guy or the whatever, and
you've got people who work on

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.250
the web, who use the web, who
use the API, so that's the

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.860
first part.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.380
The second big deal is that
there's no licensing.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.140
Google has done a huge amount of
work on this stuff and made

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.190
it then open sourced and freely
available, so there's

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.690
no licensing for the developers

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.010
or for the end users.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.340
So, it's good for everyone

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.240
ALEKSEY: OK, great.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.350
So where should people go to
get started if they're

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.065
interested?

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:21.580
And what does the next six
months or 12 months or two

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.630
years look like?

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.350
SAM DUTTON: So the place
to start with WebRTC is

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.680
webrtc.org.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.020
It's the kind of natural
home for WebRTC.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.200
There's articles
on HTML5 Rocks.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.435
There's a book called "WebRTC
Book," a really nice books for

00:05:39.435 --> 00:05:40.030
the Kindle.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.200
It's about six pounds
something.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.220
It's cheap, about eight
euros, I think.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.660
There's some great video, too.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.740
Check out Justin Uberti's Google
I/O video, a really

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.240
good place to start.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.870
And yeah, there's lots
of resources

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.830
online to get you started.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.800
ALEKSEY: What does the roadmap
for WebRTC look like?

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.330
SAM DUTTON: So the next six
months, well, there's a lot of

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.480
work on keeping going with
standardization projects.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.120
We want to integrate
Mozilla work.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.700
WebRTC has just been implemented
in Firefox

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.500
nightlies in Aurora, and we
want to integrate the work

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.270
there with the work that's been
implemented in Chrome.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.680
Obviously, there's a big
push now for mobile.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.370
That's the kind of natural
home for personal

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.620
communication.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.270
And then, of course, Data
Channel, to see an

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.080
implementation.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.890
It is in Firefox, but we want
to see that in Chrome soon.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:35.860
ALEKSEY: OK, wonderful.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.790
So lots of things to look at.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.520
SAM DUTTON: Yes, indeed.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.650
ALEKSEY: Thanks, Sam.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.340
SAM DUTTON: Cheers, Aleksey.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.590
Good to talk.
