&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Hello, everyone. I think we're
ready to get started.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.100
Welcome to Jank Busters. I'm Tom Wiltzius.
I'm a PM on the Chrome graphics team.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.450
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: I'm Nat Duca. I'm a graphics hacker
on the Chrome team.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.210
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: And we're here today to talk
about Jank on the web, what it is and how

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.550
to avoid it.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Yeah. So Jank. Everybody has a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.359
screen in front of them, probably. Jank really
begins with the monitor, right? You've got

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.179
this monitor in front of you and it's designed
to sort of trick your eye into this illusion

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.440
of motion, and the way it does that is by
updating a frame every couple milliseconds,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.340
right?
And the trick is, your eye wants to go at

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.340
something like 40 hertz, and if you do that,
then you'll perceive motion.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.550
And so monitors out there go anywhere from
30 to 50 to 60 to 70 hertz, right? And if

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.640
you manage to get all of your JavaScript and
all your different pieces going at that rate

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.360
of the monitor, then you can present this
illusion of smoothness and then people are

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.710
happy.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: But if you don't manage that,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.320
then you end up with Jank. And this is what
we're talking about when we're talking about

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.790
Jank.
It's anytime that you don't get a new image

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.030
on the screen every time the monitor refreshes.
This comes in all sorts of formats. A hitch

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.479
is when we miss a bunch of frames in a row.
A low frame rate is when you're taking out

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.960
a frame every maybe fifth of a second instead
of every 50th. A variable frame rate is maybe

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.450
some combination of these things. And this
is particularly painful when you're trying

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.530
to interact with something.
So here's a div with a bunch of Chrome logos

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.759
moving around and it scrolls sluggishly. It's
what we call a Janky scroll. And the problem

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:42.150
here is that as I move my finger on the trackpad,
I'm scrolling around in this little iframe

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.710
but the frame rate isn't matched up to the
monitor's refresh rate, and as I move my finger,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.759
I don't get the smooth motion on the screen
that I sort of expect.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.600
And so the physical metaphor is broken and
it doesn't -- it doesn't feel good. It doesn't

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.220
feel fluid.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Yeah. So, you know, basically

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.539
what's going on behind the scenes when you
get dropped out of your experience and you

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.810
get something like Jank is one part of the
rendering pipeline is getting behind, right?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.730
Now, if you go on line and you look at our
talk from last year's I/O and also a lot of

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.400
great resources out there on Jank busting,
you'll find that there's this great feature

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.250
in DevTools called the frames mode. It's in
the Timeline. And you can use that to record,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.420
basically, an interaction with your page and
see, for example, "Oh, hey, this frame ran

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.530
long because of JavaScript." And there are
just thousands of things that can go wrong.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.710
CSS can run long. You can have an XHR that
comes back and does some big json parse. You

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.569
can have an image decode that fires. You can
-- you know, I can go on for hours on this,

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.450
you know.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: What Nat is trying to say

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.180
is there's a lot that gets in the way of the
16 milliseconds you have to make a new image

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.180
before the monitor refreshes. And there are,
as Nat says, lots and lots of ways that this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.189
can go poorly but today we're going to talk
about one kind of specific category and that's

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.950
what are essentially the green bars in the
vertical Timeline in DevTools.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.730
This is what we call sort of rendering, but
that breaks down into painting and compositing

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.230
and we're going to talk about both of those
in today's talk.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.989
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: And it's good that Tom saved you
from me yammering on because you'd just fall

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.010
asleep and be wasting your time.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.480
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: So rendering, what are we
going to talk about today? We're going to

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.519
talk about painting speed, what -- what kind
of goes into it and how you can try to paint

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.909
as quickly as possible. But then even better
than that, we're going to try to talk about

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:36.260
how you can avoid painting in the first place,
either because you were doing so accidentally

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.900
and you didn't realize it -- and we're going
to show you how to notice that kind of thing

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.689
-- and then better yet, we're going to talk
about how to deliberately avoid paints from

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:47.469
the get-go when you're designing your application.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: And there will not be a rocket

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:51.140
ship that we can give you at the end as a
takeaway, so sorry.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.430
The beginning building block of rendering
in a web browser is preparing pixels to be

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.769
put up on the screen.
So if you go to Google -- right? -- we've

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.579
all been there, you're presented with this,
which is the nice little happy hello Google

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.709
thing, and you get a blinking cursor, right?
Where the only difference between the page

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.370
over time is the cursor coming on and off.
Now, what Chrome's doing behind the scenes

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.930
is it's actually filling in those black dots
for the cursor itself, and what it's doing

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.490
is it's got some, you know, logic in it that
says, "Ooh, this part of the page has changed.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.830
I need to refill those pixels with black or
I need to remove them."

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.889
And so you get this little update req, this
painted area on the screen that we repaint

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.090
and then you see this illusion of a blinking
cursor.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.260
Now, if you think about that, that takes some
time but it's probably relatively little and

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.940
if I compared the time taken to blink the
cursor versus, say, if I just had the whole

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.780
Google logo blinking -- now, of course people
would be upset if I did that to our home page,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.490
but also, it would take more time to do it,
okay? Because there's just -- you can sort

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.310
of think about this. This is intuitive. We
have to touch more pixels, right? So that's

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.100
one dimension of rendering performance and
in particular painting speed, is how many

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.080
pixels you've touched.
But that's not the only dimension, of course.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.889
The other part that matters is what you touch
and what type of content is in the area that

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.770
you're updating.
So if you take this white block on the upper

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.900
left, that's just white. And if you think
about what Chrome has to do to make those

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.120
pixels white, it just has to sort of put RGBA
for white into a bunch of parts of memory.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.250
So that's a mem set and it's pretty darn fast.
In contrast, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.240
has all sorts of nasty little details on it,
and it's actually kind of fun to zoom on this

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.170
on a computer with a magnifying glass and
see all the things going on there. If any

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.300
of you have actually taken like an undergrad
graphics class and had to write like a line

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.150
drawing algorithm, imagine having to do that
in Chrome but where you also have antialiasing

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.890
and rounded corners and blurs and text and
anti-alias text. It gets really hairy and

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.030
it's sort of the thing that makes you want
to jump off a, you know, cliff, but it's also

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.669
the thing that makes the CPU chug along.
So painting is a slow thing and it's something

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.020
to be avoided pretty much at all costs.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: And you want to wonder probably

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.569
like what -- what is expensive and what isn't,
right? Like Nat is just asserting that like,

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:16.419
oh, drawing his NTOS lines is expensive, but
in an ideal world you would be able to measure

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.569
this kind of thing. And this is something
that DevTools does allow you to do to a certain

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.410
extent. A good question to ask is like, "Well,
which elements on the page are expensive?"

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.949
And a good way to measure that is with continuous
painting mode in DevTools, which is a DevTools

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.539
setting that we're not going to talk about
in great detail today but there are some really

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:39.540
good resources on the web about how to use
it. This link -- and our slides will be linked

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.979
on the web later -- will take you to an article
that explains in detail how to use continuous

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.410
painting mode to repaint the entire frame
as fast as possible and tell you how long

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:54.379
that takes and then you can hide certain elements
and see how does that affect the painting

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:56.940
time. Because often as not, it's a single
complicated element that's taking all the

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.681
time.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: When you look at your page, look

00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:02.790
at all the pieces and keep in the back of
your head that not all of them are the same

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.039
cost and you're paying for some of those effects
more than others. And if you start getting

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.710
in a situation where you see painting, start
figuring out which ones you're paying for

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.129
and whether you really want to be paying for
that bill for that one.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:17.349
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. Painting also,
I should say, isn't -- it's not just about

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.199
the blinking cursor, right? In the blinking
cursor case, it makes sense that we need to

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.729
repaint like the part of the screen that's
changed because the pixel output is different.

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:30.819
But there are plenty of cases on the web where
even if you change something that doesn't

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:37.070
have any sort of material impact on the final
presentation of what goes up on the screen,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.640
you can still incur a costly repaint, and
we're going to show a small demo of that right

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.330
now.
If I hit this button, I get elements that

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.070
are added to this screen. It's -- this is
really simple. These are just gray divs. Basically

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.039
styles, right?
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Winner of Web Site of the Year

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.949
for 2013.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Thanks, Nat.

00:07:54.949 --> 00:08:00.009
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Because you're good.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: And what we want to do here

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:04.039
is get some insight into what is being painted
when by the browser.

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:09.300
So if we open up DevTools and we turn on show
paint rectangles under the rendering heading

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.870
of settings, then we have -- we have the ability
to really see what gets painted as the page

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.870
changes.
So again, I'm going to hit this button a few

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:24.189
times and you can see that as I add additional
elements, there's a red -- red rectangle that

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:29.180
flashes over the element and that red rectangle
means, "This part of the screen just got repainted

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.160
by Chrome." Or really by Blink in this case.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: So that's that rectangle that

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.370
I was showing you in slides but in runtime
for your production site.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.940
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. And I can keep
adding elements, and now I'm adding elements

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.480
like way below the fold of the page and you
can see that as I add more, the only thing

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.370
that gets repainted here is the button, because
it ends up in this depressed state and then

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.110
comes out of it, and the scrollbar, because
the scrollbar size is changing.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.920
So this is great, right? And it makes sense
in some sort of basic logic that as you're

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.579
adding elements below the fold of the page,
you're not having to repaint anything that

00:09:02.579 --> 00:09:09.700
is on the page. But it's not always that simple.
If I try to do something like inspect this

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:15.339
container block -- and the DevTools inspection
is going to drive the paint rectangles nuts

00:09:15.339 --> 00:09:20.279
a little bit, but if I look at this block
that contains all of these elements and then

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:25.060
I toggle, say, how much padding there is on
the right side of that container block, I'm

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.650
not going to end up with any, again, visible
change to what gets rendered.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:34.160
These divs are sized such that even if there's
an extra 10 pixels of padding on the right

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.350
side of that container, the layout is not
going to change, nothing is going to look

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.680
any different. But watch what happens when
I add some of that padding. You can see in

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:49.170
-- it's probably small text, but padding has
showed up in the element style in inspector

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.210
and I got this big red rectangle that flashed
over the entire container. And the reason

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:59.420
is that Blink, I mean, it's not that smart,
right? And so when some of this padding got

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.850
added, there was a series of steps that it
went through that said, "Okay, now I need

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:10.670
to think about do I need to recalculate the
position of any of the elements inside of

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.800
this container block?"
The answer ends up being "no" but in the process,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.399
it invalidates the -- the sort of visible
state of all of these elements on the screen

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.170
and then they all get repainted.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Yeah. Blink has a well-meaning

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:25.760
but sometimes confused brain and so, you know,
in this case it's getting confused. It thinks

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.490
that maybe something bad is about to happen
and it causes a repaint. And this is the sort

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:32.500
of thing that actually happens more often
than we'd like.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.660
When you use and write really nice modular
code that's beautiful and has all sorts of

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.110
awesome design patterns in it, sometimes this
sort of thing will creep in because somewhere

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.070
deep in there somebody added a class and then
removed a class somewhere else and that confused

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:50.200
the system. So this is something to keep your
eye out for when you're doing sort of day-to-day

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.540
production. Keep an eye out for these erroneous
blinks where you would expect there to be

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.060
no red flash and there is. Because once they
start creeping in, they're really devilishly

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.399
hard to stamp out again.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Very true. So switching gears

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:08.830
a little bit, we've talked about painting
now, but the -- the next best thing from trying

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:14.170
to avoid unnecessary paints is to not paint
at all. And Nat's going to talk a little bit

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:16.250
about how we do that for common cases like
scrolling.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.029
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: So like in ye old days -- right,
like 1990 something, the way that we would

00:11:21.029 --> 00:11:25.370
scroll a page in a browser was we would repaint
parts of it. So we would move bits of the

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.820
pixels up using some low-level things, and
then we'd do a big repaint rectangle on the

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.519
area that you'd exposed from the scroll.
Now we just talked for, you know, a while

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:40.110
about how devilishly slow painting is and
how it should be avoided. So developers in

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.300
both, you know, Webkit and Blink and Chrome
and pretty much everywhere have adopted this

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:48.389
new notion of a layer.
If you look at this picture we've got up of

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:53.209
Gmail, the analogy is this: If I look at Gmail,
I know that there's a part of the page that's

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:57.720
just going to move up and down. It's not going
to change visually. It's just there are going

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.000
to be new pieces shown that weren't previously
visible. Right?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.080
But the stuff on top of it, the -- the top
nav and the left thing, they'll always be

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.449
there. And so there's this sort of idea of
"Hey, we will detect that using semantic cues

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:14.839
in your thing like it being an overflow div
and we will turn those into layers and each

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:20.040
layer becomes a picture that we upload to
the GPU on your computer, store there, and

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.889
then if the thing that you're doing to your
page is just moving the layers around, we

00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:28.889
can ask the GPU to scroll it for you." Or,
in fact, reposition it and then ask the GPU

00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:32.949
to recompose them. And so it looks like you're
scrolling because you're only looking down

00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:35.660
at the layers. You just see it -- you know,
it looks like you're seeing the whole Web

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:40.450
page. But what's happening underneath is the
browser is just re-compositing, skipping that

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:47.320
expensive paint step, and going nice and jankfree.
But this all depends -- this jankfreeness

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.420
is all predicated on you getting good layers
in the first place, and if you don't get those

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.560
layers created, things can go a little bit
haywire.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.590
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. It's also predicated
on not like the good layers. It's predicated

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:02.190
on the layers being set up in such a way that
we don't need to paint them, right? Like if

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.470
the layer content is changing, then all bets
are off on this being a good system. So I'll

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:16.260
open up another demo, and this one -- maybe
it will load...

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.870
You want to turn off --
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: I will turn off WiFi.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:25.720
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: -- WiFi and try again?
In a case where we scroll -- in this case,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.329
a whole long list of images, we can -- we
can do that pretty well, right?

00:13:31.329 --> 00:13:34.720
Nothing on the page is changing here. This
is really a simple sort of like static media

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.380
site scenario. And indeed, we can scroll this
-- this quite well.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:45.830
This whole sort of body of the page is in
a layer. It's being re-composited every frame.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:51.970
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: We shall bless this jankfree.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right. But if I open up DevTools

00:13:51.970 --> 00:14:00.060
again and I turn on show paint rectangles,
as I had, then you can see that part of the

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.329
kind of jankfreeness here is that nothing
is being repainted. The only thing that's

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:06.010
being repainted is, again, the scrollbar so
we can kind of afford.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.990
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: So we're keeping that contract
with the browser: I won't repaint and you'll

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.600
be jankfree.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. But if I hover

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.420
over this image, I've got actually kind of
like a nice animation that happens. I add

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:20.130
a shadow, I change the opacity, I brighten
the image a little bit. This is the kind of

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.120
thing that's become increasingly common. And
as I do that, you can see that because it's

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.389
sort of a complicated animation that Chrome
doesn't accelerate very well, I get a lot

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:33.570
of repaints throughout the course of the animation
and that's those red rectangles flashing over

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:39.570
the animation again. But that animation is
going to play really, really poorly with the

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:43.820
scroll, and you can probably guess why by
now, based on everything we've just said.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.209
The -- the browser is going to start repainting
to run the animation right at the time when

00:14:49.209 --> 00:14:55.110
it -- what it wants to be doing is re-compositing
this static unchanging content over and over

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.801
again in different positions. But if the content's
changed, then it can't just reposition it.

00:14:58.801 --> 00:15:02.961
It needs to repaint it first, re-upload it
to the GPU, and then re-composite it. You

00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:09.110
lose all the benefits. And indeed, if I try
to scroll with my mouse over here, the resolution

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.920
of this screen is hurting me a little bit,
but it gets a lot Jankier, and you can see

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:18.199
that these are these big red flashes that
occur all over -- all over the page and that

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:22.410
gets in the way of sort of a jankfree scroll.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Yeah. So these big red flashes

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:26.510
are your warning to -- you know, your one-way
trip to Janktown, right? You've got big red

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.089
flashes and you're basically going to start
repainting all the time and then on a low-end

00:15:31.089 --> 00:15:35.269
machine -- this is a Mac Book Pro so of course
it's going to be in better shape, but on a

00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:37.560
lower-end machine especially you're going
to really start paying dearly.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.370
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: This is the type of thing
that we see as particularly painful on like

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:46.449
phones or tablets. In this case, I mean, getting
rid of the hover effect is a relatively simple

00:15:46.449 --> 00:15:52.829
task, right? So if I uncheck this box, there's
a scroll handler here that will disable the

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:58.509
hover effect when it first runs and then sets
a timer and 200 milliseconds after the final

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:03.079
on-scroll event, it will re-enable the hover
effects. This means that I can start scrolling

00:16:03.079 --> 00:16:07.519
and the hover effects get disabled and no
repaint is happening during the scroll but

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:11.089
then as soon as the scroll is done, I still
get my sort of nice animation.

00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:14.611
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: And this is sort of your instant
recipe to making it smooth, right? Is if you

00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:18.269
are willing to compromise on some of those
gorgeous hover effects or whatever it is that

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:22.399
is causing your repaint in the first place,
if you're willing to reduce it during the

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:26.350
scroll or simplify your content in some way,
you can go nice and fast again.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.779
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. I mean, this
is changing the behavior of the page, right?

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.200
And that's not always going to be acceptable
to you. So it's important to understand that

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.450
there are often tradeoffs between how well
something performs and what it looks -- what

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.912
it looks like, but it isn't always going to
be possible to achieve whatever sort of like

00:16:41.912 --> 00:16:46.880
crazy effect you want in a -- a totally nice
performance way.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.410
We're sort of picking on hover here, but really
there are all sorts of things that can cause

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:56.630
this sort of problem.
The -- the real thing you want to do is use

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.010
show paint reqs to sort of look for these
big red flashes during your scroll or during

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.760
your animation and then try total rid of them.
So hover effects are one thing to look out

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:10.720
for but there are a lot of others as well.
Common problems come from fixed-position elements

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:18.350
or overflow scroll divs or touch listeners,
mouse wheel events, trying to reposition things

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.180
in an on-scroll handler for like paralax effects
sites. These are all things that we see that

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.670
--
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Social widgets that you position

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.670
when people hover over an article and stuff
like that. Like give the pages a chance to

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.410
settle before you bring in your, you know,
+1 button, right?

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.110
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right. Which is not to say
that like these things are bad, right? It's

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.940
just that you need to be aware that in sort
of liberally using them, you may end up in

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.960
a position where you really end up fighting
with the rendering system and the performance

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.800
is going to go through the floor. There are
cases where you really do need that paint,

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.580
though, you really do want something to change
accident occurring a scroll, and that's fine.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.180
If it's fast enough, you can still be Jankfree,
right? But you're going to have to be very

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.250
vigilant about keeping paint as cheap as possible.
For this, you want to be paying a lot of attention

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.670
to how visually complicated your CSS is and
continuous painting mode that we plugged earlier

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.210
is a good way to try to reduce the cost of
a lot of those paints. Image decodes and resizes

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.830
can be really painful. If you're on a media
site with tons of images, you can blow the

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.470
image cache inside of Blink and that can be
really painful.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.680
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Constant vigilance.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Constant vigilance is the

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.310
answer, yeah. But now Nat's going to talk
about some of the other great applications

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.750
of layers.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Well, I think we've got another

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.560
demo for you which is always fun, more fun
than us talking but, you know, here's the

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.220
thing. We showed you how you can use layers
to scroll smoothly, right? And that's -- you

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.960
can sort of understand that, when we're moving
something up and down. But people like, you

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.790
know, drawers and -- and hover effects and,
you know, slides that -- that zoom in from

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.390
the left, right?
And this is a really cool thing. There are

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.000
some amazing things you can do here. But the
way to make it fast versus the way that you

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.100
encode it up quick are often not well aligned,
so it's very important when you do sort of

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.970
animations to also think about layers and
also think about how can I construct this

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:58.010
animation so it plays well with Chrome's layered
rendering model, not fights against it.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.500
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right. And a lot of that comes
down to how can I run this animation without

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:07.790
incurring any paints. So here's a really simple
drawer. This is styled like incredibly plainly,

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:14.960
but you can see that if I open up DevTools
and I have show paint reqs on, that as I run

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.860
this animation, which is a simple CSS animation
on the left property -- right? -- like very

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:26.110
basic, I get repaints of the drawer throughout
the entire animation. That means every frame,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:30.870
this entire part of the screen is being repainted,
re-uploaded to the GPU, and re-composited.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.200
And that's, again, relatively painful.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: And if you take that to a low-end

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.160
device, it will be worse and worse and worse.
Six times worse, often.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.590
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right. So the question you
want to be asking yourself is, "okay, like

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:46.230
how do I get around this? Like how do I avoid
these red rectangles?" And it so happens that

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:53.090
one good way to do so for moving things like
this is with transforms, through CSS 3 transforms,

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:58.321
rather than changing the position property.
Transforms take elements out of the flow of

00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:03.530
the page, which gives the browser some stronger
guarantees about what it can move without

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.870
risking having to reflow other elements.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: This is an example of not all

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:13.140
-- you can make the same look in CSS with
different types of selectors or different

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:19.060
types of attributes and get the same visual
look. But it is going to perform totally differently.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.520
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Chrome has all these fast
pass. But you kind of need to find them, which

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:30.500
can be painful. If I use a Webkit transform
here and a translate X, I have this comparatively

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.390
much nicer animation, right? You can see it
is a little bit smoother if your eyes are

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:39.930
attuned to it. But the really nice thing is
I'm not getting any paints, there is no red

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.420
rectangles throughout the animation. There
are red rectangles at the beginning and end,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:48.260
though. And we will talk about those next.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: If you get somebody who stamps

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:52.750
out that first bit of animation and Tom comes
over to me and says, I got it! I got it! We

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.980
just have red flashes getting in. It is not
good enough. Never, ever paint. That's what

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.660
we are looking for. Not, oh, I reduced it
a bit. It's, Don't paint.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.410
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: We are standing up here stating
that this thing is now fast because it is

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.530
in layer. You shouldn't take our word for
it. You should want to look for this yourself.

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.750
The way to do that is to open up DevTools
again, turn on show composited layer borders

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:22.230
in DevTools settings. And if you look really
carefully -- I will zoom in here -- there

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:27.940
is an orange border that goes around the edge
of the page and that orange border is your

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:33.120
cue that says, The content inside of this
border is in its own layer.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.010
You can see there is only one orange border.
It is probably hard to see from the audience

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.870
on this screen.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Trust us.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.360
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: There is only one orange border
on this particular page because there is only

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:47.070
one layer. Again, look really carefully. I
will zoom in again. Look really carefully

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.430
at the edge of the drawer as this animation
runs. You can see that there is another orange

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:56.780
border that pops up along the edge of the
drawer during the animation. And that's your

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:02.102
sign that says, Oh, this content actually
got promoted to its own layer and now it is

00:22:02.102 --> 00:22:08.130
being moved back and forth, which is great.
But the question is: Why the red rectangles

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.710
at the beginning and end?
And if you look carefully, maybe you can guess

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:17.200
why. There isn't an orange border before or
after this animation runs, right? So what's

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.930
happening is that the layer that the drawer
is in during the animation doesn't exist before

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.300
or after the animation, right?
So the animation starts. We pop the drawer

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:32.070
out. Put it in its own layer. It is a new
layer so we need to render its contents, right?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:35.860
That's the first red flash.
Then we recomposite it, recomposite it, recomposite

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:40.460
it, move it all the over and pop it back into
the base layer. And when we pop it into the

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:46.290
base layer, we need to repaint that part of
it. That's the second red flash.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:52.170
How do we avoid this? One way is sort of incidental.
If you use a translate 3D instead of a translate

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.720
X, you get a layer even when the thing isn't
moving because it will be promoted to a layer

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.390
not due to the animation but due to the CSS
transform itself.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:09.430
If we try that and run this animation, you
can see that I can now run it back and forth,

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.580
no red rectangles.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Look, Ma, no red flash, right?

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.930
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's great. That's kind
of what we want. And if I open up the timeline

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.730
view, we talked about vertical timeline earlier,
usually you would see all sorts of paint events

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:27.340
and stuff, right? But if I start a recording
and run this animation, you can see that throughout

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.850
the animation, all we get are these composite
layer operations over and over and over again,

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:36.470
which are comparatively super, super cheap.
That's really good. This is the ideal timeline

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:43.950
case where, yes, things are moving but there
is a minimum of other stuff going on. So that's

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.370
drawers.
But sometimes this isn't quite enough. Sometimes

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:52.400
just seeing those borders isn't enough to
tell you really what's going on, especially

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:56.780
if you have really complicated animations,
et cetera. These are contrived examples. It

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:02.920
is easy for us to come up with a demo. You
are trying to debug a site or an app on a

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.610
phone in production, there can be lots of
stuff going on. There can be all sorts of

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.230
layers all over the place. And you can be
trying to add more but that's only causing

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.640
you to have too many. Maybe you are running
out of memory. All sorts of things can go

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.490
wrong, right?
So Nat's going to talk a little bit about

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.380
what to do in those more advanced scenarios.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: What we are going to do now is

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.410
we're going to take the covers off of an internal
tool we have been developing in Chrome to

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:28.470
show the nasty innard guts of the compositing
system, which is this thing that makes things

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.010
Jankfree.
As you see this, keep in mind basically this

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.590
is very, very brand-new. And it is designed
for developers first, but we wanted to show

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:43.861
it because this shows you exactly why things
really are slow. The way it works is you get

00:24:43.861 --> 00:24:48.410
a relatively current build of Chrome and that
will probably be like Friday's build, not

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:54.340
today's. So that's how new it is. And you
pop over to your site that you think is Janky.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.710
So I'm just going to start with something
really simple. This is just a tall site with

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:05.059
some As in it, right? Really bringing out
the good content for you guys.

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:09.150
[ Laughter ]
Remember, we showed you the picture of Gmail,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:14.050
right, with it broken out in layers. You go
over to tracing, this Chrome tracing thing,

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.240
and you start it recording.
You go back over to here and you do your thing,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.790
whatever that thing happens to be. Just like
in Timeline.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.650
What you are going to be presented with, once
it does its thinking is something that should

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.760
actually remind some of you of Android systrace
in sort of appearance.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.750
What you are seeing here is these all the
different times my finger was moving on the

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.800
track pad causing it to scroll. And the nice
regularity of that that should scream out

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.150
Jankfreeness right away.
Each one of these green dots are the things

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:42.680
you really want to click on. Everything else
is sort of side show.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.530
The green dot represents Chrome drawing one
frame up onto the screen. That's kind of where

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:51.800
the meat is.
Down here you have got -- in the center here,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.110
you have got a list of the layers on the screen
on that frame. There's two. There is this

00:25:56.110 --> 00:26:00.040
one which is shown over here. You can see
that's the really tall page. You can see that's

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.390
the whole darn page.
Then you have got this thing which is tall

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.560
and narrow. What is that? That's the scroll
bar. It is that little thing. Even on Mac,

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.570
we have it, even though it is transparent.
That's sort of the shape of the page.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.921
The thing you want to then look at as I go
from frame to frame, see this thing over here,

00:26:16.921 --> 00:26:20.900
this is our mini map. As you go from frame
to frame, you see the green thing which is

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:26.320
the layer moving and that's the scroll happening.
The blue represents the viewport. So just

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.210
like in the Gmail example where we showed
the Gmail thing -- the mail list moving and

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.690
sort of this hole where the viewport was looking,
this is the same thing but from my live site.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.590
This is kind of -- you can sort of start thinking,
this is kind of useful.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:45.020
Hey, that's a big picture. I wonder how much
memory it is using. We have a lot of people

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.290
who worry about that, where they say, These
layer things are great but they are eating

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:51.830
a lot of memory.
You can actually click now on this and see

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:59.080
the actual bytes consumed by that layer. It
is like 7 megs, something like that.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.160
And I'm beeping. That was fun.
[ Laughter ]

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.490
So that's the most fun part of the talk.
You can actually get the actual memory consumption

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.680
from this tool, which is super useful when
you are trying to take your site which is

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:16.760
layer heavy, for instance, and bring it to
a phone, which is constrained. Remember, we

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:22.270
had this demo up, right? This drawer. And
Tom was saying, trust me, there is a layer

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.121
there. Don't trust, measure.
So we are going to reload. I'm going to set

00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:30.420
it to do the thing where it was popping in
and out and we are going to do the effect.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:36.070
Same old thing. And we wait for it to do a
bit of a think. You can see again there is

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.090
two big bursts of animation which is when
the rendering system was active.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.780
I click here. Let's pick that frame. You can
sort of see this, right?

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.250
There's my page as before, right? There is
the drawer on the left.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:53.770
And then there is this big stall here. It
is Jank. When I click here, you see that it

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:59.000
is gone. There is a hole. where did it go,
right? Now you see there are two layers instead

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.140
of one.
This is the root layer, and that's this newly

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.250
created one. And that got painted. We paid
to paint that and pop it out.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.110
And we also paid to paint the other layer
to create the hole.

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:15.060
Now you see on the left in the mini map that
drawer starting to slide in under the viewport.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.590
So now it is sliding in, sliding in and it
is good and we are happy and it is 60 hertz

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.040
and it looks smooth.
Toward the end, what you are going to see

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.720
is it smoosh down. So here -- from here to
here, you see that we have two layers like

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.050
this still. And then in the next frame, it
is smooshed down to one.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:37.140
Ah, right? So then we paid yet again to paint
it. We didn't pay so much of a painting penalty

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:41.220
this time, but maybe on a lower-end device,
we would have. If you scroll down, you can

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.350
see the painting activity taking place.
One other final thing to show about this tool.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:50.170
A lot of people wonder when you get a big
-- big site, big production site where there's

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:54.470
a zillion things going on, you get a ton of
layers. And you are like: I didn't ask for

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.290
this. Why is this layer promoted?
So if you actually look down at the bottom

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:05.130
of this thing, you can see this compositing
reason. This so no promotion reason given.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:11.100
But if I click on this one that's moving,
it is using accelerated animation. That's

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.290
your key to then start understanding, Hey,
maybe I should keep this promoted for some

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:20.360
other reason, too, so it stays promoted afterward.
And so when we turn this on and do a trace

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.030
of this with the real -- that final demo that
we say was Jankfree, you will see that, then,

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:29.090
has several promotion reasons that keep it
promoted the whole time.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.210
So this is sort of the low -- the quick glimpse
into a tool that we are trying to get out

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.330
there into people's hands so when you are
really under deadline and you need to make

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.920
something Jankfree that's in your available
in your arsenal to help with.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:48.490
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: It is as Nat said super, super
new. We have some nascent docs up at this

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.860
link. And we do encourage you guys to maybe
in the next couple weeks go try it out as

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.500
it lands and starts to stabilize.
But for sort of advanced use cases, this is

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.440
--
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: You can get very far with DevTools.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:04.701
This is if -- if you are in a pinch, you can
check this out. You will be confused, but

00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:07.960
it will help.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's right. But for starters,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.390
as you sort of begin down your journey towards
fighting Jank, you want to use DevTools. You

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.000
want to turn on Share Paint Rectangles every
time you see Jank sort of crop up in the wild.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.570
And you want to look for what is repainting
and try to figure out why.

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:28.090
You want to ask yourself why -- why am I repainting
this? And can I either avoid it by being judicious

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:33.730
and not changing style when I don't have to
or by using layers or some combination of

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.581
the above.
And if you can't avoid it, you want to make

00:30:35.581 --> 00:30:40.190
it as fast as possible by using continuous
painting mode that we talked about earlier.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.350
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: There are a lot of great tools.
The thing to keep in mind, if you walk away

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:49.910
with nothing else in your take-aways is this,
all the browsers are basically building something

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:54.380
around layers.
Think about doing your effects, your awesome

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:59.680
immersive Web experiences in terms of layers.
Think about whether you're designing for that,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.080
try to reduce paint.
And if you do, the browsers will pay you back

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.250
in scores with Jankfreeness, smoothness, right?
And if you don't, then you are going to be

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.080
fighting the browser. It is going to be doing
its best, but you are asking it to do a hard

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.010
thing. So happy Jank busting.
[ Laughter ]

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.490
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: I think we're going to take
a few questions because we have some time

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:24.120
left. But if you are hungry for more, we've
got sort of a collection of links and articles

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.650
and whatnot up at jankfree.org. It is just
sort of a dumping ground for us. And that's

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:30.360
where we are going to put these slides as
well.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.631
If you take away one URL from this talk, it
should be that. And you can get to everything

00:31:33.631 --> 00:31:37.460
else from there. Html5rocks is the Chrome
developer relations Website about this kind

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.250
of topic. So you should definitely go check
that out.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:45.250
We will continue putting up content about
this topic. Go check that out.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.590
Our contact info is up here, too. We are happy
to talk about things like this if you have

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:54.280
interesting cases that you want to sort of
bring to us. We also welcome bugs on the Chrome

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:59.330
bug tracker.
With that, I think we will take some questions.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:06.710
Thank you very much.
[ Applause ]

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:12.510
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. So it seems like layers are really
important. But right now, it seems like you

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:16.760
kind of have to do a snake dance to figure
out or make something into a layer.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.510
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: I like that expression.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Does it make sense for there to be an

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.690
explicit style declaration to say, Hey, I
know how I want to composite my page?

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.520
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me turn this into a layer, just like

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.020
Webkit layer, whatever, make this into a layer,
yeah, almost like Z index. Is that coming?

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.580
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Right. I mean, it is a good
question. It actually comes up a fair amount.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.040
It is something we've resisted because, like,
in general, there is resistance to adding

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.000
APIs to this.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: One of the great things about

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.130
the Web is that your content can run pretty
much anywhere. And, remember I showed you

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:59.210
in the demo that these layers take memory?
If you start telling Chrome to use a layer

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:03.240
for that, then you run into the situation
of it might fit on your high-end computer,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.960
say, a Pixel, but then it won't fit on an
Android device.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.250
And at which point, what are we to do? If
you start making assumptions about this definitely

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.820
being in a layer and we can't fit it in memory,
what are we going to do?

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.510
I totally get where you are coming from. This
is something that we as a community, the Web

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.210
community, need to really tackle in the next
couple of years, of how to improve the statement

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:24.140
of intent.
But we also have to think about as we do that,

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.880
how to make it work and preserve sort of that
promise of the Web where it just sort of works

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.710
everywhere. Does that --
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: I think the intent --

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:31.730
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Is that responsive?
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: The intent point is a good

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:36.480
one, right, because, like, in some ways, the
layer concept, like, it is kind of an implementation

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.470
detail. And that's not the kind of thing we
like to codify with syntax, right?

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:46.740
Instead what we want to codify is stuff about
intent, right? So things that, for instance,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:52.610
the Chrome Compositor is good at right now
is moving stuff around, changing opacity and

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:57.490
sort of doing this 60 times a second. And
there actually are semantic ways of declaring

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:01.950
all of these things. If you declare them,
Chrome will do the right thing. Those things

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.810
get layers and those things get hardware accelerated.
I think that's probably more the direction

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:12.280
we want to go. Otherwise, you will try to
end up in some senses abuse it, right? You

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.290
will try to trick the compositor into doing
things that it is not really designed ed for.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.580
I wonder -- I don't know. I wonder if we will
end up in a worse place --

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:23.200
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: TLDR hard problem. And if you
have any brilliant observations, come grab

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.419
us.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: We will be in the Chrome performance

00:34:25.419 --> 00:34:29.639
area later, too, if anyone wants to talk.
In the front.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:33.520
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was just wondering if this tool is available
on Chrome for Android?

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.270
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Sorry, can you repeat the
question?

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:42.090
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this tool available on Chrome for Android?
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: The last one will work on Chrome

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.940
eventually.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: All the DevTools stuff, yes.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.370
The last sort of advanced tracing tool doesn't
work yet.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.450
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: It will come.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: It should.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.800
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: It is all sort of common infrastructure.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: The basic tracing does work

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.100
on Android. The more advanced features to
view frames doesn't work.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.020
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Haven't tried it. It might work.
We'll see. But it is all one big happy family.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.280
We all think about all platforms.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: We work across.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.120
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: If it is not working today, it
will be working very soon because we want

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:15.130
-- our whole vision here is you write your
Web platform thing and we will take care of

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:22.290
all your OSes for you, module a few details.
&gt;&gt;&gt; So instead of asking for a layer, is there

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:28.230
a possibility of getting, like, an experimental
no-paint attribute, I'm sorry, suppress paint

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:33.370
while we move stuff around? Because sometimes
it is kind of like you have to hold the old-style

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:39.160
TV antenna up to get the right -- it is like:
Did I do the right thing to kick the compositor

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.920
just the right way?
If we had attributes that, seriously, we actually

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.940
know better than you, don't repaint this,
it might help some edge cases we have.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:53.060
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: There is a proposal floating around
for, I believe we are calling it, prepainting.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:58.110
And if you look on one of chromium's graphics
development mailing lists, you will find a

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:03.760
discussion about it. And I think we intend
to broaden that discussion in the coming months.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.500
But this is about being able to say, hey,
I'm bringing -- So, think about infinite scroll.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:13.760
You are adding elements to the bottom. Hey,
Chrome or, hey, browser, I'm adding this image

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:20.190
but, like, if you can't put that up in time,
no big. I'll put in a placeholder or something.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.870
So, hey, this is optional. And please let
me know when it really is there so I can get

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:27.330
rid of my placeholder asset.
That's being discussed. I think it may be

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.930
abusable for the other things you are thinking
about, too. That actually feels relatively

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:36.500
within scope of the platform, I think. We'll
see.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.500
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: I think there is also room
to do that kind of thing higher up the stack

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.350
before we talk about painting. Like, really
what you want to do is declare -- is sort

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:51.230
of make a promise to the browser that you're
not going to do anything that's going to manipulate

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:55.490
style or layout inside of -- sort of a container
block.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:37:00.950
If you can do that, then, like, further down
the stack where we are talking about, we can

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.280
do the right thing and not paint.
But there is some efforts going around things

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.980
like that, too.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: There is a lot of discussion here.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:09.680
We're definitely -- please, come on up and
we can chat if you want. There is a lot of

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.930
discussion in the team about how to basically
say to the platform, Hey, I solemnly swear

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:20.210
I'm up to good. Now get out of my way. We
know it is not good enough yet.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.370
&gt;&gt;&gt; Any love for SVG -- Jankfree SVG any time
soon?

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:27.350
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Oh, totally. Definitely. One of
the people helping build that tool that we

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:34.310
demoed is one of our SVG awesome peoples.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Definitely important. The

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:39.290
summary is yes. It is a little harder because
of the way SVG works. Gloss over that.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.820
In front.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Jankfree is awesome especially considering

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.130
how poor performance still is six years into
smartphones on smartphones.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.600
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Totally.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But I can't help but look at these demos

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.820
with "Oh, make this translate and then make
this a 3D translate" and think about people

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.980
who used underscores for their CSS variables
to make IE7 not look at that one and look

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.240
at a different one.
It feels like we are introducing another Web

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.280
development snake dance. And I wonder if there
is anything we can do to mitigate that to

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.020
make -- to think about our codebases as something
that's going to live for longer than the six

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.230
months that I'm on this project and make it
easy for people to maintain down the line.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:18.330
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Absolutely. That's kind of
the reason that we were saying what we were

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:24.860
in response to the first question about, like,
Oh, can we have a primitive for layer promotion?

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.450
And the reason that there is hesitancy to
do that kind of thing is because again so

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.760
directly targeting implementation details
of the browser, you end up in a world of pain

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.410
later where, oh, I don't care about IE7 so
much anymore but now my codebase is all kind

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.030
of split up because of that.
That's the kind of thing we don't want to

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.500
do. We want to stay as semantic as possible
so future versions of the browser don't need

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:52.480
to handle these kind of weird cases that were
targeted very much at implementation.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.211
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: But if there is one thing to keep
in the back of your head, it's this. Probably

00:38:56.211 --> 00:39:00.430
for the next couple of years it is going to
be messy. So having your infrastructure on

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:05.460
your project be set up to deliver custom CSS
or in some way handle special casing for different

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.810
browsers is probably the unfortunate reality
of our platform at this time.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:13.600
That really stinks and we all know we need
to do better. But you find quirks that you

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:19.190
need to apply for Safari different than, say,
Chrome, that are different from the old Android

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:24.580
Web view or something like that.
I would plan for the possibility of needing

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.340
to do that.
How are we doing? We got probably one more

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.420
question.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: One more minute.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:36.000
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Especially as we are long winded.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. You talked about permanent vigilance.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.580
Can you tell us how Google internally spots
these? Whether you have got automation tools

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:46.220
to assess when things have got worse so that
we cannot depend on developers being vigilant

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.500
because they will be distracted by other things
as well?

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.770
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Yeah, sure, Nat built some
of them. So I will let him --

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:57.870
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: What we are starting to use, Go
Google Chrome telemetry. It is a framework

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:03.680
built in Python on top of DevTools protocol.
So DevTools has this fantastic JSON-level

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.480
-- or Web socket and then JSON-level protocol
where you can talk to the Web page out of

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:13.410
process. And you can build developer tools
on top of it. You can also build fantastic

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:18.510
profiling tools and you can get out of Timeline
stream in that the painting info of what was

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:22.590
painting then you can build all sorts of cool
stuff on that, one of which is telemetry.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.850
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: That's the harness. And then
we have sort of collections of Web content

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:32.190
that are sort of interesting cases for whatever
reason that we're worried about improving

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:38.260
performance of or aggressing performance against.
We run sort of banks of content with this

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.890
harness, and we have performance waterfalls.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Thank you.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.720
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: So hopefully that is compelling.
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Thanks, everybody, so much for

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720
coming.
&gt;&gt;Tom Wiltzius: Yeah.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.059
&gt;&gt;Nat Duca: Good luck dejanking.
