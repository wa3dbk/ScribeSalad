00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.880
FEMALE SPEAKER: So now we're
going to shift, and we're

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:10.270
going to hear an amazing talk by
a hardware lead at Google.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.150
Jean Wang has a PhD
in electrical

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.670
engineering in photonics.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.880
She worked in the optical
communications and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.690
then came to Google.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.270
She's the hardware lead
on Google Glass.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.440
As a board member, I
have Google Glass.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.790
I love it.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.420
It's so much more natural
than a phone.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690
And now you get to hear about
how she did this.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.200
Thank you.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.050
JEAN WANG: Hi, everybody.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.300
Smile.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380
So I'm very happy to be
here with you today.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.000
I'd like to share with
you my Glass journey.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.050
It's a three-part story that
spans across multiple domains.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.160
And while it is yet unfinished,
I hope you share

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.270
my enthusiasm for what
is yet to come.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.360
Before diving in, I'd actually
like to float this number

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.550
briefly and plant it
in your minds.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.870
It has significance to me and
the story, and in the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.360
meantime, please feel free
to question the number

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.610
base that I'm using.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.160
So, Glass, like many ideas,
started as a blank canvas.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.280
As part of the initial team,
we came into the project

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.750
largely inexperienced
in the field of

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.420
head-mounted displays.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.510
Instead, we had the ability to
divide and conquer through our

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.120
ability to learn and adapt.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.250
While some of us focused on
optics, like myself, others

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.370
worked on cameras, sensor
systems, electronics.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.390
And so we also came in with the
fundamental belief that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.110
technology had ripened to the
point where we can make a

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.860
significant impact and create
something of significant use.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.080
And that has led us into the
discovery phase, to find out

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.650
just what it was that could be
done to basically minimize the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.000
barrier to information access,
and to make us connect with

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.250
each other in terms of accessing
our social sphere.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.820
As part of the discovery
process, we looked at existing

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.200
products in the mobile space
and wanted to really

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.280
understand where it was that we
can make an impact in terms

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.790
of form factor.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.890
For example, whether it was
bulky and had to fit into our

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.930
pocket or carry around a bag
for it; ease of access,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.820
whether we had to pull it out
of our pocket or a bag to

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.580
actually engage with it; and
also ease of use, whether we

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.780
were blocked when we were using
the device, or whether

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.310
we could look straight ahead and
talk with people and not

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.990
be distracted.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.080
So to push on these pain points,
we did a number of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.630
technical experiments.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.120
Here's a helmet-mounted display
that did not allow us

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.670
to be hands free
or wires free.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.130
And in the bottom, you can see
here, is an early optical

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.260
experiment to help us understand
the technical

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.620
complexities in terms of how
optics sizes actually impact

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.570
the performance and
the image quality.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.650
So with these considerations
in mind, we dived into

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.140
selecting components that
we could use to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.390
make a viable solution.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.690
So in the vast array of options,
we looked at what it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.910
was we could just reuse
and customize.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.020
Or was there something that we
had to invent for ourselves?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.980
So we played around with a bunch
of pico projectors and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.990
projectors.

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.250
We looked at optic components
such as lenses and prisms as

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.650
well as interface devices--

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.020
touch pads, microphones,
speakers.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.410
And underpinning the whole
system was electrical

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.250
components and board design.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.790
So in this huge selection of
choices and huge array of

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.350
options, how do we
down-select?

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.540
And so we filtered using
two key criteria.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.020
One was power consumption,
and a second was weight.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.800
So these two are basically
factors in enabling us to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.840
first, wear a system all day,
and second, actually allow us

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.890
to want to wear a
system all day.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.295
So we headed into the second
phase of prototyping.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.410
Here are six example generations
of glass

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.810
prototypes.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.200
Starting at the very top left,
we took the lowest hanging

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.585
fruit of simply putting mobile
phones to the side of the

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:17.720
head, and a pico projector
shining directly into the eye

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.450
to provide the image.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.100
And so this was a bit bulky,
as you can imagine.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.750
It came in at 167 grams.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.300
And we wisely decided that we
could lighten the load by

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.010
taking the mechanicals
off the phone.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.860
And that's our second proto
shown right up there in the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.320
middle top.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.460
And so as you can see, over
time, we shifted from using

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.250
off-the-shelf components, such
as safety shields and frames,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.610
into 3D printing
our own frame.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.160
And that's shown here
in the third.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.060
And you can also see that we
migrated into making our own

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.540
optical design and architecture,
which is

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.880
something we carry
through today.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.310
And as you gradually evolve to
the very end, you see that

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.660
more and more we use customized
components.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.920
And we look at making our own
plastics and metals to get to

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.520
where we are today, which is
essentially the essence of

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.400
what Glass needs to be.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.440
This provides the core, and
provides a very minimalistic

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.940
system, that allows us to run
around and be happy when we're

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.722
playing with the system.

00:05:12.722 --> 00:05:16.340
And in addition to prototyping
with the hardware, Glass

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.940
derives its use from
easy to follow UI.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.760
And this is by definition
actually easy to make.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.850
Along the way, we experimented
with a number of different

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.440
interaction concepts, for
example, head gestures.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.700
And that recent SNL skit was not
too far from our previous

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.960
truth, if you've seen it.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.640
Also, we experimented with
porting the keyword

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.950
functionality to the touchpad.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.720
But we found that was a bit too
complex, even when running

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.670
in a predictive word mode.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.210
We also tuned the number
of lines of text--

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.330
the font, the size--

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.470
to basically optimize
for readability.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.010
So through all of these
things, we found that

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.350
minimalizing and stripping down
to the very core allowed

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.050
for the best use case
and experience.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.740
We also found that minor head
tilts and voice commands

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.580
allowed us for hands-free
experience, which is very

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.270
important when we're
busy dancing or

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.090
riding that roller coaster.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.930
On the flip side, having the
touchpad and the camera button

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.920
allowed us for more quiet
modes of interaction.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.080
So with the hardware and
software solutions converging

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.840
into a viable state, the team
actually turned to the

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.790
question of production.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.480
It is possible to manually tweak
and baby one device, to

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.430
get it to be close to ideal
in terms of cosmetics and

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.110
functionality.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.460
However, we'd like to share
Glass more broadly.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.850
And so that, to us,
quickly turns into

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.930
the question of scale.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.500
How do we build not 1, 1,000,
100,000, but upward towards a

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.392
googol of devices?

00:06:55.392 --> 00:06:58.290
Layering in automation
is key to this.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.250
And that means that not only
do we have to build Glass

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.590
itself, but we have to build

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.930
infrastructure that builds Glass--

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.030
this floor space, the
equipment, the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.250
whole kit and caboodle.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.250
And to add a bit more
complexity, we'd like to honor

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.250
individuality and human
preferences.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:23.160
And that to us, has meant color
options, and that leads

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.280
to color complexity.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.930
How do we make sure that on
the device itself, part to

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.700
part, the colors match?

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.830
And how do we make
sure that between

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.880
devices the colors match?

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.030
So production requires the
solutions to all of these

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.760
questions and beyond.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.250
Through these three phases of
discovery, prototyping, and

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.680
production, I have found that
Glass is both an innovation

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.930
and a reinvention.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.410
By integrating highly compact
and new components, we've been

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.820
able to extend far beyond nickel
head-mounted displays,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.840
beyond the last couple decades
of individualized movie

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.330
players, game consoles,
and aircraft systems.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.930
On other hand, I think that
Glass is a way in which we can

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.840
examine and develop new fields
that we can push beyond and

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.000
learn to be better connected to
each other as well as share

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.620
perspective and have access
to information.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.870
And all of this will allow us to
better empathize as people

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.360
and sympathize.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.670
So coming back to that number
at the very beginning.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.760
It's been exactly, as
of today, 1,111

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.510
days since I joined.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.330
And this is a picture I
would not be able to

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.220
take without Glass.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.530
I am paragliding over Coronet
Peak, New Zealand.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.020
And just by looking at it, I can
recall what it was like to

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.670
soar with the birds
and to take in the

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.100
beauty of the landscape.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.955
I have often been asked what the
a-ha moments have been in

00:08:50.955 --> 00:08:52.520
the project thus far.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.500
And while I have a few, I
am more excited about

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.300
what is yet to come.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.410
There is a first tier, for
example, a bar code, QR code

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.850
scans, where we can get
just-in-time reviews of

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.560
movies, books, that menu trace
we're just about to take, but

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.360
we're not quite sure yet.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.850
Then there's also never getting
lost and not bumping

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.870
into things while you're
looking at directions.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:17.270
And then there's a whole
other level.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.910
Recently one of my colleagues
exchanged his wedding vows

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.540
while wearing the device.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.100
And I get goose bumps when I
imagine him reliving that when

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.650
he is old and gray and seeing
the reflection of a future

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.330
from his wife's eyes.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.210
And then there's also a
physics instructor who

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.980
recently toured CERN
with the device.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.240
And he did a Hangout back to
his classroom in Michigan.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.030
And he was riding his bike down
the tunnel of the Large

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.700
Hadron Collider showing his
classroom just how cool it

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.820
was, while taking live questions
on the spot.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.840
Then there's also another
example where Glass can mean

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.540
life or death, that it can
help you translate to a

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.290
medical doctor in a foreign
country that you're allergic

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.540
to penicillin.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:08.450
So through this process, I think
that there's just so

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.140
much potential in what is yet
to come, that in pushing

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.320
towards a new perspective on
information sharing and

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.910
perspective sharing, we've come
upon a new environment

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.630
Glass can engender.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:28.720
And when I have time to pause
and think about how far we've

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.400
come, I feel privileged to be
part of such a dynamic team.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.410
Together we're striving forth
to bring forward this new

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:36.980
perspective.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.610
And I count you, as developers,
as part of this

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.570
growing group.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.630
There's just so much potential
and positive impact in keeping

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.170
in the moment, where information
is just at your

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.650
fingertips and knowledge is
a twinkle in your eye.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.730
And with that I look forward
to your aha moments, and we

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.200
are back to discovery.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.650
JEAN WANG: Thanks everyone.
