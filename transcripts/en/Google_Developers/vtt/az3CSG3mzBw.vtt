00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.600
ARDAN ARAC: OK.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.130
Well, welcome to our session.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.660
We're very excited to
have you here today.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.620
And I know it's late in the
afternoon, so you're probably

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.520
pretty tired.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.990
But we have some truly exciting
stuff to show you.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.840
Today, we're going to show you
how you can transform your

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.900
brand queries on
Google search.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.190
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And we're going
to do that through the

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.580
power of the Google+ API,
Google+ pages, as well as the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.860
Google+ Sign-In API and
related technologies.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.420
ARDAN ARAC: I'm Ardan from
the search team.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.860
I'm a product manager.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.310
And in the first half of the
talk, I'll be walking you

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.005
through the user experience,
and what is possible.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:35.960
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And I'm John.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.140
I'm an engineer on Google+.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.970
And I'm going to, in the second
half of the talk, tell

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.320
you how you can actually
implement this, and in fact,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.690
get your part of the equation
rolling today, in as little as

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.770
half an hour, to provide
this integration.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.130
ARDAN ARAC: Today, we'll be
mostly talking about a class

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.640
of queries that I call
brand queries.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.080
These are queries like
Audi, NBC, Fandango--

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.900
people coming to Google and
searching directly for you.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.550
So the first question
to address is,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.610
why should you care?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.200
People are already
looking for you.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.990
Who cares what the Google
results page looks like?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.930
Well, for many of your users,
current and prospective,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.870
Google is the first interaction

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.610
point for your brand.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.370
On the internet, it's not really
your home page where

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.990
you make the first impression.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.230
It's the Google search
results page.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.510
And this is what the page looks
like for a lot of you.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.300
And this is a very great page.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.650
It's very useful, gets
the job done.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.990
But today, we'll show you
how you can get to this.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.230
The first thing that strikes me
when I look at this is how

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.810
much more beautiful it
is, more visual.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.900
The logo is there.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.630
The movie posters are there.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.570
Before, and after--

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.800
but it's not just pretty
for prettiness' sake.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.150
It's also very useful.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.950
At Google, we're all about
relevance and bringing useful

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.350
content to the users.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530
So let's think about
the use case here.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.120
I come to Google searching
for Fandango.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.710
On the right hand side, I see
the most popular movies that

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.350
are trending on Fandango across
their website or mobile

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.420
app right now.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.140
So the fact that "Oblivion" is
the top movie, it's pretty

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.860
likely that I too am interested
in "Oblivion," or

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.980
one of those four movies
we're showcasing here.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.840
So my eye goes there.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.160
My mouse goes there, and I
click on it, and here.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.840
I'm on "Oblivion"'s page on
Fandango, ready to complete my

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.240
transaction.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.780
It is so much faster.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.280
And if beauty and efficiency and
relevance don't convince

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.620
you, perhaps math will.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.150
Here, you doubled your footprint
on Google's search

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.470
results page.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.470
You doubled the number of
links pointing to your

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.150
website, and you supplemented
the page with even more

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.220
relevant links relevant now.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.040
Here's another example.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.090
Let's say I heard about TuneIn
last night from John.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.295
He mentioned he uses it.

00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:05.300
He loves it.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.730
I barely remember what it was or
why he liked it, so I come

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.030
and Google it.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.980
This is what I would
see today, but this

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.290
is also what's possible.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.740
The first thing, the
logo is there.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.830
So maybe it rings a bell.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.150
Maybe I remember seeing
TuneIn elsewhere.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.460
If not that, underneath
it, I see CNN's logo.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.960
I see BBC radio.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.930
I immediately you start to
understand TuneIn is where

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.460
people go and listen to
these radio stations.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.690
6,000 people seem to be
listening to CNN.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.910
As in the example of Fandango,
if I click on one of these

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.950
links, I'm on the right page,
ready to consume the content.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.250
There's also another point
I want to make here.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.250
Everything you see in this
card comes from TuneIn.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.880
It is specified by TuneIn.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.500
So basically, since the clicks
go to TuneIn, we want to give

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.850
as accurate a representation of
those pages that we'll be

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.100
taking the user to
as possible here.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.950
So the logos, the text, the
descriptions, all come from

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.580
schema.org markups.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.440
And John will be getting
into the weeds later.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.260
Let's take a closer look.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.880
So we talked about the logo that
comes from the Google+

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.240
profile page.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.140
But there's also the follow
button that allows the users

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.760
to follow your brand directly
from search.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.459
And why does that matter?

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.110
First of all, you're building
a relationship.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.270
You're building a community.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.670
So from this point on, any post
that you post on your

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.660
Google+ profile will appear
in that user's stream.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.860
But there's also another
point here.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.900
As a search team, we now know
that this user cares about

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:38.325
your brand.

00:04:38.325 --> 00:04:41.580
There is an explicit signal
that they gave us

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.100
by following you.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.030
So that goes way deeper than
just the brand query.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.860
Having that kind of an explicit
signal, explicit

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.550
affirmation from the user that
they like you, that's the type

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.480
of thing we love and integrate
into search.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.360
So building a follower base
is a general good to have.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.230
That pays many dividends
down the stream.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.910
We didn't talk about recent
posts, so I want to spend a

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.840
little bit of time
on this one.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.410
So this is the voice of your
brand coming from your Google+

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.790
page in realtime on
search results.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.480
So when would that be useful?

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.290
How about product launches
or product announcements?

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.770
We all work towards these big
milestones where we announce

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.000
something and we want everyone
to hear about it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.590
So in this case, BMW, who has
launched a new customization

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.590
tool for their interior design,
puts a post about that

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.020
launch, about that announcement,
right on Google.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.970
And perhaps the reason someone
is searching for BMW on that

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.840
particular day is because they
heard about this through a

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.080
different channel.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.160
And there's that nice blue link,
and clicking on it goes

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.540
to this nice album posted
on Google+.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.200
However, all links don't
need to go to Google+.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.730
That's not the point.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.000
For some announcements, maybe
the appropriate link is to the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.750
page on your website.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.600
So here, with Verizon's
announcement, the link doesn't

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.420
go to Google+.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.830
For BMW, that made sense.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.020
They wanted that visual
experience.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.910
But for Verizon, they want to
maybe sell the product.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.305
So they included a link
to their product page.

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:18.450
Examples are really endless, but
I want to walk you through

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.950
a couple others.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.380
So you can also use this
to upload all kinds of

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.570
interesting, relevant, timely
information, such as events

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.790
that you're hosting.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.920
You can also use it to post
realtime updates from the

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.440
events themselves.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.620
Or perhaps promotions, coupons,
daily deals--

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.960
but here's another one that
I really like, and this

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.090
emphasizes the realtime nature
of this integration.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.750
So every once in a while,
something unexpected happens,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.840
and that you want to deal with--
like, say something

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.630
about, with urgency.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.740
In this example, perhaps
something happened in your

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.740
local community, and you want to
get your message across as

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.220
quickly as possible.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.480
Well, this is a great
distribution system.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.470
You can--

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.920
as the CEO of the company, or
the PR person, marketing

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.010
person, whoever--

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:10.530
type up a post from your mobile
phone, hit send, and

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.830
within less than a minute, that
message is going to be on

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.460
Google's search results page
for people looking for you.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.270
And here, maybe you make direct
eye contact with the

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.340
user who's searching for
you with your written

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.480
message next to it.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.660
And not everything has to
have a time component.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.110
All the examples I walk through
were about events,

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.160
promotions, et cetera.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.600
But sometimes, you just want
to show the best of their

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.850
pages, best of your content,
with pretty pictures, on

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.100
search results page.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.380
And this is the last section
I want to talk about.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.650
I already alluded to it at
the beginning of my talk.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.610
We are just beginning to release
this new module that

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.390
shows people who are looking
for you, what is popular,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.650
what's trending on
your site or app.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.200
Well, how do we know
what's popular?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.340
Google+ platform team released
Sign-In with Google

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.050
functionality that I hope all
of you are considering or

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.790
adopting to your website
and mobile app.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.790
So users come and login with
their Google ID to your

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.780
service, be it on mobile
or desktop.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.160
Then with their consent, you
can send us the activities

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.180
that those users are
engaged in--

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.220
the songs that are being
listened or the movies that

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.800
are being purchased.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.130
So then, one of the first
integration points of this

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.860
data into Google search is
what I'm showing here.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.309
We aggregate all those
activities, find out what is

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.750
trending right now, and then
put links into them with

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.630
accurate descriptions coming
from your web pages into these

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.120
right hand side cards.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.410
So Google+ Sign-In is--

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.840
basically, we will be having a
lot more integrations on top

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.620
of Google+ Sign-In, and this is
the first starting point.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.370
So with that, I hand over to
John, who will be talking you

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.620
through how to get to
these features.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:03.040
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's right.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.760
Thank you, Ardan.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.790
So this is a really exciting
opportunity to actually have

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.870
the ability to have your voice,
as well as the voice of

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.550
your users, on your Google
search results page for your

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.640
brand query.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.160
And that's almost
unprecedented.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.620
In fact, actually, it
is unprecedented.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.460
And you might think
to yourself, how

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.390
can I make this happen?

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.120
And the great news is that
it's incredibly easy.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.210
I'm going to describe today
two different levels of

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.220
integration that you can do.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.430
One is so simple that within
the span of half an hour's

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.430
worth of time today while
sitting in Google I/O, you can

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.250
get your portion of this ball
rolling to activate the right

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.840
hand search box to begin with.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:44.520
All that involves is having an
activated +Page that also has

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.930
current posts that have been
posted quite recently on it.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.460
The second level of integration
that I'm going to

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.940
describe is integrating
Google+ Sign-In.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.700
Google+ Sign-In, in turn, as
Ardan mentioned, allows you to

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.910
send activities with the user's
consent to Google,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.680
which we in turn can pass back
to you in the form of

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.830
promotion in the right hand
search box on the popular

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.950
Google+ box.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.620
Let's get into the details.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.210
First level of integration is
what I call basic integration.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.760
All you need to do to activate
the right hand search box is

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.100
to have a Google+ that you've
created that claims a website

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.255
that corresponds to your
Google+ brand query--

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.460
excuse me, your Google
brand query.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.990
And then that page in turn will
have validation code on

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.620
at that points back to your
+Page to ensure that the +Page

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.170
is yours and you
are the +Page.

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.500
The second level of
integration is

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.310
to integrate Google+.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.030
You integrate Google+ to tell us
who is doing activities on

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.690
your site, what those activities
are, and then with

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.430
the help of schema.org, you'll
be able to tell Google's

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.370
search engine more about the
page, such that we can render

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.930
something relevant and
contextual for the user.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.380
So let's dive right on in.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:00.070
First thing to do is
to set up a +Page.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.360
Many people here have probably
already done so, but if you

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.140
haven't, it's incredibly
simple.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.540
You simply just go to Home,
Pages, Add a Page, and you'll

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.710
go through a very easy
to follow flow.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.830
And I'll walk through some of
the most relevant fields

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.610
associated with that.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.040
There's quite a few others,
many of them quite

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.840
self-explanatory.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.650
So in this case, we're talking
about a product or a brand in

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.980
terms of classification.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:22.680
And you'll give your product
a brand type.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.500
The two fields that are
most relevant are the

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.560
most obvious ones.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.470
One is your name--

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:28.670
pretty straightforward.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.810
That name will show up directly,
prominently, and in

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:35.930
large text in the right hand
search box on the top.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.280
The second is your website.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.010
The website is what
you were claiming

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.320
corresponds to that +Page--

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.560
pretty straightforward.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.590
For best results for that +Page,
execute your brand

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.380
query directly yourself, and
simply just copy and paste.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.750
Make sure that there's a
one-to-one correspondence.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.140
It might not necessarily be
absolutely required, but to

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:58.440
make things easy, just
copy the URL directly

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.480
into the claim box.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.600
That's fairly simple.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.130
The last stage, which I don't
show on this slide, is simply

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.830
just to have your
profile image.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.490
The profile image is what
shows up in the top left

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.740
portion of the right
hand search box.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.080
So that's great.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.520
At this point, you
have a +Page.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.000
You've claimed the page
that corresponds

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.090
to your brand query.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.710
That's not quite enough, because
of course, anybody

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.790
could do that.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.760
The last thing you need to do
is add code your page itself

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.000
that validates that that
page is yours.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.640
Now there's a number of
different ways to do this, and

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.535
previous talks actually today,
including Paul Linner and

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:34.340
Chris [? Macinez, ?]

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.970
having to do with our new
Badges, provide some

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.050
techniques to do that.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.480
The first technique that I'm
going to describe is to add a

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.750
widget to your page.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.760
And the widget could either be
a Brand Badge, which we see

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.080
here on the right, or a Follow
button, which you also see

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.620
here on the right.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.940
The Brand Badge is a
beautiful, small

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.280
representation of your +Page
that you can embed

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.400
anywhere on your site.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.090
But if it happens to be on your
home page, Google search

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.820
crawler will see this
and take that as

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.870
validation of the page itself.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.520
The same is true for
the Follow button.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.670
The Follow button is a lighter
weight version of this.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.890
You'll notice that Follow
exists in the

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.490
Brand Badge as well.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.930
And Follow provides yet another
way that you can embed

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.690
anywhere in your site, but in
particular, on your claimed

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:17.090
page, to indicate that the +Page
is yours, and to allow

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.050
users the ability
to establish a

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.240
relationship with you by following.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.080
And then finally, if none of
these work for your particular

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.990
UX reasons or others, you can
simply just add a link tag,

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.570
which has no UX associated
with it whatsoever, or a

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:34.570
direct link to your +Page.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.580
Once Google search crawlers
crawl your page, they will see

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.830
this and take this as
validation, at which point

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.850
you're pretty much done.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.600
How do you know that
this has happened?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.960
You go back to your +Page, and
then take note of the URL here

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.910
for TuneIn.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.260
If there's a small check boxes
just to the right of it,

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.830
Google's crawlers have
found, crawled, and

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.330
validated your page.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.870
At this point, you're completely
done, and you can

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.890
activate the right hand
search box simply by

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:02.140
adding Activated Posts--

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.350
excuse me, Active Posts, which
is the last stage in the basic

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.290
integration--

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.150
very simple.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.300
It's the same as posting a share
or a post your personal

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.510
stream, only, of course, it
corresponds to your +Page.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.190
Now, there are two requirements
associated with

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.200
posts that are required
to trigger the

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.470
right hand search box.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.360
The absolute requirement is
that you have some text.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.630
We need to provide additional
information in context.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.600
But of course, it is strongly
recommend as well to either

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.680
have a link or an image.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.890
The image will be displayed
directly on the page,

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:38.620
providing that it can
be, of course.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.080
And then if you provide a link,
Google's crawlers will

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.720
crawl that link, find an image
from it, and display that as

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.250
well in the right hand side.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.220
And here we have a couple
of examples.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.790
TuneIn is promoting a Deadmau5
concert with a link.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:58.420
That link was crawled on
TuneIn's website, and the

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.410
image appeared accordingly.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.920
In the second particular
example, an image was provided

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.540
directly, which corresponds
to the text.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.240
And that's pretty much it.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.270
It's incredibly simple.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.050
And like I said, your portion
of this can be done in as

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.220
little as 15, 30 minutes today,
simply by starting up

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.550
your +Page, claiming it, and
then providing validation.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.170
Google search crawlers
will do the rest.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.120
So before and after is an
incredibly powerful

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.110
demonstration of this technique
and this technology.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.960
So from here, I'm going to
talk about the deeper

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.470
integration.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.960
And this is something that, as
Ardan mentioned, is already

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.820
paying dividends, but is
becoming more and more

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.190
powerful as we continue to add
features of the Google+

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.440
Sign-In platform.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.180
And this involves integrating
Google+ Sign-In, and then

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.220
sending app activities with
users' consent to Google,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.260
indicating activity that is
going on on your site.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.120
Now, thinking about this in a
very straightforward fashion,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.730
if you look at the Popular on
Google+ side, we need to know

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.850
how many users are doing
something, and what they're

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.580
doing, and then to be able
to represent that.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.660
Corresponds to three concepts.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.290
First of all, who's
on your site?

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:12.390
This is conferred by adding
Google+ Sign-In to your site.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.360
Second, sending app
activities--

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.200
what is the user doing,
and on what page--

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.380
which is represented as a URL,
which we'll see in details--

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.000
does that activity apply?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.030
And then third, Google's
crawlers

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.270
will crawl those URLs.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.340
And you can provide a way using
schema.org to tell us

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.580
how to best render that content,
so that when the user

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.380
sees it in Popular on Google+,
will get an accurate

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.750
representation of where
they're about to go.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.790
Let's dive into the details.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.220
First thing to do is to
integrate Google+ Sign-In.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.170
Now, there are a number of
different talks in Google I/O

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.180
today that will give you
a lot of the details .

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.170
And it's important to recognize
that you can do this

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.850
for web, Android, or I/O.
Everything that applies to

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.050
this talk has to do it either
web- or app-related

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.450
activities.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.570
For the purposes of the
discussion today, I'm going to

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.190
go through the web flow just
as an example, just to show

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.220
you how simple it will be.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.000
However, there are a number of
different talks, all of which

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.630
are tomorrow--

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.460
a deep dive into integration on
web, Android, and iOS-- and

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.666
I strongly encourage you to
check out any of them if they

00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:18.640
are of interest to you.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.630
So the first thing to do in
integrating to a Google+

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.140
Sign-In into a webpage
is to add the

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.859
Google+ JavaScript snippet.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.490
And this activates all APIs
that Google+ supports.

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.220
This includes +1, Brand
Badge, Follow widget.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.000
It also allows you access to the
Google+ Client, with which

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.920
you can send activities
to Google.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.250
It's a pretty straightforward
piece of boilerplate that you

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.000
more or less just copy
and paste once

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.380
onto any given page.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.500
And then from there, what you
would like to do is add a

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.780
Google+ Sign-In widget.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.070
The widget is activated, as
all other widgets on the

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.420
Google+ platform are, with a
small snippet of HTML5 markup.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.060
This provides an example
of the Sign-In widget.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.160
As you'll notice, it's
simply just a span

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.250
which has a class g-signin.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.960
All widgets have class equals
g dash something.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.740
And in this case, it's
a Sign-In widget.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.620
I'll go through a couple of the
other parameters that are

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.930
relevant to this integration,
as well as all integrations

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.260
that have to do with Sign-In,
just to give you a little more

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.450
flavor for the important factors
that are involved in

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:18.600
integration.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.990
And the first one is the
callback parameter.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.310
In the case of web, when a user
goes through a Sign-In

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.140
flow, a JavaScript function
is executed with the

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.460
result of that flow.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.100
And what you need to know
is simply one thing.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.180
Was it successful?

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.930
And if it was successful, at
that point, you can start

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.960
sending app activities
back to Google.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.490
Let's take a look at
what the JavaScript

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:41.180
function will look like.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.150
This is very simple.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:43.810
And of course, we can
go into more detail.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.650
I recommend that you go to the
web talk tomorrow, or watch it

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.320
on stream if you'd like.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.530
Here, we're defining
a function called

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.440
handleAuthResult.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.350
It takes in a result object.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.880
For the purposes of the
function, it simply just looks

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.670
like a standard object.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.400
And it either has as
one of two fields.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.520
Access token--

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:05.820
if that token exists, the flow
was executed successfully, and

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.920
you can start making requests,
which we indicate here via

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.960
simple Boolean.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.540
There's a number of
ways to do that.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.630
If there's an error, you can log
it, and there's a number

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.560
of different other things that
you can do, which you can hear

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.990
about tomorrow.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.360
Second field is Client ID.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.340
Your application or site needs
to be able to identify itself

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.590
to Google uniquely so that
we know what app or site

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.590
corresponds to the activities.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.100
And that's done through the
use of a Client ID.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:37.090
You can set up your Client ID
at cloud.google.com/console,

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.620
and then click Register App.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.530
You'll go through a flow, of
which I've shown a couple of

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.850
details here, that allows you
to select the type of app or

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.180
site that you're talking about,
and then add certain

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.860
metadata associated with it.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.190
In the case of a web
application, all you need to

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.530
do is indicate that it is a web
application, and then copy

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.010
and paste in all the host
origins on which

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.150
your script may exist.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.500
Between the two of these,
Google's APIs will be able to

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.180
validate that the client ID is
legitimate, and then therefore

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.570
know who your app is
and who you are.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.950
Finally, I'll talk about this
requestvisibleactions field

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.260
just to call out again that all
these activities that you

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.170
post on behalf of your users are
done with their consent.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.720
When you pass
requestvisibleactions equals

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.030
this value to Google, what it
does is triggers the consent

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.100
dialogue to ask the user, is
it all right for us to send

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.010
activities on your behalf?

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.320
Supposing they consent, your
JavaScript callback will get

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.220
an access token.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.306
And from there you can start
sending activities.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:43.820
So finally, let's talk about
what it looks like to actually

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.760
send those activities.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.410
And this is also very simple,
so simple that the amount of

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.530
JavaScript necessary can
fit on one slide with

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.160
fairly large text.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.750
There are two pieces associated
with this.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.110
One, there's a simple "if"
conditional that says, was the

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.800
sign-in flow successful
to begin with?

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.480
And there's a number of
different pieces of logic you

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.780
can put in there, depending
on your integration.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.860
But most importantly,
you create a moment.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.140
The Google Moments API allows
you to send different types of

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.930
what we call moments-- in this
particular case, an activity--

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:11.880
to Google.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.340
There are only two pieces of
data associated with an

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.460
activity that are absolutely
required-- one, the type.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.520
There are a number of
different types.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.062
In this particular example,
I'm saying the user has

00:21:22.062 --> 00:21:24.570
listened to something,
and that something is

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.060
identified by a URL.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.540
And that's all it is.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.330
From there, you use the Google
Client, which already has the

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.290
access token which has been
granted by the user going

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.130
through the consent
flow to it.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.810
And you simply just post this to
the moments vault, which is

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.770
the URL for the moments API.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.710
From there, Google knows that
the activity has occurred, and

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.930
you're pretty much done.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.680
The result of this can
be used as well, for

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.750
logging and other purposes.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.370
But for the purposes of Popular
on Google+, that is

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.350
all you need to do.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.920
So at this point, if we go back
to the Popular on Google+

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.150
section, let's think about it.

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.060
What do we know how to do?

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.680
We know who's doing what on
your site, and to what.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.370
So we can display the account,
basically by

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.290
uniquifying the URLs.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.750
And we know that that
number of users has

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:14.900
performed that activity.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.120
The last piece of data that we
need is data about what that

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.920
URL actually corresponds to.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:26.680
And the way that we do that is
by requesting that sites add

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.430
schema.org markup
to their page.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.880
Now, schema.org is an open
standard that simply just

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.350
involves adding additional
attributes to existing HTML to

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.790
tell us more about what it is,
semantically speaking.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:42.420
Now, Google is really good at
inferring meaning from HTML.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:46.470
But at the same time, schema.org
allows you to

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.790
specifically indicate what
that content is.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.920
Is it a song?

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.220
What is its duration?

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.770
What language are we
talking about?

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.650
It basically takes the guesswork
out, and really

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.840
makes it much more
deterministic.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.860
And it's an incredibly
powerful technique.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.190
But I will start by talking
about a simple example here,

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.040
corresponding to a song.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.360
Now, take a look
at this markup.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.680
It's very simple.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.590
Obviously, it would be more
complex, in all likelihood, on

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.010
a real site, but it really
gets the point across.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:18.480
This represents a displayed
representation of a song.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.930
You can see there's an image.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.390
There's the BBC Radio 93.5 is
the name associated with it.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.250
There's genre information.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.367
But is all this kind of in
a mishmash of divs and

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:29.520
spans and all this.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.760
There's a listen control
at the bottom.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.620
It's actually kind of ironic
that most, or at least many

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.010
websites, are generated from
structured content, and

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.722
completely lose it
on the way out.

00:23:38.722 --> 00:23:44.420
Schema.org allows you to put
those semantics back in.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.110
So how do you do this?

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:48.720
The first thing you do is by
circumscribing the universe of

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.080
discourse that you're talking
about, simply just by adding

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.840
the itemscope property to
the top-level div that

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.200
encapsulates all the information
about this song.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.540
Itemscope basically just
says, this is a thing.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.510
The next attribute you add
is itemtype, which says

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.180
what type it is.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.150
The types are all enumerated at
schema.org/docs/full.html.

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.450
In this particular case,
we're talking

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.710
about a music recording.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.410
Now within the type of music
recording, a lot of additional

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.630
attributes can apply, that
map very directly to this

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.850
particular DOM.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.970
All of these are marked via
itemprop attributes.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.490
So you just add itemprop
to the DOM accordingly.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.520
You'll notice that we've marked
where there's an image,

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.330
what the name of the music
recording is in this

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.500
particular case, the
genre, and the

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.870
language which it occurs.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.400
There may be a bunch of
additional data on the page.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.800
Now, that's fairly
straightforward.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.010
When Google's crawlers get to
this content, it allows us to

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.080
pull all these fields out,
sanitize them appropriately,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.260
and render them directly and
meaningfully in the Popular on

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.470
Google+ box.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.580
It's an incredibly powerful
technique, and something that

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.325
extends well beyond the Popular
on Google+ box.

00:24:56.325 --> 00:24:59.670
So I suggest that you take a
look at schema.org if you have

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.010
any interest in it, because this
is the sort of thing that

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.260
will continue to pay dividends
over time.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.877
Today, Popular on Google+
supports two different types

00:25:08.877 --> 00:25:13.370
of schema.org markup,
corresponding to a number of

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.200
different types of activity
to which that could occur.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.550
This is in the music and
movies verticals.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.370
So for music, the schema.org
type is music

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.320
recording, as you see.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.740
You can listen, discover, or buy
that, or at least indicate

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.010
that your users are doing so.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.030
And for movies, discover, buy,
want, and review are the

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.480
applicable activities.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.330
But of course, the team is
working extremely hard to

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:39.450
expand the types of entities
that are understood, as well

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.570
as being able to represent of
those entities in a much more

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.740
fluid way, in a much more
meaningful way.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.590
Popular on Google+ is really
only the beginning of this

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.440
integration.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.740
ARDAN ARAC: Thanks, John.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.800
I'll say the closing words.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.140
So basically, we showed you
today how you can really jazz

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.230
up your brand queries.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.680
But as the search team and the
social team and with this

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.680
partnership, our goal is to go
way, way beyond brand queries.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.080
And the better we understand
your app, your site,

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.190
individuals' relationship to
you, either through the Follow

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:18.510
action or the user activities
that you're writing to us, the

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.010
better we understand the
content and how it is

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.320
consumed, the better we
can represent you.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:28.760
This gives us a new
understanding of how what

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.090
users are doing, how they're
consuming, which

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.240
user cares about you.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.920
All this stuff is just a wealth
of information that

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.550
will keep enriching the
search experience.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:42.560
And we started with brand
queries, and I hope this talk

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.910
and the examples and showed you
were exciting enough for

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.760
you to go and put that half an
hour of work in to activate

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:52.270
your Google+ page, or one week
of one engineer's work to

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.500
integrate Google Sign-In, but
there's a lot more to come.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.870
So thank you.

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:57.800
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Thank
you very much.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:03.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.890
JOHN HJELMSTAD: So we've
got plenty of time.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:08.175
If you would like, we are open
to the mic for questions.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:18.130
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious
how current search engine

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.560
placement and whatnot for
our old search engine

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.130
optimization, how that
comes into play here.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:26.820
Does it improve?

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.733
Does it even come into
play at all?

00:27:29.733 --> 00:27:32.620
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Ardan?

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.280
ARDAN ARAC: So basically, we
have, at least with all the

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.760
features we showed you today,
we haven't really changed

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.050
anything in the central column
in terms of ranking.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:41.550
It's all on the right
hand side.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.770
AUDIENCE: So regarding the
ranking on the search results,

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:52.140
the first result is what's going
to determine the card on

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.390
the right, correct?

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.830
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's right.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:58.060
AUDIENCE: Is it possible for a
single Google+ page, so let's

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:02.640
say TMZ for example, to trigger
on TMZ, a search for

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.910
that, and also for
celebrity news?

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.910
Does it matter, as long as
they're the number one ranking

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.900
for that term?

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.000
ARDAN ARAC: No, not
at the moment.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.150
So basically, because there are,
of course, other sites--

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.740
like Paris Hilton also is
in celebrity news--

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.840
at least at this point, we
don't choose which +Page

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.890
applies to a more
generic query.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.090
So the feature currently
is pretty tightly

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.310
tied to brand queries.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.940
AUDIENCE: So have to
specifically have a search for

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.130
your brand name for
that to appear.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.069
ARDAN ARAC: Yes.

00:28:33.069 --> 00:28:34.319
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.770
Can you hear me?

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:41.790
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yep.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:45.030
AUDIENCE: You talked about
+Page, but there's a lot of

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.270
talk on the web, like, for local
pages, business pages.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.270
Are we talking about
the same thing?

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.710
Because lately, you've being
mentioning all these different

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.150
definitions of pages.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:29:00.470
So is it +Page, local pages, or
are there different things?

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:01.550
JOHN HJELMSTAD: For the purposes
of this integration,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.470
we're just talking
about +Pages.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.080
There may be additional features
that we add similar

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.480
to this that are inspired by its
hope for success, but for

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.270
right now, we're just talking
about +Pages.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.060
AUDIENCE: Like for the
Google local pages

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.590
from Maps or something?

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.500
Or local businesses,
I mean, there--

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.770
ARDAN ARAC: Those are
also hosted on

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.830
Google+, as far as I know.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.750
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah, so that's
just a different type

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.070
of page associated with this.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.450
But for now, we're really just
talking about brand queries,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.260
so corresponds to product
or brand searches.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.440
ARDAN ARAC: But there is an

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.940
internationalization component.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.480
That brings me to
a good point.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.250
So for example, in the case of
Starbucks, there can be a

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.120
global Starbucks page,
like in English.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.390
So that is the content that
would show in most cases, at

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.660
least for queries in English.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.880
But then maybe Starbucks Japan
chose to also have an identity

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:51.130
and a page where they post
Japanese content.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.270
So we definitely look
at the localization.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.400
So for query Starbucks in Japan,
the content would come

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.310
from their Japan page.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.070
And for the query in English,
it would come from their

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.790
English page, or the page
associated with the US.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.560
And things can get even more
localized for local

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.540
businesses, to like state,
city levels.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:18.250
AUDIENCE: You have support for
authorship tying into Google+,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.010
so if somebody authors
a page, they show up.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.770
But you don't do that
for brands.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.130
You don't have any kind of a
form of publishership, so that

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.560
even though we have the ability
to tie our logos--

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.080
we can tie our pages back to
Google+, but you don't show,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.630
say, our organizational
information in little profiles

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.010
next to it the way you
do with authors.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.650
So can you talk about if
that's going to come?

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.290
And also, just today, you've--

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:43.220
I mean, an hour ago, you
announced that you're

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.500
supporting company logos.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.040
But you're not using
Google+ for that.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.870
You're using schema instead.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.620
ARDAN ARAC: No, the logos I
showed at the top, like the

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.570
TuneIn logo, that comes
from Google+.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.610
That doesn't come--

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
understand that.

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.220
I'm talking about, like, you
understand authorship.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.230
Somebody's written an article.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:01.930
They'd link to authorship,
right?

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.730
ARDAN ARAC: So we didn't really
touch upon authorship,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.430
but that is something I think
about a lot, and a lot of

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.050
people on my team also does.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:13.290
So basically, who is the
face behind content.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.650
And we talk about the
voice of TuneIn,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.550
the voice of Starbucks.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.700
But sometimes within that
umbrella is the voice of a

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.000
particular author, like
someone's name is

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.850
associated with that.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.600
So we didn't go into that, but
there are ways of actually

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.230
linking pages to individuals,
+Pages, and that's who gets

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.420
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.633
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I think that's
what he's mentioning.

00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:37.510
He's wondering what would happen
if a brand essentially

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.640
was the publisher, or at
least wanted that to--

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.150
AUDIENCE: Well, are there plans
to allow brands to have

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.050
that kind of linkage, as opposed
to just their authors?

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.330
So if "The New York Times"
wanted to show up, and you

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.130
list "The New York Times,"
the "New York Times"--

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.180
JOHN HJELMSTAD: If you said,
by "New York Times,"

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:50.350
essentially.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.120
AUDIENCE: --might like
to have their logo.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.320
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah, I mean I don't
know the details of that

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.210
feature all that much.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.410
But I guess--

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.940
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah, I mean
it's something that we've

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.440
considered.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.310
And I think the team is trying
to figure out all the

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.510
nuances with it.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.750
Because I think part--

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.130
and don't quote me too heavily
on this-- part of it is really

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:11.150
trying to provide the personal
touch, essentially, of who

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.510
specifically wrote it, as
opposed to providing a

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.260
different sort of clearinghouse
for kind of like

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.710
an umbrella of authorship.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:19.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.110
But there's a number of really
legitimate use cases for it

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:26.590
too, and so I could try to meet
you afterwards, and get

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.500
you in touch with the
PMs for that.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.110
I was wondering if you had a
roadmap for the other schema

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.160
that are already entities.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.540
So currently it's just
movies and music.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:41.010
Do you give a published roadmap
of the support for the

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:44.270
other ones, specifically for
the local business entity?

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:44.790
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.610
Actually, that's definitely
something we're interested in.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:51.850
I don't have a roadmap slide to
show, but it really depends

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.660
on two things.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.040
One is like, what idea, what
use case really strikes us?

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.760
And I'd actually love
to your ideas.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760
You know your service.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.420
You know your content.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.045
We have office hours
right after this.

00:33:04.045 --> 00:33:07.070
So if you come to that and say,
hey, here's how we think

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.610
you could use our data in
Google, like, that's how-- the

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.290
best ideas come from you,
so that's part one.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.900
But part two, what really
convinces us to focus on a

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.040
certain vertical or a certain
use case is also the data that

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.305
we're seeing coming through.

00:33:21.305 --> 00:33:25.145
Like, if I see a lot of data
coming from apps, sites that

00:33:25.145 --> 00:33:27.630
are about local businesses,
then we're like, OK, let's

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:30.420
look deeper into this, what we
can do with this, as opposed

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.715
to just talking the
hypothetical.

00:33:32.715 --> 00:33:36.160
So another way of sort of
getting your use case to the

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.140
front of the queue is actually
sending us data integrating

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.105
the Google+ Sign-In.

00:33:40.105 --> 00:33:41.355
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.050
ARDAN ARAC: Sorry, what?

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.120
AUDIENCE: Where can
we get the slides?

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.060
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I think that'll
end up being posted on

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.970
the I/O site after the talk.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.240
AUDIENCE: My name and personal
brand happen to clash with an

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.300
Italian design heiress
and an Austrian DJ.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.900
Neither one of those has yet
woken up to this and how to

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.570
use it and to use it.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:22.590
Now, I've the brand, domain,
got all that in place.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.510
I've claimed my +Page.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:29.409
So at this point in time, it
should be very easy for me to

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:30.510
get it all set up.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.110
Now meanwhile, sooner or
later, one or both--

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.850
probably both of those two--
are going to wake

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.540
up to what's happening.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.070
I'm just a little guy.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.750
They, on the other hand,
are actually

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.320
quite famous, big entities.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.949
What happens then, if
it's the same brand?

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:46.380
ARDAN ARAC: Right.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.239
So this is a hard problem, so
I'm just going to venture my

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:53.429
sort of thought-- like, this is
not a product definition.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.290
But, how I would fix that
is, the key is really

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.860
understanding the user's
relationship to

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:01.580
you or to that brand.

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:04.840
So if I know-- like, the basic
example-- if the user follows

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.120
you when they search for you,
the likelihood that they're

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.460
looking for you is high.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.160
Or another user has signed into
their page with their

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.900
Google+ whatever identity, also
the likelihood that they

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.090
are interested in
that is high.

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.430
So these are very explicit
signals, and they're not as

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.900
common as we would like.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.110
But that's kind of the answer,
understanding--

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.550
and maybe if my friend
is following you,

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:27.400
that's another signal.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.880
So I guess one way to solve
that is really understand

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.410
which user is interested
in which brand.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.920
JOHN HJELMSTAD: And just
expanding upon that a little

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.630
bit, of a lot of times we've
seen brand names that are

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.570
claimed in, like, Italy versus
the United States-- very

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:42.960
simple, right?

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.080
That's yet another axis along
which search can be a little

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.290
bit more intelligent, based on
geolocation, based on what

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.630
language you're searching
in, things of that sort.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:54.880
And then also, things that we
are rolling out having to do

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:59.950
with automatic hashtagging and
semantic analysis associated

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.250
with your content.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.220
If we know that somebody's
very interested in shoes,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.380
maybe we'll show Jimmy Choo.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:12.910
But if somebody's interested
in Jimmy Choo the website

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:17.220
maker or something, then
we would trigger that.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.530
But it's very early days
when it comes to the

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:21.920
search aspect of that.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.820
AUDIENCE: It's going to be
very much contextual and

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.420
relational then?

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:24.873
ARDAN ARAC: Yeah.

00:36:24.873 --> 00:36:25.326
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yeah.

00:36:25.326 --> 00:36:25.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.250
Thank you very much.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.540
AUDIENCE: Quick question on--
you guys talked about on the

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.720
right hand column,
pretty much.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.260
So I just wanted to know how
would that get incorporated

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.220
with mobile searches or tablet
searches, et cetera.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:46.110
Is that going to be included
in mobile as well, or--

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.500
ARDAN ARAC: The question's
about mobile?

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.710
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Mobile
and other displays.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.260
ARDAN ARAC: Good
question, yeah.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.770
So we started with desktop.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.150
Like right now, this
is available--

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:56.760
everything we showed is
available on desktop, but

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.220
we're working on
mobile as well.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.340
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Pretty much
anywhere else that search

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.920
results would show up, we seek
to integrate it in the most

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.790
contextual and non-intrusive
way.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.660
AUDIENCE: And the desktop one's
already public already?

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.160
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Yes, for
movies and music.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.620
Of course, we'll be rolling
out to more

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.410
categories over time.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.660
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:26.320
JOHN HJELMSTAD: It doesn't
appear that there's any

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:29.210
questions from the
extended sites.

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:31.115
So if there's any more here?

00:37:31.115 --> 00:37:34.120
One more.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.010
AUDIENCE: How would this
integrate with the cards?

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.990
Would it?

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.770
ARDAN ARAC: What cards?

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.190
AUDIENCE: Well, like Google
Glass cards or Google Now

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.190
cards, will you ever see
with a Google Now like

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:44.650
this being the top--

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.060
ARDAN ARAC: Oh, I see.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.500
Like Google Now cards?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.380
ARDAN ARAC: That
is a good idea.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.630
We haven't really thought
about that.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.880
JOHN HJELMSTAD: I mean, it's
another one of the visual form

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.490
factors that we're looking into,
to see what the user

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.140
experience will be like, whether
it be too cluttered,

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.710
whether or not it will provide
contextual and relevant

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.650
information.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.340
Anecdotally and intuitively
speaking, it

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.820
seems like it would.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.250
And I think that the
teams will continue

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:06.540
to integrate more.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.890
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:09.890
JOHN HJELMSTAD: That's all
the time we've got.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.110
ARDAN ARAC: Thank you.

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.360
JOHN HJELMSTAD: Thanks
for your time.
