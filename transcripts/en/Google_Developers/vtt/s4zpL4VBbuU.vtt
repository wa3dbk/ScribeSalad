00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.440
Hi, I'm Boris, an engineer
working in

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.850
Chrome developer relations.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.880
Today, I'd like to show you
how to use the remote

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.360
debugging feature in Chrome
for Android Beta.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.760
Before you get started, make
sure you've installed the

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.440
Android SDK, which includes
the Android

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.790
Debug Bridge utility.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.490
Once ADB is installed,
run the following

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.740
command in your terminal.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.220
Next, enable remote debugging in
Chrome for Android by going

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.870
to Settings, Developer Tools,
and enabling the option.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.550
Now, you'll be able to view all
open tabs in Chrome for

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.620
Android by accessing local
host on port 9222 in your

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.790
desktop browser.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.800
Clicking a link in your desktop
browser opens the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.790
Chrome developer tools
for that tab.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.260
Here, you can see the Chrome
developer tools inspecting

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.560
your mobile browser.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.200
As you'd expect, hovering over
an element in the inspector

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.500
highlights it in the browser.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370
You can manipulate the page
using the same Chrome

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.350
developer tools you're
used to.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.450
Here, I've hidden an element
by setting it's CSS display

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.134
property to none.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.170
You can also run scripts
in-line.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.815
Here, I've created an alert
in the inspected page.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.680
Remote debugging gives you
access to these, and many

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.700
other, powerful dev tools
features, such as live

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.440
editing, HTML, CSS, and
Javascript, breakpoints, and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.690
code beautification.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.095
