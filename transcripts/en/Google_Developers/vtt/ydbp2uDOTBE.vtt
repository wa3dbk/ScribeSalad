MARY GROVE: Great.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.630
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to our panel

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.290
discussion at Google I/O on
Lessons From Founders.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.890
My name is Mary Grove, and I'm
the director of Google for

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.730
Entrepreneurs.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.670
Google began as a startup in a
garage some 15 years ago, and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.650
that spirit of entrepreneurship
is very much

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.225
a part of our DNA.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:24.180
It is our team's mission to
empower the next generation of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.640
startups to be successful
around the world.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.140
We created Google for
Entrepreneurs specifically as

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.130
a central resource to launch
programs and partnerships to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.560
empower entrepreneurs
around the globe.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920
So as a team, we focus
on two things.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.650
The first is on building
community and fostering

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.540
entrepreneurship around
the world.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.320
So we work with about 30
different accelerators and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.480
incubators and co-working
spaces around the globe.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.060
And the second thing we focus
on is on equipping

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.980
entrepreneurs with products and
technology that they need

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.660
to be successful in launching
and growing their businesses.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.000
So we are very privileged and
lucky to work with and learn

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.410
from entrepreneurs in over 100
countries around the world.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.330
You can learn more about
our programs at

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.160
google.com/entrepreneurs.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.220
So today, we are very fortunate
to be joined by four

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.800
incredible startup founders and
serial entrepreneurs to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.970
share with us their insights
and lessons that they've

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.130
learned along their journeys.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.160
So let me please start by
introducing our panel.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.770
First, please welcome
Slava Rubin.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.290
Slava is the co-founder and CEO
of Indiegogo, the world's

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.180
largest global crowdfunding
platform.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.100
Indiegogo distributes millions
of dollars across its platform

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.300
every week.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.140
And they're really focused on
empowering individuals to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.550
raise funds for any idea,
be it creative, be it

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.230
cause-related, or be
it entrepreneurial.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.650
Slava recently attended the
White House signing of the

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.920
historic JOBS Act as a
representative of the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.570
crowdfunding community, and he
also founded Music against

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.010
Myeloma, an annual charity
event to raise funds for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.480
cancer awareness.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.670
And we've had an opportunity to
partner closely with Slava

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.070
and his team over the last
couple years, and we're really

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.280
glad to welcome him
here today.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.970
Next, it's my pleasure to
introduce Julia Hartz.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.210
And Julia is the co-founder
and CEO of Eventbrite,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.530
dedicated to democratizing
ticketing.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.240
And they have transacted and
enabled the purchase of over

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.520
100 million tickets on the
Eventbrite platform.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.270
Julia is focused on the
happiness and productivity and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.740
the growth of the team at
Eventbrite, and she has

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.620
fostered a culture there that
has landed Eventbrite on the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.200
list of the top five best places
to work in the Bay Area

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.540
for two consecutive years.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.250
Before founding Eventbrite with
her husband Kevin, Julia

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250
led TV development at MTV
Networks and FX Networks.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.310
So welcome, Julia.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.470
Next, please welcome Caterina
Fake, who is the founder and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800
CEO of Findery.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.840
Findery is an augmented-reality
app which

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.330
makes places come alive
and launched in

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.270
public beta last October.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.150
Prior to that, Caterina
co-founded Hunch, a search and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.850
discovery engine that was
acquired by eBay in 2011.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.010
And before that, she co-founded
the popular

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.570
photo-sharing site Flickr, which
Yahoo! acquired in 2005.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.340
Caterina sits on the board of
Creative Commons and she

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.090
chairs the board of
directors of Etsy.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.750
She was also named one of "Time
Magazine's" 100 most

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.590
influential people
in the world.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.230
And please welcome
Mary Lou Jepsen.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.020
Mary Lou is a serial
entrepreneur who has founded

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.380
or co-founded four different
startups, and she has served

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.940
as CEO or CTO, or both, for
all of them, including One

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.930
Laptop Per Child, Pixel Qi,
NY3D, and MicroDisplay Corp.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.600
Mary Lou has really disrupted
the display industry, and she

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.250
is currently the head of the
display division at Google X.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.550
Mary Lou has been a tenure-track
professor at MIT.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.830
She was CTO of Intel's
display division.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.680
She's been ranked in the top 50
female computer scientists

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.530
of all time by the Anita
Borg Institute.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.420
And she also made "Time
Magazine's" list of 100 most

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.340
influential people
in the world.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.700
So we are on the shoulders of
giants today, and looking

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.565
forward to a great discussion.

00:04:13.565 --> 00:04:15.520
What we'll do is I will
kick it off with some

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.079
questions for our panel.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.310
And in a while, we will turn
it over to the audience to

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.140
take some questions.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.079
So start thinking
about them now.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.650
We'll open up the floor to
questions in about 15 minutes.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.570
So thank you all for joining
us, and welcome.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.960
So we know today that the
web is democratizing

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.410
entrepreneurship
more than ever.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.280
And there are new models and new
medias possible, more than

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.180
ever before.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.140
So I'd like to start by asking
you each to spend a minute

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.920
helping us set the context.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.540
Set the context of why now?

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.360
And for each of you, please
share the key insight with us

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.960
that really led you to develop
and disrupt the industries

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.570
that you're in, starting
with Slava.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.470
SLAVA RUBIN: All right.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.190
First, let me just say
it's a real honor

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.020
to be on this panel.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.570
Just several years ago,
I went to I/O when it

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.520
was at Google campus.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.660
And just to be here is
incredible, and obviously,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.370
incredible panelists.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.950
Indiegogo was from 2006.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.130
There's two co-founders and
I, we got together.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.050
Eric, Danae, and I were
overlooking the Golden Gate

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.110
Bridge and we were sharing
experiences of how frustrated

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.100
we are to try to use the
internet to raise money.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.420
So if you could just go back
seven years to 2006, you have,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.030
YouTube is not owned
by Google yet.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.400
Twitter is nascent.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.430
You have MySpace is way
bigger than Facebook.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.210
And Obama is not a word
for most people.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.640
And it was really difficult to
raise money using MySpace,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.790
essentially, and Paypal.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.760
And my dad died of cancer when
I was 15, and then 10 years

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.750
later, I decided to do something
about it for a New

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.210
Year's resolution, so
I started a charity.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.680
And I wanted to use the
internet, because I thought I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.180
was a little tech-savvy.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.610
And it was very difficult.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.140
Eric was on the board of a
theater company and he was

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.490
trying to raise money.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.360
And Danae was working with
different filmmakers and

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.470
entrepreneurs.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.690
We thought, huh, YouTube is
doing something interesting in

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.660
the media space, and there's
other companies that are

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.450
disrupting other spaces, like
eBay, and Prosper was new.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.020
Why is it that the ultimate
democratization tool hasn't

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.740
really created access to
capital for anyone?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.270
It is still all a gated
experience.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.250
So we were actually completely
naive, and had not been

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.530
entrepreneurs before.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.800
And we launched in
January 2008.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.840
I would say that there's a lot
of myths out there as to how

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.200
you need to become an
entrepreneur, whether it is

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.620
you need to have a lot of
money to start off with.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.300
Whether it is that you need to
have a perfect marketing plan.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.850
You need to have a really
good business plan.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.500
You need to have done
a lot of research.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.770
I think the barriers to entry
are so low that you could so

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.790
quickly be able to identify
whether or not you could gain

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.680
traction and move fast in
whatever direction you can go,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.970
based on data.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.110
And that is something that 20
years ago, you used a business

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.720
plan to get that feedback.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.770
Hey, professor, what do you
think of my business plan?

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.900
Then give me feedback.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.210
Now you can actually very
quickly use your business plan

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.190
online, which is actually just
right away getting validation

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.280
from the market.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.290
A perfect example of that, and
I'll end here, is we just

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.150
actually had--

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.090
the company that got second
place at CES for most

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.420
innovative new product was
founded on Indiegogo, the

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.140
Misfit Shine.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.960
And they raised nearly
$1 million and

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.620
this was just an idea.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.460
And it was an idea that
VCs weren't sure if

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.840
they wanted to fund.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.730
And it's just so interesting
now, how it's becoming very

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.110
validated and it's going
out to the market.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.030
And we balanced that with things
like the first ever

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.800
crowd-funded baby.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.235
Yeah.

00:07:45.235 --> 00:07:46.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.350
SLAVA RUBIN: The couple was not
able to get insurance as

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.690
needed, and they were able to
get the in vitro fertilization

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.990
funded through the public.

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.160
Or you have Oscar award-winners
from just this

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.530
last February.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.560
So I think it's a great time
to really press forward and

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.320
have other thoughts.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.600
JULIA HARTZ: Wow, I wish I would
have thought about that,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.256
crowdfunded baby.

00:08:08.256 --> 00:08:10.543
Could you do that retroactively,
or no?

00:08:10.543 --> 00:08:11.250
SLAVA RUBIN: What's that?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.950
JULIA HARTZ: Can you do that
retroactively, or?

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.190
SLAVA RUBIN: You could try.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.270
JULIA HARTZ: So I'm the
co-founder and president of

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.980
Eventbrite, and I started
Eventbrite with my now

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.230
husband, who was my fiance,
and our third co-founder,

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.990
Renaud Visage.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.730
And I wanted to echo some of the
sentiments that Slava had

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.310
about what you need
to get started.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.710
And I think that what we did
in the beginning was we

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.809
started with the notion that
we really did want to

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.240
democratize an industry by
harnessing the power of

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.309
technology.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:41.580
And I think that what
we thought about

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.419
back then, in 2007--

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.180
which seems like so long ago--

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.850
was that everybody was thinking
about the future and

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:52.040
about the proliferation of our
online world, and how we'd be

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.670
living in a more
virtual world.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.040
And over the course of a few
years, that our entire world

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.680
would be completely online, and
that we would move farther

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.200
and farther away from personal
relationships.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.910
And our thesis was that
actually, you could use

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.010
technology and the social graph,
really, to bring people

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.170
together offline easier.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.160
And I think what we've seen
happen is just that.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.860
I think that going back to those
early days, the three of

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.590
us, we bootstrapped
the company.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.090
We didn't need many resources
to test this theory out.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.720
We needed a community that liked
to get together, which

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.720
just so happened to be the tech
community, of all places.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.070
And we needed to build
a great product.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.950
And so we are very heads-down on
what mattered to us, which

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.620
was truly just the product
and our customer.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.830
And it was like that
for four years.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.650
And I think that when I look
back at when we did actually

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.470
end up raising money, we knew
a lot about ourselves.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.540
And we also knew a lot about
what was happening in the tech

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.770
world, what was happening with
social, what was happening

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.640
with mobile, what was on
the horizon for data.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.230
And that helped us understand
how powerful this product that

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.670
we had built could be.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.910
And it helped us, obviously,
raise money quite quickly at

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.450
that point.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.390
And so from a very small germ
of an idea and, really, no

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.850
money, we are able to set
our own pace and test

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.490
this theory over time.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.890
And I think what comes to mind
today is when you think about

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.280
how you spend your time--

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.340
whether it be at a conference
like Google I/O, or at a

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.070
festival, or running
an obstacle race--

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.320
those offline experiences are
incredibly powerful, because

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.200
those are indelible memories.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.980
And while we're capturing
memories on our Google

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.870
Glasses, those are the types
of things at these offline

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.950
experiences that you're never
going to quite forget as

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:47.150
easily as a newsfeed article
that you read.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.210
And so I think we're really
understanding the power of the

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.170
live experience, which
hopefully, you guys are all

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.420
experiencing today.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.240
CATERINA FAKE: Is this on?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.970
Ah, now it is.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:06.870
I'm very jealous of the
four-year, is it, kind of

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.690
startup path.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.290
I've tried to do that, but I
always went broke before the

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.580
four years were out.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.890
I'm in many ways an accidental
entrepreneur.

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.830
I am someone who always loved
computers, but I was an

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.280
English major, and I studied
art, and I was interested in

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:28.770
other things.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.510
But one thing I think is common
to me and probably

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.630
everybody on this panel and any
entrepreneurs in the room

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.920
is that you are the kind
of person that sees the

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.360
possibility in things.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.390
And you can't help but, when
you're out in the world, see

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.820
things that need fixing, or
problems that need solving, or

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.330
ways that you could help.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:57.470
And also a sense that you
could build this thing.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.390
That you could make
this thing.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.720
That if you just kind of sit
down at your computer and

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.060
start coding, you can actually
build something that can

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.530
change the lives of people.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.580
And this is, I think, kind of
where the impulse comes from.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:15.700
And until I was in my mid-30s,
I didn't self-identify as an

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.590
entrepreneur.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.080
And yet if I looked at all of
the things that I had done, I

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.130
was always a starter.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.240
I was always kind of a person
who just developed things in

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.680
my spare time and just hacked
on stuff at night and on

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.780
weekends, when I
wasn't at work.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.510
And that is, I think,
where the strong

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.100
tendency has come from.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.640
In all of the companies that
I've built, including my

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.210
current one, my last one, the
first one, all of them--

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.280
the ones that nobody's even
heard about and the ones that

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:48.320
failed miserably or were lost
in the sands of time--

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.590
those kind of came from that
same general impulse.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.040
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Why now?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:59.360
I just started a new effort at
Google X, and I can't talk

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.990
much about it.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:06.010
By why now, there, is there's
in some sense, at Google X,

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.970
it's a bit like the hardware
division of Google.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.080
And there's no more silicon
in Silicon Valley.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.920
It's all iPhone apps
and whatever.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.590
Nexus apps, and so forth.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.130
But I love hardware.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.220
I loved flashing colored lights
as a kid, and I just

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:24.160
kept going with that.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.490
So I did a lot of art in
electrical engineering and

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:27.860
optics and things like that.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.770
So that, for me, came together
in displays.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:34.140
And I used to make really,
really expensive things,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.080
one-of-a-kind things.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.990
Designed a system to project
video on the moon for all of

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.450
humanity to see.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.130
And I decided, wow,
democratization, this stuff

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.440
was happening about 10 years
ago in cellular technology.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.210
And I thought, how do we get
data to all the people of the

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.050
world, not just the
rich people?

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.760
So I was lucky enough to meet
Nicholas Negroponte and start

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.170
One Laptop Per Child with him.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.130
And I became a--

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.340
I hadn't designed a laptop
before, but I designed the

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.600
$100 laptop.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.610
And I got in an access to fabs
that nobody got access to at

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.900
the level that I did.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.210
And I decided to start my next
company-- again, I just always

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.310
think, well, we're alive.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.290
How do we use the
time the best?

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.470
What can I do today?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:29.200
And what's the sort of imprint,
the impact, that I

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.170
can contribute to?

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.770
So I started a company in 2008
called Pixel Qi, given the

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.140
access I've gotten, in a pretty
broken part of the

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.240
hardware industry, which is
the display industry.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:46.520
Which runs on and off between
zero and negative 20% margin,

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.460
and has slashed pretty much all
R&amp;D for the last 10 years.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:53.830
So we're one of the few
organizations that's done some

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.560
innovative R&amp;D in the
display industry.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.020
And it's my belief that the
devices that we use, from the

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.820
smallest to the largest, are
pretty much, if you look from

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.910
a cost structure, a use
structure, and a power

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.620
structure , screens, given
the cloud has happened.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.400
And so now, because it's
completely broken, the funding

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.060
models are completely
screwed up.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.390
VCs used to have 30,
40 X routine.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:22.750
Now they struggle with
one X routine.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.190
Angel funding isn't sufficient
for hardware.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.920
And I thought, roll up my
sleeves, figure it out.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.850
So I moved to Asia and
learned Chinese

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.920
and was pretty effective.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.382
But now I'm back in the Bay
Area, working for Sergey.

00:15:37.382 --> 00:15:38.110
MARY GROVE: So great.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.200
Thank you.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.600
Just curious, a quick
show of hands.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.540
How many entrepreneurs
in the room today?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.610
About 50%.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.090
How many aspiring
entrepreneurs?

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.210
Great, great.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.400
Well, thanks for joining us.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.250
So I'm going to turn quickly--
we often speak about the

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.890
importance of team, and how
that's just the most

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.230
fundamental part of a startup.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.980
Julia, I'd love to ask you some
of your learnings and

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.880
experiences from building and
growing a team at Eventbrite

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.700
and fostering the culture
that has been clearly so

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.080
meaningful.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.160
JULIA HARTZ: Well, first and
foremost, I can't stress

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.380
enough-- especially since I
married to him-- on how

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.660
important it is to find
the right partner.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.420
I think that what we've
realized in building a

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.450
co-foundership while also being
married, we have to be

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.600
quite careful about where we
draw the lines and how we

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.850
divide and conquer.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.500
But in hindsight now, seven
years later, I look back and

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.470
understand that this is a lesson
that all co-founders

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.660
should learn.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.830
And that it starts with finding
the right partners.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.170
And maybe they're not your
co-founders, but they're the

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.350
second people in line to you.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.400
They're the people that rally
around your idea.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.690
But those people should have
your best interests at heart,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.460
or the best interest of what's
most important to you.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.560
And also, they should have
complementary skills.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.460
I think that the fact that Kevin
and I, our skills really

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.319
don't overlap, is such a
great advantage for us.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.920
Because we're able to have this
incredible air cover now,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.170
over a company that's 250 people
large, and that we

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.210
operate together on a
day-to-day basis.

00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.579
And when I think about how lucky
we are to make all that

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.460
work, I truly feel fortunate.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.369
But I also think that there's
some really specific lessons

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.010
in there for all co-founders.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.589
And then team.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.280
I mean, we have 21 minutes
and 15 seconds.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.720
I could go on and
on about team.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.230
But I think that when you get
to the point where you start

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.520
having people come on board,
you have to remember and be

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.910
humbled by the fact that they're
giving up their career

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.710
and livelihoods for your idea.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.110
That they're putting their--

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.650
not giving up, I guess,
but they're putting

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.510
their careers at risk.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.980
And I look around the
room every day and

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.570
I think about that.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.600
And it humbles me, because I
think there's something so

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.960
powerful about being able to
get somebody excited about

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.630
your vision.

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.420
And it still very much
feels like our vision

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.520
is just this idea.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.920
And it's sort of this
harebrained idea, and I can't

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.520
believe that so many people
would believe in that idea,

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.600
and come and sit alongside us
and fight the battles that

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.540
we're fighting with us.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.560
And so I think coming from that
humble perspective of

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.170
understanding how incredible
it is to be able to build a

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.680
team is, I think, a really
good starting point.

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.590
And then I think when you have
those teams, making sure that

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.300
each person on your team can
fully understand how their

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.780
work impacts your vision, and
that your vision is crystal

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.250
clear and it's compelling--

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.090
those are some of the most
important things you need to

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.210
do on a constant,
constant basis.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.850
I'm constantly reiterating our
vision and making sure that

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.670
every single person in the
room understands how they

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.750
directly impact that vision.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.080
And we're at 250.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.860
I don't know what's next, in
terms of how we scale.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.460
Some of you may be able
to tell me that.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.650
But I still know the first and
last name of every single

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.310
person on the team, and what
they do, and how that impacts

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.840
the vision.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.680
So there's that ability to stay
connected to your team

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.613
that I think means all
the world to them.

00:19:13.613 --> 00:19:14.044
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:19:14.044 --> 00:19:14.910
Great.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.740
Mary Lou, a product
question for you.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.170
I am just fascinated by the
way you have been able to

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.560
dramatically disrupt the
display industry--

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.050
slashing power consumption,
slashing the cost.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.310
Talk to us about the process
of bringing an idea into

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.810
product, specifically physical
product form.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.570
And what lessons have you
learned in the various

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.340
iterations of display that
enable you do the work that

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.590
you do today?

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.180
MARY LOU JEPSEN: It's
interesting, because these

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.330
days, the manufacturing is
controlled by a small number

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.530
of countries, primarily Taiwan
and South Korea.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:55.840
And so you need to figure out
how to deal with cultures,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.650
learn the languages,
and so forth.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.170
But in many ways, it's freed
me for the last decade,

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.100
because I don't really actually
have to worry about

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.200
manufacturing problems,
yield reliability.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.830
Because basically, all I have to
do is get a whole bunch of

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:13.410
people to say yes because
they have my back.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:16.590
And if I can get about 100
people in the various fabs to

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:21.190
say yes-- they say no 99% of
the time, but you work and

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.030
noodle through.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.840
And so the industry has changed
so much since when I

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.890
started, when we built our own
manufacturing facilities, till

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.115
now that the problem--

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.700
I've sat on a bunch of startup
panels over the past year, and

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.250
I've noticed a rise of the
multinational startup.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:44.410
And it's hard--

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.260
15 time zones and languages--

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.640
but there's these huge
advantages in doing that if

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.370
you can navigate the
cultural things.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.340
So the product stuff is sort of
more cultural, and how to

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.730
get people to come together in
various, if you will, axes of

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.630
creativity--

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.900
Asia's creative in that they
create a million units a day

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.990
of something.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.230
And maybe they're not sort of,
in some Silicon Valley terms,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.460
swinging for the fences in an
innovative architecture.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:15.940
But boy, can you combine those
two axes and the sensibility

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.260
around these things, process
windows, and yields, and

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.250
[INAUDIBLE], all of that
has to work on

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.600
any product you make.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.870
But a lot of the engineers there
have never been allowed

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:33.810
to get in the lab and break
things, and not do what I say,

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.500
like violate what I say.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.610
And sort of creating--

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.960
it comes back to team and
creating these cultures where

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.170
you can create these hybrids.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.090
And take these super-creative
people and get them good on

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.360
both axes, really.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.040
It's never a single
individual.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.100
It's creating the
team to do that.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.440
MARY GROVE: Caterina, you have
built three successful

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.520
consumer technologies, had
two phenomenal exits.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.090
Can you talk with us about the
process of exit and the

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.460
different factors and
consideration in your mind,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.930
and how you navigated that?

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.870
CATERINA FAKE: Well, exits--

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.034
exits are--

00:22:09.034 --> 00:22:11.010
exits--

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.460
there's always kind of a lot
of stories behind the exits

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.710
that are not visible
or understood.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:25.740
So to kind of go back
to Flickr, which

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.940
was acquired by Yahoo!

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:32.710
In 2005, Flickr came out of
a company that had failed.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.870
We had started a company
to build a game.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.460
And we had started it in 2002,
which if you recall, was a

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.820
terrible time to raise
capital for anything.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.780
Especially a consumer
internet play.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:51.390
And we were also trying to do
something that people didn't

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.690
really understand.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:55.010
We were building a browser-based
game.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.770
It was a massively multiplayer
role playing game.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.660
It was somewhat quirky.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.620
It was a bit odd.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.860
And it was not understood
what the hell it was.

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:08.880
People were like, can you buy
it on the shelf at CompUSA?

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.230
Like what is this thing?

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.020
And the only things that you
played in your browser at the

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:17.700
time were Solitaire
and casual games.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:23.200
And so it would be kind of
like an exaggeration--

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.260
I mean, it would be an
understatement to say really

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.770
that we had trouble
raising money.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.850
We were unable to
raise any money.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:33.360
We prevailed upon our friends
and family, who finally gave

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.180
us, we managed to scrape
together $150,000, $200,000 to

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.390
actually run our company.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.560
But nobody was getting paid.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.610
And it really kind of struck
me when Julia was talking

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.400
about the team, that here
are all these people.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.150
Not only were the Flickr team
members along for this crazy

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.800
ride, but most of us weren't
getting paid.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.480
So it was a bit nuts.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.340
And to get up every morning--
the only guy that was getting

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.600
paid was the guy who
had three kids.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.080
So if you want to survive
in this industry.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.670
It's actually been proven
to be the case.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.420
Like in the Donner Party, only
the single men were eaten.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.130
CATERINA FAKE: Get married
and have children

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.620
as fast as you can.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.800
So anyway, the only guy who was
getting paid was the guy

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.930
who had three children.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.310
Survival, people.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.650
This is what it's about.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.800
Like the startup businesses
is like, do or die.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.450
It's like a revolution.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:31.950
You're like, you win
or you're dead.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.530
And this was kind
of like that.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.140
So we were dying.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.490
We had about three months of
money left in the bank.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.330
We were eating ramen
and selling our

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.700
furniture to make payroll.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.220
And then we said, to
hell with this.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.450
This is going to fail.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.200
This game is doomed.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.720
And we gotta do something
else.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.810
We only have three months of
money left to pay our one guy.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.820
So Stewart has this idea.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.290
He's like, photo-sharing.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.530
He wakes up in the middle
of the night.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.140
He's like literally got
103-degree fever.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.720
I was married to him at the
time, so this is why we're

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.490
waking up together, with
my co-founder.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.200
And he's like, we should do
a photo-sharing site.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.160
And I'm like, you're--

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:18.870
whatever.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.350
Drink some water.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:21.290
Go back to bed.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.450
And so we talked about it a
little bit more, and we

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:27.050
figured, OK, well, there's a lot
of things that we learned

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.010
from the social aspects
of our game.

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:29.960
We can put this together.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.320
We can make a thing.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.680
We spent about eight weeks
developing this thing.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.770
We called it Flickr.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:40.520
It was a chat where you could
drag and drop photos into a

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.920
conversation.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:51.000
It was actually a POS, but it
was widely noticed, actually.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.050
Because if you recall back at
the time-- it was like 2003--

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.890
social networking was on the
rise, and people thought this

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.300
was cool and this
was like social

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.320
networking around photos.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.170
And so we kind of had hit
it, and we kind of

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:04.910
knew we'd hit it.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.410
Because suddenly we were getting
calls and people were

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.880
interested in us, and we were
six unknown people in

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.410
Vancouver, and nobody
would return-- so it

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.380
was kind of a thing.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:14.244
Anyway, we were talking
about exits.

00:26:14.244 --> 00:26:15.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.190
MARY GROVE: So many great
insights I just

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.180
took away from there.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.520
Have children.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.500
Great ideas come from a fever.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.080
CATERINA FAKE: So this was the
pivot, and then it was

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.860
successful.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.155
And then we got a call from
bunch of acquirers.

00:26:25.155 --> 00:26:26.375
And then we were acquired.

00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:27.130
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.800
CATERINA FAKE: Just
to wrap up.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.664
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.664 --> 00:26:34.858
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:34.858 --> 00:26:36.040
MARY GROVE: So amazing.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.070
CATERINA FAKE: Sorry.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.700
MARY GROVE: In just a couple
minutes, we'll start taking

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.740
questions from the audience.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.480
So I encourage you, if you
have a question in mind,

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.250
please go ahead and start
lining up at the two

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.440
microphones here.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.540
So next question is for Slava,
and it's more of a

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.150
policy-related question.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.630
I'm really intrigued by your
work with the JOBS Act and

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.260
representing the crowdfunding
community.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.420
So please talk with us about
the role that founders and

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.140
entrepreneurs can play in
advancing the conversation

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.360
forward around tech policy.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.820
SLAVA RUBIN: Yeah, so I'll take
a little bit of a windy

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.480
road there.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.575
It was interesting, when they
asked about, how many of you

00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:11.260
are entrepreneurs, how many
of you raised your hands.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.390
I don't know if you would change
your question if the

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.830
question was, how many of
you are entrepreneurial?

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.430
I actually think probably more
of you are entrepreneurs than

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.120
raised your hands.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.070
See, in our perspective of it,
yes entrepreneur might mean to

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.610
actually have started the
business or whatever.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.380
But we recruit mostly
entrepreneurs.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.220
It's actually quite challenging,
in terms of when

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.740
you want to be collaborative
and authentic and all that.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.680
But see, there's certain types
of people who say, oh, I

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.180
didn't get to do that
because there wasn't

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.810
enough this, right?

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.260
I didn't have enough
money, enough time.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:43.410
That person didn't let me.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.060
We couldn't partner
with that company.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.760
And there's certain types of
people that say, I got to

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.480
figure it out this way.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.870
And the people who don't take
no for an answer and don't

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.890
really care what the obstacle
is in front of them are

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.820
entrepreneurs.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.370
That's the spirit of the
entrepreneur, which is, "See

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.750
wall, run through it." But
actually fail five times, so

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.050
get your head hurt
really hard.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:05.760
Right?

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.070
That's entrepreneur.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.840
And in my opinion--

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.530
you're getting into a pet
project, which is

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.780
entrepreneurs can
save the world.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.890
Which is entrepreneurs
will figure out the

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.210
solution to any problem.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:22.380
And it's really just a language
that hasn't been

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.210
fostered enough.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.800
Which is, it's obvious that
we should learn math, OK?

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.360
It became obvious that
we should learn

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.030
languages beyond English.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.920
Cool.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.710
Now it's become obvious
that we should

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.570
all learn code, right?

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:39.510
So you have code.org.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.170
You have Chicago starting to
teach code into every high

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.260
school, all this good stuff.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.840
It's just a matter of time
before it becomes obvious that

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.550
teaching, in an experiential
way, entrepreneurship should

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.200
be part of your curriculum
from seventh grade, third

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.700
grade, or whatever grade.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.790
And I've written stuff
about this.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.390
Which is kind of sad, in my
opinion, that when you're a

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.450
little kid in kindergarten, and
you have those little toys

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:04.750
that you play with, you get to
play with fireman or woman.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.940
You get to play with nurse.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.970
You get to play with
lawyer, doctor.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:09.285
You don't get to play
with entrepreneur.

00:29:09.285 --> 00:29:10.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:11.830
SLAVA RUBIN: And it might be
because it's really hard to

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:12.590
say entrepreneur.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.550
So we could just call
it Google, whatever.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.060
SLAVA RUBIN: But really, that's
a statement as to how

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.800
we grow up.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.760
And it's funny, because when
we graduate high school or

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.360
college, we're all told to be
innovative and leaders and all

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:26.820
this stuff.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:29.200
But really, what we're prepared
to do is to become

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.780
bankers or developers or
consultants or whatever you

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.460
want to call it inside somebody
else's organization,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.090
which is inside of a system that
somebody else created.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:44.450
Why isn't it that we are being
taught to be able to take

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.260
risk, be creative, fail--

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.170
it's totally good to fail.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.060
We just have to learn that.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.340
Learn from it.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.920
So for me, the idea of whether
it's equity crowdfunding,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.190
which is where Indiegogo has
had a lot of participation

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.530
with the SEC and the White
House and all that stuff.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.400
But also in terms of
empowering more

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.940
entrepreneurs-- if you get off
on the sixth floor of our

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.270
office, which is at 965 Mission,
which is right on the

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.210
corner, the first word you'll
see is a huge sign of the word

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.290
"Empower."

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.830
I mean, that is Indiegogo.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.050
Which is to empower people
to do what they

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.320
didn't think is possible.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.800
See, if you empower an
entrepreneur to do something,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.010
you could change the trajectory
of the future.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.010
There could have an air there
yesterday, and an entrepreneur

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.040
will create reality.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.140
So it's just fascinating.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.786
So I think more of you should
have raised your hands.

00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:27.235
MARY GROVE: Great, great.

00:30:27.235 --> 00:30:32.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.140
MARY GROVE: We're going to do
some rapid-fire questions, so

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.310
we'll try to do one minute each
question, if possible.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.062
Please.

00:30:39.062 --> 00:30:42.770
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Kent Nixon,
and I guess this is a question

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.000
for all of you, but specifically
for Mary Lou.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.400
Because I'm a computer
engineer, and

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.920
my passion is hardware.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.190
And I agree with what you're
saying, a lot of the stuff out

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.420
there nowadays is software
as opposed to hardware.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.640
But when I look at a piece of
hardware, I can say, wow,

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.450
that's really great, but.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.870
And there's always that but.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.560
And I think I can make it
better, but I have a specific

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:06.080
set of skills, and it takes more
than just me to make a

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.230
great product.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.780
I mean, how do you go about
finding people that meet the

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:13.480
skill sets that you
don't have?

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.890
How do you go about even making
the contacts to learn

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.930
about that kind of stuff?

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.390
Like where would you even
start, basically?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.010
MARY LOU JEPSEN: Yeah,
interesting.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.120
Because there's not
a lot of hardware.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.100
You know, IEEE has a ton of
meetings every week, here in

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.060
the Bay Area, if you're
in the Bay Area.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.190
But actually, OLPC, One Laptop
Per Child, $100 laptop?

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.920
It was a really small
hardware team.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:40.785
It was just me for the first 18
months, and then we grew to

00:31:40.785 --> 00:31:44.510
the massive size of, I think,
four hardware engineers that

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.310
were actually at OLPC.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:51.310
And used kind of Asia, Inc. and
the people that I was able

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.700
to create a team around, we
were sort of dotted-line

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.890
architects for groups of
low-level engineers in Asia.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.455
It means living on a plane.

00:32:01.985 --> 00:32:04.300
If you love it enough, you're
willing to do that.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.050
It means learning the various
languages and so forth.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.740
But it depends the scale of
what you're trying to do.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.400
And if you're saying, yes,
I like that, but--

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.840
you could join that team
or take it apart.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.170
It's hard, because you can hack
different things, but it

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.250
tends to be a big thing
hanging-- you know, a

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.940
functional tethered prototype.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.500
And it's really hard
for a VC to get--

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.300
VCs, actually, they don't have
the core competence anymore in

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.650
Silicon Valley, pretty
much, to--

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.210
and I'm sure there's
exceptions.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.580
But by and large, to
fund or even to do

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.620
diligence on hardware.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:43.930
But there are places that do
fund hardware, and you can

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.890
find them, depending
upon your bent.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.450
You do have to be creative.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.940
There are angels, certainly, and
super angels to fund it.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.260
And there are the hackerspaces
if you need to borrow an

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.970
oscilloscope for whatever,
and SEM.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.670
But yeah, it's not easy.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.090
But then again, there's not
this sort of path--

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.870
there's not much competition.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.120
So there's an advantage.

00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:13.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so this is
[INAUDIBLE] from China.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.880
So actually, I have a question,
but not specific to

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.130
any of you guys.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.300
And so my question is, because
we can find a lot of common

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.640
factor for successful
founders.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.280
And so I want to know, what is
your rating for the below

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.490
three factors?

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.640
They are vision, idea,
and execution.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.390
So how can you rate these three
factors, and what's the

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.640
reason for that?

00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:41.230
MARY GROVE: Julia?

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.550
JULIA HARTZ: I'm trying to
understand the question.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.870
MARY GROVE: So vision--

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:48.380
JULIA HARTZ: Like how would
I rate mission?

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.350
AUDIENCE: Vision, idea,
and execution.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.150
JULIA HARTZ: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.170
I would rate--

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:59.410
if I had a stack rank them?

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:00.600
AUDIENCE: From like 0
to 10, or 1 to 10?

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.260
JULIA HARTZ: I'm shooting
in the dark, here.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.199
I'll try to understand
the question.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.480
I think that vision is really
important when you're trying

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.330
to lead a group of people.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:17.060
I think execution is how you get
from point A to point B,

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.610
as Caterina can attest
to, as can we.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:22.090
And how you eventually
get people to

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.980
believe in your idea.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.730
But you don't really
start doing

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:26.800
anything without the idea.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.510
So I think they're all
intrinsically linked, and so

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.360
I'm not sure if I
would rank them.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.106
But I think that as
an entrepreneur--

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.310
I don't necessarily think you
have be the person who can

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.350
sell the vision.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.980
I think you have to do what
Slava said, which is, be

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.630
willing to run through as
many walls as possible.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:50.719
I, too, agree with him, in terms
of that's what makes an

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:53.830
entrepreneur an entrepreneur, is
just that eternal optimism.

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:58.110
But I think that having that
idea and having that moment

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.810
that Stewart had, when he woke
up in the middle the night, is

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.610
exactly what goes into
this mixture.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.440
And then vision is something
that really matters when

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.896
you're trying to get people
to sign on to your idea.

00:35:09.896 --> 00:35:12.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
nowadays, also, we just feel

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.090
like ideas, we have a
lot of same ideas.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.805
But no one just go ahead
and execute them.

00:35:18.805 --> 00:35:22.670
So probably execution is one of
the most important when you

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.330
have the idea.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:25.650
JULIA HARTZ: Well, I mean,
that's how you make the idea

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:26.650
into a reality.

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:27.990
You have to execute.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:32.060
And honestly, like day to day,
we're put to the task of

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:38.370
executing, even seven years
into our vision, I guess.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.640
If you're not executing, then
you really aren't able to grow

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:47.960
a viable idea into a company and
get people to support you.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.180
So yeah, I think they're all
incredibly important.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:50.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.750
SLAVA RUBIN: I would say that
"idea is super important" is

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:57.250
one of the ten myths of
entrepreneurship.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.580
Meaning, it's not.

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.030
If it was so big of an idea, if
it mattered so much, then

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.520
the idea of a coffee shop would
not become Starbucks.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.760
Obviously, other people know
that idea as well.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.970
So it's really about
execution.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:10.630
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.940
Thank you.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.800
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.836
We have time for one
more question.

00:36:14.836 --> 00:36:17.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] touched on
this a little bit, but I'm

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.320
hoping someone else will
volunteer to chime in.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.750
And my question is, how did
you find your co-founder?

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.240
And how did you know they
were the right person?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:26.890
Or did you?

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:28.218
SLAVA RUBIN: Match.com, right?

00:36:28.218 --> 00:36:31.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.676 --> 00:36:32.664
MARY GROVE: A wedding.

00:36:32.664 --> 00:36:34.146
JULIA HARTZ: I met
him at a wedding.

00:36:34.146 --> 00:36:40.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.740
SLAVA RUBIN: So my co-founders
were--

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.540
there's two co-founders.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.640
One was the technical guy.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.350
So he and I worked at
the same consulting

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:49.070
firm for eight years.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.280
We're best friends.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.380
We used to live together.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.970
He was on the tech side.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:55.795
So he had to round out his skill
set, he thought, so to

00:36:55.795 --> 00:36:57.000
go get his MBA.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.140
So he went to Haas to get his
MBA while I kept on working.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.280
And like anybody who keeps on
working who has a friend

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.270
that's getting their MBA, you go
visit them for the weekend

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:05.810
to get drunk for the weekend.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.120
And anybody who goes to get
their MBA, they have to start

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.580
a business, so they have to
start coming up with ideas.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.370
So he met his co-founder,
which is Danae, his

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.210
friend at the time.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.500
Danae and I flew out for dinner,
and we were all just

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.350
talking about stuff.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.096
And the idea was born.

00:37:23.096 --> 00:37:25.760
MARY GROVE: So I'd like to ask
each of our panelists to share

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.810
with our entrepreneurial
audience just one piece of

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:31.180
parting advice.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.980
In no particular order.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.730
CATERINA FAKE: Well, I think the
main thing, as Slava was

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.990
saying earlier, is it's
very easy to do

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.850
startups these days.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:41.625
So just really start.

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:43.970
Start from where you are
with what you have.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.580
If you don't have a co-founder,
start without a

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.100
co-founder.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.630
I think a lot of time--

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:50.010
it's interesting.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.830
A get a lot of emails from
entrepreneurs, asking, I need

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:53.350
a co-founder.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.150
I can't find a co-founder.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.000
How do I found a co-founder.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.320
That is actually a huge issue.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.430
Go to more weddings,
is one possibility.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.900
I mean, actually, you
know, whatever.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.400
Luck favors the aggressive.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.340
So you should go meet as
many people as you can.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.570
It's easier if you're
an extrovert.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.910
If you're an introvert,
just go to

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.150
everything and talk to everybody.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.600
And find that co-founder
out there.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.060
But really, just start
making the thing

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:21.980
that you want to make.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.530
If you can only do it with
a piece of paper and

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.050
a pencil, do that.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.260
It'll come together.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:31.020
In fact, I'm an investor
in Kickstarter.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.030
It's a competitor of Slava's.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:37.990
And I actually saw it when it
was just a Photoshop file.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.270
It was actually just-- it was
an image in Photoshop.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.840
I was like, I see this.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.972
SLAVA RUBIN: Yeah,
I think that--

00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:48.850
you know how sometimes people
tell you, oh, that's hot.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:50.020
Don't touch it.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.250
Yet you still kind of
need to touch it?

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:56.250
And you figure out that it was
hot, hotter than you thought?

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:59.230
That your tolerance for heat
was not higher than their

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.020
tolerance for heat?

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.070
It's interesting that you know
what I'm talking about, right?

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.790
Because most of you have
probably done that.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.000
But see, here is the same thing
at a different level.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.770
There's a macrosocial contract
of what it means to be able to

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:13.860
break through something or
not as an entrepreneur.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.020
So we fall within these rules
of, your idea is not big

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.810
enough, because a VC told you.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.940
There's things like--

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.230
it's, I don't know
marketing enough.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.320
I don't know PR enough.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:26.660
Right?

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.790
There's all these different
macrosocial contract concepts,

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.260
which is the same thing as if
somebody told you it's hot.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.630
Yet you were all daring
enough to touch

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.200
the kettle, the whatever.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.290
You should just experience it
yourself, and then learn for

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:41.530
yourself your own truths.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.490
Because I dare you-- you
will that most of

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.520
those are just fiction.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.950
They're somebody else's truths
that they could not break

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.070
through that.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:49.260
Right?

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.680
So there's no reason that you
would not be able to.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:00.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.770
MARY LOU JEPSEN: My advice is,
assuming that you start big

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.440
and swing for the fences, and
just don't do-- don't do

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.030
something small, first off.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.840
But assuming you do, and you get
to that point where you're

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.240
taking on one of the largest
companies in the world, even

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:17.830
though you didn't mean to--

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.970
I've never started to mean to.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.780
Be prepared to give away most
of your stock so you

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:25.600
can win that game.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.120
Because otherwise,
you're crushed.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.550
And just plan that early
on, what you're going

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.570
to do if you happen--

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.710
at One Laptop Per Child, I think
there was a "60 Minutes"

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.330
expose on some of
the large forces

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.620
that we came up against.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.400
And a lot of the stories
I haven't yet

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.610
told about Pixel Qi.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.180
But when you do get in that
seat, you have to be able to

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:54.890
figure out a way where it's
more attractive for those

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.870
companies not to crush you.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.760
And that's very difficult.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.030
And if you can plan for success
at the start, maybe

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.970
you can sort of navigate
through.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:07.020
That's, I think, the most
difficult challenges I've

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.050
faced in my career.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.870
And the other thing is,
why do startups?

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.060
If you just join a big
company, I mean--

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.820
I'm really bad at politics.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.320
I think if you do your own
thing, you can actually,

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.820
you're all in a little
lifeboat.

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:19.950
There might be leaks in it.

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.820
But you get to be out on the
sea yourself and figure out

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.890
your own way and learn all
the different things.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.520
And then maybe you can start to
sort of leverage the sharp

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.120
elbows in larger companies.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.410
Some people are better at it,
but if you're not one for the

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.730
politics of large companies,
startups are great.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.050
Because everybody's in the same
boat, willing to help

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:38.460
each other.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:39.945
They're really fantastic
environments.

00:41:39.945 --> 00:41:42.230
So go for it.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:44.400
JULIA HARTZ: The biggest lesson
that I've learned along

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.580
this journey-- and it was a
pretty big one for me, coming

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.030
from traditional media-- is
don't believe the hype.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.520
And I think I touch on that
almost weekly when I think

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.330
about what's important to us.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.940
And hype is a fairly vague term
as I'm using it, which is

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.230
either bad hype, the way Slava
was just presenting, that you

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.840
can't do something.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.680
You don't have enough
experience, or there isn't

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.720
money in X, or this idea's
too played out.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:11.600
And it's also on the flip side,
that god, things are

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:11.970
going great.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.380
I'm great.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.280
I must be great.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.000
This is great.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.180
There's one thing about having
confidence in yourself.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.670
There's the other thing in
always looking at the next

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.200
thing you need to be doing to
making your product better,

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.980
making your team batter, to
making your brand better.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.136
And it's not about--

00:42:29.136 --> 00:42:32.840
if all you care about is the
hype and all you're seeking is

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.710
the hype, there's very
little context.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.330
Or there's nothing really
underneath that.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.440
And that's where I tend
to see things go awry.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.380
So try not to believe
the hype, whether

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.380
it be good or bad.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.280
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.510
Well, three words that we've
heard consistently throughout

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.360
our discussion are
democratization, passion, and

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.470
change the world.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.030
And we truly believe that
entrepreneurs have

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.120
transformative ability to change
their communities,

00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.100
their companies, the world.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.860
And that when entrepreneurs
succeed, all boats rise.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.230
So, really appreciate all
four of your time.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.960
Wish you the best of luck, and
wish all of you in the

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.460
audience the best
of luck, too.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.360
Thank you.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:14.365
