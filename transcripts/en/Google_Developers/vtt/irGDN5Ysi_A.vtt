ERIC BIDELMAN: So
hey, everybody.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.100
Welcome.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.150
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.380
We're going to talk a little
bit about Polymer, a new

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.410
framework that Google is
building based off of Web

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.820
Components.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.070
We're really excited about Web
Components on the Chrome team.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.830
We're here in London.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.840
We sort of took a special trip
and wanted to introduce you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.900
guys to a few members
of the team.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.810
My name is Eric.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.660
I work on our Chrome developer
relations team.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.915
And my focus right now as is
Polymer and Web Components.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:32.835
Do you guys want to introduce
yourself?

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.560
MATT MCNULTY: Sure
I'm Matt McNulty.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.682
I lead the engineering team
that works on Polymer.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:37.650
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And I'm
Alex Komoroske.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.700
I work on Chrome's Open Web
Platform team, but I'm also

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.410
really interested in
Polymer stuff.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.630
And so Polymer is something we
originally talked about at

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.720
I/O. And so we're here today
to answer some of your

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.940
questions and obviously start to
have more of these sessions

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240
that we can talk to you guys and
cover the different topics

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.760
in Web Components.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's definitely
the beginning.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.720
ERIC BIDELMAN: Definitely
the beginning.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.550
There's a lot of stuff coming
out in web platform.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.540
I would say more so than it
ever has in the past.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.190
It's really exciting.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.030
But today let's talk a little
bit about Polymer, give you a

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.881
brief, brief introduction,
and then answer

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.600
some of your questions.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.010
So what the heck is Polymer?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.880
One of you guys want to start?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.570
What's the goal of Polymer?

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.862
What is it?

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:15.220
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Polymer
is a new type of

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.540
library for the web.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.080
And the idea is to help use
some of the new, emerging

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.750
standards and provide feedback
to them to make sure that they

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.740
are useful standards.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.750
That they're going to
be really powerful.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.720
And also help build a community,
an ecosystem around

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.800
Web Components, really.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.260
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's right.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.750
And we're doing that through
a set of polyfills.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.830
A polyfill library is
essentially polyfilling the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.990
native API before it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.320
available in a lot of browsers.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.470
And so this is great because you
can use this awesomeness

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.610
of Web Components today
in modern browsers.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.740
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So one thing
people don't realize,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.530
actually, is speccing out new
web platform features is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.660
really hard to do correctly.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.800
So if you just do it in a closed
room with very smart

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.040
people discussing it, if you
don't use it, it's very hard

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.770
to see how it's going to
feel in real life.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.720
And so this polyfill approach
actually allows you to use it

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.770
and go, oh, feels weird,
and provide

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.630
feedback back to the specs.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.700
In fact, we're seeing
a lot with Polymer.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.560
A bunch of people are using
Polymer, providing feedback,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.610
people on the team.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.759
And then we're bringing that
back to the standards bodies.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.390
And using that as examples
of this one felt weird.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.580
ERIC BIDELMAN: Absolutely.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.630
MATT MCNULTY: That's actually
one of the great things about

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.320
this team and the entire project
is that we're on the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.850
Chrome team, but we interact
with the standards bodies.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.950
And we come from a web
development background.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.910
Being at that intersection
is really exciting.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.380
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And with Blink
engineers as well.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.900
So we're talking all time with
the guys who were implementing

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650
this within Blink.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.550
ERIC BIDELMAN: And I'm super
happy to see a lot of awesome

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.650
developers are coming on
our developer forum.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.330
So we have a Google group, at
polymer-dev googlegroups.com.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.480
And framework authors, right?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.780
People that actually build
frameworks in their own widget

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.600
libraries, or whatever.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.420
And they're coming with their
expertise helping us flesh out

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.925
some of the stuff as we're
developing Polymer.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:52.730
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah, it's
really exciting to see this,

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.920
because you can tell it's the
beginning of what's going to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.970
be really thriving ecosystem,
a bunch of different

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.080
frameworks and developers
and standards.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.660
It's really cool.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.400
ERIC BIDELMAN: So it's
a set of polyfills.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.470
That's the foundation.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.270
Maybe it's more showing.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.060
We have an architecture
diagram of--

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.280
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I want to
clarify that, though, because

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.010
it's not just polyfills.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.450
I think that's something that
a lot of people think.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.500
They see Polymer, polyfills,
it's the same.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.330
It's actually quite a
bit more than that.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.150
And so here on this diagram that
we have on project site,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.560
the red is the polyfills.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.470
The idea is that it allows you
to pretend it creates a stable

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.260
foundation that allows you to
pretend like you're living in

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.870
the future.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.630
So you can just use
these technologies

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.520
as though they existed.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.910
Now, of course, because they're
Polyfills, over time,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.590
as browsers implement those,
you don't need the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.790
polyfills as much.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.810
And so, ultimately, in
theory, that layer

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.680
will entirely go away.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.530
ERIC BIDELMAN: There's a lot of
nuance to this chart here.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.902
And that's why this red areas
is sort of staggered, is

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:44.180
because at different points in
time over the next couple of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.770
years the browsers will
have implemented

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.700
these different API.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.140
And so, again, these go away.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.660
Which is great.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.560
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So a great
example is mutation observers

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.310
is actually something that we
have as a polyfill support in

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.620
there for browsers that
don't have it.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.050
But most browsers do.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.050
And so that's a great example.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.450
That's why it's a little bit
shorter in this diagram.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.840
Because it's already well
on its long way to being

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.710
[INAUDIBLE] deployed.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.940
ERIC BIDELMAN: And so as a
developer, like Alex said, you

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.540
can use these different pieces,
sort of a la carte.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.640
You can use just the platform
polyfills if you want.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.110
That's part of Polymer.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.880
But then we add, we go
one layer up, right?

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.360
And that's polymer.js.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.089
That's what we call the core,
Colonel, what have you.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.350
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's where
opinion starts coming in.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.870
The red part is really
just the specs.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.870
It's just the things that
are being standardized.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.180
The yellow is where opinion
starts coming about how you

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.110
should be using these
together.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.330
So conveniences, things that
allow you to reduce

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.110
boilerplate and to really just
be as productive as possible

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.970
on top of this.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.270
But it's a very light opinion.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.700
It's somewhat behind
the scenes.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.560
ERIC BIDELMAN: I think the way
I really see it is Web

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.410
Components in general, all these
specs that they see the

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.090
red layer here are coming
together, but it's really the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.790
Polymer core that we've
identified as necessary in

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.460
order to build a full-fledged
application.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.420
We need to sort of work these
custom APIs together and use

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.960
them in a way, things like
MDV, and data binding and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.780
event listeners and what not.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.650
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Specifications
are generally designed to not

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.280
have much of an opinion.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.170
And so this is where sometimes
you do need a little bit of

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.890
opinion to wire it together in
the way that works best for

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.525
end web developers.

00:05:05.525 --> 00:05:06.680
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's right.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.830
And then what's the
green, Alex?

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.940
You want to explain the
green a little bit?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.694
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the
green, we've actually

00:05:09.694 --> 00:05:10.860
got two boxes there.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.750
Again, this is a very rich
diagram with a lot

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.500
of stuff going on.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.020
The first one there is
Polymer elements.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.010
And that's just basically,
they're Web Components that

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.120
are built on top of
this the stack.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.960
And they don't necessarily
actually print

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.600
anything to the screen.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.280
So these are using one of core
tenants, actually, of Polymer,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.790
one of our parts of opinion, is
this notion of everything

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:30.750
is an element.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.030
And this is the one that we
say it again and again.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.790
And it's a mantra.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.340
At the beginning people
are like, oh I get it.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.100
You probably don't get it.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.790
Think about it harder.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.856
Because it really changed
the way you think.

00:05:39.856 --> 00:05:40.230
ERIC BIDELMAN: I didn't
get it at first.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.490
It takes awhile to wrap your
head around this new way to

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.215
develop applications.

00:05:43.215 --> 00:05:45.560
ALEX KOMOROSKE: When you see,
one of the custom elements

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.640
that we've got there now
is in the Polymer Ajax.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.890
ERIC BIDELMAN: I'll bring
up the [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.000
MATT MCNULTY: Polymer is, at
its core, I don't think we

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.460
really, completely
introduced it.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.000
We were just talking about
all the nuances of it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.480
ERIC BIDELMAN: There's a lot
of stuff to introduce.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.260
MATT MCNULTY: A lot of what it
does is it uses all these new

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.590
standards to create
custom elements.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.120
And really it's a custom element
building framework.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.860
And you can make custom elements
that are really,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.010
really, really complicated up
into including an entire app,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.870
or just very simple ones.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.910
And one of the great things
about custom elements in these

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.750
new standards is you can
sprinkle these things

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.370
throughout an existing page or
you can create something new

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.325
that is just Polymer.

00:06:21.325 --> 00:06:22.100
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.190
And one thing too, is the way
I think of it is these new

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.380
technologies of Web Components
are so powerful that people

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.780
don't know yet how to
use these right.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.950
And so we're trying to help,
along with the rest of the

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.150
ecosystem, discover this.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.720
Be pioneers and try
things out.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.960
See what works, what doesn't.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.060
What things should
be in Element.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.010
What things shouldn't.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.360
Our opinion, so far,
is that everything

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.640
should be in Element.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.550
So that's what we got
there at the bottom,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.950
that lower green box.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.040
It's things that are elements
that you can use to do useful

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.110
functions, useful [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.830
ERIC BIDELMAN: And just pointing
out, we already have

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.770
a base set of what Alex
is describing.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.590
It's things like doing
Ajax, right?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.490
Making an element that actually
just performs Ajax

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.950
under the hood.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.900
And then you can do really
interesting things with data

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.160
binding to that element.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.440
And it's a totally different
way to think about it, and

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.720
we're going to say this again
and again and again, but it's

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.540
very, very powerful when you
combine this stuff together,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.340
declaratively.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.275
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Everyone has the
moment where they go, oh.

00:07:10.275 --> 00:07:11.500
And that's when they get it.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.400
When their eyes go like that.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.910
MATT MCNULTY: Then they'll
understand why we say

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.332
everything is in Element.

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:16.520
ERIC BIDELMAN: I mean,
you can imagine.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.420
If all this stuff here that
you're seeing in this page was

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.060
built into HTML natively,
right?

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.830
Look at this functionality
you could possibly have.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.400
Now we're giving developers
that opportunity to build

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.320
whatever they want.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.330
Whatever functionality they
need, whether it's wrapping a

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.350
library, right?

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.680
I've seen people do things like
wrap the Google Maps API.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.260
Make tags out of G Maps.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.020
Which is really cool.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.970
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's a
really useful way to

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.930
repackage that stuff.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:37.820
ERIC BIDELMAN: Just
things like that.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.380
We're really excited about
the possibilities of

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.800
where this takes you.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.240
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the last one
last is the one actually

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.340
I'm most excited about.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.690
And that's polymer UI elements,
which I said in an

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.455
email, I think, last week.

00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:48.565
The name is a mouthful.

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.410
I'm sure we'll change
it at some point.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.120
But the idea of this is
actually, this is the one

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.430
that's really starting
to come together.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.800
It's really early stages.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.767
We talked a little bit about
I/O and Linus Upson talked

00:07:57.767 --> 00:08:00.040
about it in the keynote,
as well.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.070
We want to build a comprehensive
set of

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.760
opinionated UI elements.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.730
So these are just web components
that can be used

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.200
with other web components
and their arrival.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.070
In fact, you see here
other green boxes.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.240
Those represent other
frameworks, other sorts of

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
components.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.200
But we want to help people so
that when you start off you

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.210
don't have to go start from
scratch to put a web app.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.140
You just say, I want this kind
of thing, this kind of thing.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.650
Here's my app.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.810
We can automatically do
that app try style on

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.370
the left for you.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.530
That kind of thing.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.220
So this is the area I'm most
excited about because we've

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.130
got a bunch of people who are
excited to help take this

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.770
Google design skill that's been
growing for all kinds of

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.750
new apps, like the Maps apps
on the Android and iOS, and

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.280
really bring that to a
library and let other

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.159
developers use it too.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.270
ERIC BIDELMAN: And bring that
sort of thing to the web.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.610
Where it's really easy to
drop that in your app.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.240
You don't have to, like
Alex said, reinvent

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.340
the wheel every time.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.290
And you can pick and choose
different elements from

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.270
different UI vendors.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.030
And if they're all using this
web components, these

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.200
standards-based APIs under the
hood, it's very easy, as a

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.920
developer, to then interopt
with those between the

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.610
different elements.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.940
So I think that's the exhaustive
explanation of this

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.920
diagram here.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.810
But really, again, our
philosophy is to really

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.700
embrace HTML.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.420
Love it.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.140
Declarative first.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.280
Everything's a custom element.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.910
And if you're checking out
Polymer for the first time or

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.650
if you've seen it before, it
takes a while to wrap your

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.290
head around that.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.980
But it really is making custom
elements in HTML.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.310
Telling HTML about new things
and building those.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.910
I think we sort of
alluded to it.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.780
But another thing that we're
very interested in is evolving

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.490
with the web platform.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.010
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Right.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.180
ERIC BIDELMAN: So I think
I saw a question.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.550
And feel free to ask any
questions on our Google

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.030
Moderator page that we
have set up for you.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.270
But it's really about evolving
with the web platforms.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.250
So staying on the cutting edge
as these standards evolve.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.100
Staying up to date.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.020
And so we actually made an
explicit goal to try to only

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.070
support the [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.555
of each browser.

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:52.960
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's
very deliberate.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.890
Was it you that said,
someone said.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.850
A wise man once said, maybe
Eric, said if all you're doing

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.905
is watching in the rear view
mirror, you're going to run

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:01.645
into something.

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:03.140
You're going to crash.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.755
And so we're trying to make
sure that this future that

00:10:05.755 --> 00:10:08.670
we're all going to get to,
soon, in the near future.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.480
That when we get there we don't
go, oh, it's pretty much

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:11.980
like the past.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.400
We want to get, we think this
is actually a much bigger, a

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.330
revolution where
we're going to.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.560
I really want to emphasize, too,
the Polymer team, we work

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.400
with Blink guys.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.560
We're active on all the
standards lists.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.740
Our goal as a team is if the
standard that's developing,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.490
that's evolving, we don't think
it's the right thing

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.620
based on our experience and
the feedback we're getting

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.270
from polymer-dev and other
people who are using this,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.720
then we should help make those
arguments in the standards

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.320
bodies to change that.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.910
This is a feedback thing.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.820
It's not like, oh, we do what
the standards body says, no,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.460
we're actually involved
in this.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.230
MATT MCNULTY: That's something
we've done a lot in the last

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.680
year or so.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.410
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Absolutely.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.290
And a lot of it comes, too,
from feedback we get in

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.100
polymer-dev.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.050
Some people saying, well,
this feels weird to me.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.690
It's like, well, the reason
that's in the standard is for

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.220
this reason.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.200
They go, I really don't think
that makes a lot of sense.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.910
And we can take that feedback
back and point to that and

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.800
say, hey, developers don't
understand this.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.520
ERIC BIDELMAN: It turns out
there's a lot of really smart

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.270
developers out there.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.590
They all don't work at Google.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.700
They all work at these
big companies.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.300
And we absolutely value
their expertise when

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.980
building and stuff.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.360
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I've been
thrilled with the amount of

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.560
stuff we've gotten
in polymer-dev.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.410
Really great questions
and feedback.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.460
And smart people coming up with
new ways of using this

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.995
stuff and asking really
hard questions.

00:11:18.995 --> 00:11:20.761
It's really good.

00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:22.320
ERIC BIDELMAN: And to this
next point here, but

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.390
boilerplate code.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.383
This is something that no
developer likes is to write a

00:11:25.383 --> 00:11:26.880
lot of boilerplate over
and over again.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.940
And it turns out just with these
platform APIs there is a

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.070
lot of code that you have to
write over and over again.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.030
And that's something Polymer
is sort of addressing and

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.810
that's part of our opinion
is to minimize that.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.380
Some of the tedious app things
that you're going to have to

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.640
do when creating a
custom element.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.860
And then we've alluded to it, as
well, salt to taste is the

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.390
terminology we used
on the team a lot.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.400
And that's really that you
could pick and choose the

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.030
different layers
of that stack.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.300
ALEX KOMOROSKE: This is
really important.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.260
And I said this in the email
again last week.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.770
But the primary goal of this
project, we're really excited

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.790
about Web Components.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.950
We've been excited about
them for years.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:03.115
I remember, two, three, years
ago I talked with Alex Russell

00:12:03.115 --> 00:12:06.510
at I/O about Web Components
and how excited we were.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.970
The goal, for us, is to help
kick off and bootstrap what we

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.940
ultimately hope to be a thriving
ecosystem built

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.110
around Web Components.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.770
And that's not specifically
about Polymer.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.830
Polymer is something that's
trying to lead the way here.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.960
But we want this to be a
thriving [INAUDIBLE] with

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.880
other people too.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.990
And that's what we have a clear
layering of the stack.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.080
And we've talked to other
people who are using

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.900
individual polyfills or a bunch
of them to do their own

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.340
frameworks.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.220
And that is awesome.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.880
That is great.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.360
That's exactly why we're
doing it this way.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.610
ERIC BIDELMAN: So with that, do
you want to switch to demos

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.640
and actually show a little bit
what we're talking about here?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:40.130
MATT MCNULTY: Sure.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.920
ERIC BIDELMAN: Inspire
us, sir.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.350
MATT MCNULTY: All right.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.710
So we have a screen here
is just a text editor.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.620
And it contains a blank polymer
elements definition.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.160
So this is the declarative
API.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.360
There's an imperative
API as well.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.270
So this one we're just creating
an element called

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.690
my-element.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.440
And we can put tags inside of
other tags so we can start out

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.460
just putting in g-ratings,
which is

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.640
another one we created.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.200
So if we do that, I
can preview this.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.375
And you'll see that our little
rating stars pops up.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.560
And you can play with it.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.370
Cool.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:15.910
It's a Web Component.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.820
ERIC BIDELMAN: So just to
clarify, you're creating a new

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.390
element and you're using
somebody else's element that

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.220
they've already created.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.030
Another custom element within
a custom element themself.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.790
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.170
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's cool.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.390
MATT MCNULTY: So if you inspect
this in the web

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:29.870
inspector, you'll see that it's
hidden inside this grayed

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.550
out document fragment in
the developer tools.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.530
What that means is it's
in the Shadow DOM.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.860
So unless you have this little
check box showing Shadow DOM,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.222
you won't see it.

00:13:40.222 --> 00:13:41.750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's one
of the key notions of

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:42.640
encapsulation.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.876
That's core to Shadow DOM.

00:13:44.876 --> 00:13:46.710
MATT MCNULTY: So if you come
back here, one of the other

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.840
things we decided to do, it's
a little boring to just do

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.690
this with text.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.490
So we built a little
GUI builder.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.910
And this is just for demos.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.710
You can't actually
save anything.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.150
It's really just meant as
a playground to drag out

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.750
elements and see what's
exposed and make other

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.730
elements out of them, and
that kind of thing.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.580
ALEX KOMOROSKE: It's a great
place to play around with

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.850
these things, get
a sense of them.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.440
But one thing to note, and
you'll see it throughout this,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.670
is that inspector, the panel on
the right, is just one to

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.070
one correspondence
with the markup.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.300
It just saves you a little
bit typing, basically.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.430
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah so the tool
has a canvas in the middle.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.065
You can see this little
graph paper.

00:14:20.065 --> 00:14:22.280
It's got a palette down the
left-hand side and has this

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.210
property inspector down
the right-hand side.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.900
And the property inspector, as
Alex said, is just exposing

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.140
the properties of the
polymer element that

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.940
you're dealing with.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.170
So you can see we have a whole
lot of things down here down

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.890
the left-hand side.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.650
I'm going to play with
a couple of them.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.430
I can bring out a menu.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.290
I can bring out a toolbar.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.020
And you can see, you can
place these things and

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.180
play around with them.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.640
And it's actually, this isn't
doing anything special.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.750
All it's doing is creating these
custom elements for you.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.700
It's not generating any code
or doing anything special

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.530
behind the scenes.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.800
This is the actual code that
runs when you preview this.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.780
I can bring out tabs.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:58.890
You see these things
are interactive.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.060
You can play with them.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.990
So one of the cool things we
mentioned, one of the little

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.590
red boxes in that diagram
was called MDV.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.370
And that's short for
Model Driven Views.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.890
And what that does is
really interesting.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.160
It brings data binding
to the platform.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.790
So in this case, in our little
polymer constructor here, I

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.390
can say, just make
up a variable.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.060
So let's try and tie the
menu to the tabs.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.840
So I created a variable
and I gave it a

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.440
default value of zero.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:42.440
So now if I come up here into
the actual text, there we go.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.910
That should be easier
for everyone to see.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.870
If I come up here to
the actual toolbar,

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.270
sorry, not the toolbar.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.850
The menu, the tab.s this says
selected equals one.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.460
Instead I can replace
that with this

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.430
double mustache syntax.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.010
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Which is
familiar from lots of other

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.650
data binding earmarks as well.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:02.320
MATT MCNULTY: And use the same
variable that I used down

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.335
there before.

00:16:03.335 --> 00:16:07.760
And I come back into the
viewable side we can actually

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.590
do that in the tool itself.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.200
So if I come into the
tabs, you could see

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.790
it's selected as well.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:20.630
And if I come to the menu and
I bind it to the same thing,

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.470
now they're actually
bound together.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.425
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So you bound one
of those just directly in

00:16:24.425 --> 00:16:25.640
code and one of them
using a tool.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.390
Which, of course, was just doing
exactly the same thing.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.650
ERIC BIDELMAN: Essentially
you added a

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.780
property to your element.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.160
You define an element
in Mark Up.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.035
You created whatever properties
and APIs on that,

00:16:36.035 --> 00:16:37.510
as public methods
and properties.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.710
And then you've data bound two
elements together using MDB.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.660
Pretty powerful stuff.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:42.750
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Not even
a line a code, really.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.775
I mean just--

00:16:43.775 --> 00:16:44.350
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:45.580
We can take this entire thing.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.480
And we can publish it
onto the palette.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.620
And this is just temporary.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.220
If you refresh it goes away.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.900
And then the whole thing comes
out and you can see that

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.380
selected property that I added
just shows up here in the

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:54.980
property inspector.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.555
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So it's
being exposed out now.

00:16:56.555 --> 00:16:58.850
MATT MCNULTY: And if you change
it you can see both of

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.630
the widgets change.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.400
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One of the
things that you see in this

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.420
world where everything is an
element is you're just using

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.490
these building blocks to build
up larger and larger elements.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.940
And then before you know it,
you've got actually whole

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.115
applications.

00:17:11.115 --> 00:17:14.089
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah, you can do
interesting things with this.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:16.530
We've got a YouTube widget.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.200
Our YouTube widget has got an
I'm feeling lucky property.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.630
Which is reasonably risky.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.740
It's a voice-activated
YouTube widget.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.490
It returns the very first thing
that it searches for,

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.300
which is what makes
it kind of risky.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.640
For demos you can put a
speech input up there.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.390
And we can actually bind the
two things together.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.070
So if I go--

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.300
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So that's just
a regular Joe input with a

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.455
little speech attribute on it.

00:17:36.455 --> 00:17:39.160
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah, this is
the default Chrome HTML5

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.750
speech input.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.390
ERIC BIDELMAN: So native HTML
talking to custom elements

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.960
HTML, if you will.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.190
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Because
effectively a lot of the time,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.190
actually, use elements,
they feel just

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.510
like any other elements.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.370
Ones that are baked into the
platform with the inputs.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.220
MATT MCNULTY: So if I go into
the little binding thing here

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.790
and I say, input.value is equal
to this I'm feeling

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.880
lucky property, and if you can
even look it up in the code.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.590
And you'll see this
is dollars, I

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.180
didn't put that value.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.720
It's still the same thing I
was showing you before.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.950
Now if I come in here,
grumpy cat.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.380
In a second.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.740
Aha, there we go.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.660
It shows it.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.490
So you can see how you can
combine these things together.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.760
And if you imagine you can
actually combine it into a

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.130
really large application.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.800
Like this sandbox itself is
actually all built in polymer.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.090
So one of the ways we can prove
that, we have it on the

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.680
palette here.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.570
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I don't
believe you, man.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.190
Show us.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.480
MATT MCNULTY: Exactly.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.630
I'm lying.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:34.930
We actually have the
whole sandbox

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:35.820
app here on the pallet.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.360
So you can drag it
off as a widget.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.450
And then drag it off
inside of itself.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.570
ERIC BIDELMAN: The whole app
is an element, it's a tag.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.440
It's an HTML tag.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.140
And because of encapsulation,
right?

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.770
Because of Shadown DOM, because
of custom elements you

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.630
can then do things like this.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.105
Which would actually be
crazy hard to do.

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:52.800
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Yeah, it would
require a lot of work to do if

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.820
you're doing it by hand.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.890
But here you sort of get
it for free, almost.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.133
MATT MCNULTY: And encapsulation
ensures that

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.200
none of the semantics
leak at all.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.610
So you can actually get things
inside of things.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.920
And you can combine different
frameworks together.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.350
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
really awesome.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.810
Very cool.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:08.280
Any other demos?

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.800
MATT MCNULTY: No, that's it.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.485
ERIC BIDELMAN: With that.

00:19:10.485 --> 00:19:11.000
That's great.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.860
We learned a little
bit about Polymer.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.690
Let's switch to do some Q&amp;A and
to address some burning

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.990
issues here.

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.312
So first question,
what is your end

00:19:20.312 --> 00:19:21.460
goal in building Polymer?

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.790
What's it's purpose?

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.480
Where does it fit in the
ecosystem of content

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.590
management systems, frameworks,
and libraries.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.070
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I will
take that one.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.540
So I think I already, actually,
kind of answered

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.640
this going through it.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.770
But our primary goal, I said
this in an email in

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.950
polymer-dev I think last
Friday or something.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.930
Our primary goal in Polymer
is to bootstrap a thriving

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:41.055
ecosystem around
Web Components.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:44.320
We think Web Components are
an amazing new technology,

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.390
emerging technology on
the web platform.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.590
And we want to make sure that
the community, the ecosystem,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.990
can use them productively and
really get started thinking

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.000
about these in the right way.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.820
That's our primary goal.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.800
We also, of course, as a
secondary goal to that, is to

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.170
have instead of amazing
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:01.950
UI widgets.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:03.690
So these are just web components
that can be used

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.720
like any other set.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.400
And, of course, Polymer is
designed to be layered.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.500
So you can take what you want
and don't take the parts you

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:09.920
don't want.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.530
So if you want to use
a different sort of

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.810
widgets, it's A-OK.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.180
ERIC BIDELMAN: I think
especially important to show,

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.650
with all these new standards
coming out, right?

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.030
Under on the web components
umbrella, MDV, Shadow DOM, all

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.850
this new stuff.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.160
It's important to show people
how to use this in an

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:23.900
interesting way.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.860
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And to discover
how to use it too.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:25.730
ERIC BIDELMAN: Discover
how to use it.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.780
I think that's really what
Polymer is trying do with the

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:28.350
whole layer.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.060
The UI elements, the regular
elements, and down to the core

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.880
foundational layer.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.545
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And there's
still great questions going on

00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:36.590
in polymer-dev about, well
why'd you do it this way?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.355
Is this really the right way?

00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:39.000
We don't know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.470
We need to discover this as a
community and figure this out.

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.590
MATT MCNULTY: This is still very
much a work in progress.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.530
It's changing constantly.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.860
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And because
this is such an

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.280
exciting and new area.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.910
The team that's been working on
this has worked on, what,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.330
like five or six different
frameworks before.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.190
And this is not new.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.970
Working on frameworks is not
new, but working with web

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.510
components just is a
total mind shift.

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:58.650
MATT MCNULTY: And embracing
the platform again.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.540
It's kind of old school.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.040
You're going back to using
DOM again, right?

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.950
Everyone always asks us like,
well, how do you actually make

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:05.670
these things happen?

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.970
It's like DOM is
the framework.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.020
That's all you have.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.846
Outside of an element, you're
just using DOM.

00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:12.570
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So the second
part of this question then is

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.250
how does it fit within the
ecosystem of content

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.050
management systems,

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.000
frameworks, and other libraries.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.680
So the existing stuff
really allows you to

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.610
be productive today.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.260
And Polymer, again, we support
the modern browsers--

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.140
ERIC BIDELMAN: Evergreen
browsers.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.400
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Evergreen
browsers is the way that we

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.780
describe it.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.780
A lot of things today that are
deployed that people are using

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.810
very successfully are targeted
to the web of today.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.040
And we are trying
to help build a

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.740
better web of tomorrow.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.880
And so it's fundamentally a
different kind of a framework

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.980
because it's one of our goals is
to take this feedback back

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.880
into the standardization
process.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.970
To not play fast and loose and
say, oh this doesn't work.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:47.780
We'll just do this
other thing.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.010
No, no, no, let's fix
that thing, right?

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.000
So that everyone else
can benefit from it.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.870
ERIC BIDELMAN: And like we
said before, there's been

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.230
numerous framework authors that
have come on our mailings

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.980
and said they're fully
supportive of where things are

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.240
headed with the platform
stuff, Shadow DOM, Web

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.030
Components, custom elements.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.300
They can embrace some of these
lower level technologies and

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.070
then use that within their
own framework.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.170
So I think it fits
in really well.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.410
If you think of web development
as a holistic

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.330
approach with all this stuff
that's happening.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.210
ALEX KOMOROSKE: I think there's
definitely, the use of

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.940
the polymer-dev mailing list
has become sort of the de

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:20.520
facto place where people talk
about web components concepts.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.960
So Polymer is bigger than
just Polymer, per se.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.680
It's Web Components that we're
talking about a lot here.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.270
MATT MCNULTY: This is one of the
first things that actually

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.340
puts all of these things
together and shows you how to

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.880
build and what you can do.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.250
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.715
Is Polymer already being used
in some Google projects?

00:22:35.715 --> 00:22:38.620
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So Polymer
is in pre alpha.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.150
Which means that if you aren't
OK with it breaking without

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.640
warning, it's not ready
for you yet.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.025
MATT MCNULTY: If there was a
Greek letter that was before A

00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.230
we would be calling it that.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.530
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And then
the thing is, it's

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.650
actually pretty solid.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.740
You should definitely
play around with it.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.790
And if you're using it for
production stuff, let us know.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:22:59.630
Let us know what breaks,
what doesn't work.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.310
Where it's not working
for you.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.940
But at this point it's
definitely too early for major

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.490
Google projects to
be using this.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.520
But I will say, I've been
interested to see all the

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.590
excitement coming from
teams internally too.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.410
So we're seeing a lot of the
excitement externally.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.740
People are interested in this
stuff and following along.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.140
ERIC BIDELMAN: I was just going
to point out that when

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.530
we first talked about I/O, one
of the Google engineers,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.690
actually, was building a
performance dash for Chrome.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.040
And ended up using Polymer.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.090
Wanted to get nitty gritty
with custom elements.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.010
And so she ended up building
a dashboard in Polymer.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.060
And using custom elements,
eliminating a lot of

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.660
boilerplate code, fixing bugs
she always had issues with.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.650
It's really cool stuff.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.720
And I think we've seen a lot
of internal interest from

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.480
different teams and engineers at
Google really excited about

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.390
where this web platform
stuff is going.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.330
MATT MCNULTY: Yeah, she did it
actually without any help.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.360
ERIC BIDELMAN: Very cool.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.150
MATT MCNULTY: Where is
the file for this?

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.450
A couple week later it was like,
hey, here's the thing.

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.780
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Annie's also
an amazing engineer, too.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.560
But we're seeing, already,
interest in smaller projects

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.130
like this are using it.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:58.470
And I think, over time,
naturally, as smaller projects

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.350
had success, that means it
allows larger products to take

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.250
it seriously and really use
it for real things.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.920
And it works up from there.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.240
So not yet.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.860
But that's because it's very,
very, very early days.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.800
And we wouldn't encourage them
to use it at this point.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.216
ERIC BIDELMAN: Cool.

00:24:13.216 --> 00:24:16.170
What browsers does Polymer
support in its polyfills?

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.550
Are there any plans
to support all the

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.360
versions of this browser?

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.860
I actually ask this because
this comes up a lot.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.224
ALEX KOMOROSKE: See I
recognize that name.

00:24:22.224 --> 00:24:24.120
ERIC BIDELMAN: Weird.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.150
And so I just want to touch
up on the point.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.660
We're trying to support the
latest and greatest of every

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:29.310
bottom browser.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.360
And that includes the Evergreen
browsers, the latest

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.510
version of IE, the latest
version of Chrome.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.240
And it's really because we want
to evolve this as the web

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.180
platform evolves, as well.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.270
You can't do that you if you are
looking back in the rear

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.880
view mirror as Alex
said before.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.310
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So there's
definitely, this isn't like a

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.210
hard line stance of older
browsers are terrible.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.080
We need to make sure that we're
focusing on the future.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.600
So if it's possible in some
cases, every so often, oh, it

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.410
just basically works in older
versions of IE or whatever, in

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.060
some cases.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.250
And it's fine.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.230
ERIC BIDELMAN: And sometimes,
too, it's

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.170
an engineering problem.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.100
Sometimes you just can't
polyfill Shadow DOM and the

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.150
beast that it is browsers like
older versions of IE.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.670
It's impossible.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.190
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Shadow DOM
polyfill is already an amazing

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.550
work of engineering from Erik
Arvidsson, who's an amazing

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:13.220
engineer as well.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.050
MATT MCNULTY: And we're saying
too that you can't actually

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.380
polyfill everything.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.180
So there are certain features,
there are certain aspects of

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.200
things that aren't there yet.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.660
ERIC BIDELMAN: That's
a really good point.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.570
MATT MCNULTY: We try
and do our best to

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:23.510
highlight what those are.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.840
ERIC BIDELMAN: Right.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.210
So we have, some are polyfills
and some are, I would call

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.040
more of a shim, right?

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.520
It tries to mimic as much
as possible the need of

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.900
functionality.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.060
Things like CSS scoping
is very hard to do.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.730
Is there a trade off when
using a Polymer element?

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.200
We gain the benefits of the
Polymer framework, but with

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.490
the added dependency.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.835
Alternatively you could build
a custom element, just a raw

00:25:42.835 --> 00:25:44.350
straight custom element
in CSS JavaScript.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.270
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So one thing I
want to clarify really quickly

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.220
is, again we're using these
standards and we're feeding

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.230
back into them.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.720
And they're evolving as we
speak in response to some

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.580
other things that we and others
are saying in these

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.870
standards list.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.850
And so custom elements,
actually, as of right now, I

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.280
believe it doesn't have the
eclarative syntax that we were

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.260
using in early versions of
Polymer is temporarily on hold

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.190
while they figure out the
imperative bits and get that

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.120
really lined up and
solidified.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.950
And so we didn't want to use
these semantics that may

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.130
change in the future.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.490
And so Polymer element allows
us to experiment and provide

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:19.880
something that was like,
we think this is a good

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.070
way of doing it.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.110
And that will feedback into the
standardization process.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.310
And we'll see ultimately,
hopefully, you just use

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.300
roughly element.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.920
MATT MCNULTY: So obviously we're
biased, I think Polymer

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.070
is totally worth it.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.610
But on thing to point out is
it's a very, very thin layer.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.030
Actually it's the thinnest layer
we can possibly make it.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.040
And the goal is as these
standards evolve and as more

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.370
of what we consider best
practices turn into the

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.400
platform, it gets even
thinner over time.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.440
Dom is the framework, that means
we don't have to create

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.640
one in JavaScript.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.110
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So, again,
we've talked about this

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.660
multiple times throughout this,
but our goal is when we

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.080
see something in the emerging
standards that, we're going to

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.730
work around that.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:56.270
No, no, no.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.640
We go back and we bring this
feedback back to the standards

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.730
guys and work collaboratively
to solve that.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.020
This is just an example of you
watching it in motion.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.140
MATT MCNULTY: And there are some
people working with the

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.240
polyfills directly that are on
the mailing list as well.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.940
And a lot of times they find
themselves looking at the

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.985
Polymer file just
for a reference.

00:27:13.985 --> 00:27:16.140
ERIC BIDELMAN: And part of the
change, actually, I will say

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.660
with the Polymer element, is
that we took some feedback,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.650
actually, from developers
on the mailing list.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.960
They want to do things
like render CSP,

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.720
Context Security Policy.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.490
And they wanted to separate
their script from the actual

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.990
element declarative
definition.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.240
And so that is part of the
Polymer element change as well

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.980
is to bootstrap that a little
easier now before the native

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.540
stuff is ready.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.712
Cool.

00:27:36.712 --> 00:27:39.910
Where are we guys?

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.595
Why must custom element
names have a dash?

00:27:42.595 --> 00:27:44.530
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So this
is a spec requirement.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.400
And the reason that it's in
there, and I hope I don't

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.690
butcher this.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.310
But the reason it's in there
is because when you're

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.800
developing new specs you want
to make sure that you don't

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.480
accidentally break
existing content.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.190
So you don't want to stomp on
people's feet what they've

00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:59.170
already done.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.940
And so we're giving people
a very powerful new

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.530
functionality.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.700
And say we, the web component
standards.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.420
A very powerful functionality.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:10.790
So say everyone starts going off
and creating tags one and

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.660
then later we want to formally
standardize that.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.130
We ship it with slightly
different semantics.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.550
Well now we've just
broken content.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.950
And so the idea of having a
dash is that basically new

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:22.290
things that are built into the
platform won't have a dash.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:25.310
And so we guarantee that the
user LAN components won't ever

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:27.210
conflict with [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.380
MATT MCNULTY: It's a really good
example of the feedback

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.380
to the spec process.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.780
Because originally about a year
ago you had to have an x

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.690
dash every single tag.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.600
And the first time we started
actually using that we have

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.480
all of these tags and every
single one of them had an x

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.300
tag in them.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.840
It was like, OK, this
is not ideal.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.840
If there's something we can do
to actually make that easier,

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.690
that would be great.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.340
So we switched to just has a
dash as the minimum we could

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.130
come up with.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.460
ERIC BIDELMAN: Why do you use
the ng-app tag at Google I/O.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.706
Something to do with
AngularJS?

00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:01.185
MATT MCNULTY: I don't
believe we did.

00:29:01.185 --> 00:29:03.400
ERIC BIDELMAN: There was a video
but it had the g dash

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.210
app, right?

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:04.950
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Oh yes.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:06.260
That's the confusing.

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:09.780
So that video that we showed is
kind of like our vision of

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.460
where we want to go.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.570
MATT MCNULTY: Halo video.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: And so that
actually is a g dash app.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.050
And the idea there was just
showing off components in the

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.870
way how Web Components work to
set a future picture of how it

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.870
could work in the future
when you build apps.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.030
So actually, gs app
is a real thing.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.820
It's not ngApp.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.560
It's not really to the
angular concept.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.680
It's just we needed a name
to put in that video.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.810
ERIC BIDELMAN: It
is confusing.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.020
Like Linus was up on stage.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.080
There was an awesome
video, right?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.200
It was very inspirational
and everything.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.290
But people like think
Google is building

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.690
new elements in HTML.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.720
No.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.410
It was to show the custom
elements stuff.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.602
And we just happened to have the
dash as the first part of

00:29:45.602 --> 00:29:45.940
that phrase.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.660
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That's funny, I
haven't heard that confusion

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.040
before, but I can see why.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.063
That makes total sense.

00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:52.270
ERIC BIDELMAN: How does Polymer
work with AngularJS

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:52.850
That's interesting.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.570
ALEX KOMOROSKE: That is
an interesting one.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.370
So first of all, Angular
is amazing framework.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.890
What's so cool about what
Angular has done is they've

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.410
helped people think
declaratively.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.100
Lots of other framers
haven't done that.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.370
So that's really cool.

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.150
Polymer and web components, the
idea is that when you get

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:11.380
a reference to this component,
it's just a component.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.210
It emits events.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.010
It takes attributes.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.820
It has imperative
methods on it.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.220
And so when you're using these
things, your other framework

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.250
shouldn't have to
know about them.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.490
They're just elements, right?

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.180
They're just like
any other ones.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.450
It's when you want to use some
of the extra sugaring features

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.650
or extra capabilities built into
Polymer and Angular that

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.610
it doesn't really work perfectly
right now, I think.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.300
ERIC BIDELMAN: Yeah, so you can
absolutely today build an

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.130
app that uses parts
of Angular.

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.600
One thing that's nice about
Angular, you can pick and

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.800
choose in Angular as well.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.760
Part of your app
can be Angular.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.930
The whole thing can
be Angular.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.890
And it's sort of the same
with Polymer as well.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.800
You can make, like Matt
just showed, right?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.395
You can make an entire
sandbox that's a tag.

00:30:45.395 --> 00:30:46.235
That's a Polymer app.

00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:48.640
And with inside of it, there's
other Polymer elements.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.840
So by itself, these
two frameworks can

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.850
work absolutely together.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.830
You can create a component
here in Angular.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.210
Component here in Polymer.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:54.860
Custom elements.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.120
And they work really
well together.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.300
I think one thing I've seen is
people trying to use like a

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.180
framework inside of Polymer and
that's where it starts to

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:02.000
get challenging.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.730
And that's really due to the
complications of Shadow DOM

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.200
Because a lot these frameworks,
jQuery, et cetera.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.050
And APIs, actually service
APIs, expect to be in the

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:11.300
global name space.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.850
They expect to have a window
object, for instance.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:16.810
And so now we're switching this
paradigm of encapsulation

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.350
where there's Shadow DOM
in other things.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.185
And you're not in that
same global context.

00:31:20.185 --> 00:31:21.790
So you have to compartmentalize

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.140
functionality.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.370
MATT MCNULTY: We like thinking
about there's a barrier at the

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.910
inside of an element versus the
outside of the element.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:28.530
And if you have two different
things on the inside of the

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.040
element, that's going
to be a problem.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.640
But if you have a different
thing on the outside of the

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.900
element than inside the
element, you're fine.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.010
ERIC BIDELMAN: It's like who
understands the mustache

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.700
syntax when you're inside
of a [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.120
Polymer or Angular, it's hard.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.650
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So outside
doesn't matter who you're

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:40.960
using it with.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.030
It's inside where you pick
one to work with.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.990
ERIC BIDELMAN: Right.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.970
Cool.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.530
Did I lose my place again?

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.330
Are there any Polymer Web
Components build tools for

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.640
concatenating and minifying
Web Components?

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.530
I'll just take a stab at
this real quickly.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.800
I think it's very early days
for tooling for Web

00:31:58.800 --> 00:31:59.750
Components.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.190
I'm particularly excited about
where things can go for this

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.300
sort of thing.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.740
A lot of people have asked us
really great questions on our

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.970
mailing lists and
RFC channels.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.960
It's going to be important, when
you have a slew of these

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.200
custom elements that you're
building, you want to then

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.310
have your normal bill process.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.420
You went to concatenate
things.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:14.960
You want to [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.400
JavaScript, combine everything,
and have those

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.940
good best practices.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.860
Again, really early, we've
already started experimenting

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.680
with some of this becomes it's
come up enough that we should

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.930
obviously start thinking
about it now.

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.570
So Daniel on the team has
actually written a little node

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.310
tool that can sort of compress
and concatenate all your

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.520
elements into one.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.570
MATT MCNULTY: It's called
Vulcanizer.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.040
ERIC BIDELMAN: Vulcaniler.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.920
Pretty gnarly name.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.790
ALEX KOMOROSKE: But I think that
one thing to emphasize as

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:41.400
well is HTML imports allows you
to package up components

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.720
as an HTML file.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.950
We don't yet know what the best

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.190
practices are to use that.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:46.440
And so I think it's
really early.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.330
We're still trying to explore
what that looks like.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.320
We're talking to various
networking experts in the

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.580
specification process to really
figure out what are the

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.570
best practices.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.550
And so we don't yet know.

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.380
It will probably have some
sort of concatenation and

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.260
minifying, but we don't exactly
know what it's going

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.370
to look like.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.685
Because it's early.

00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:05.935
ERIC BIDELMAN: It is early.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:09.570
Cool.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:12.500
Will you be aiming and making
the transition from Polymer to

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500
real web components when
they are ready?

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Switch
back to the diagram.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.330
This is a common
misconception.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.710
So Polymer, actually, when we
say Polymer we mean a bunch of

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.350
different things.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.540
And in this diagram, the brown
on the left shows what Polymer

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.090
means when we talk about it.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.180
ERIC BIDELMAN: Alex is
right over here.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.020
ALEX KOMOROSKE: Thank you thank
you for pointing to that

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:29.880
with your pointing device.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.272
ERIC BIDELMAN: I don't know how
well the brown shows up on

00:33:31.272 --> 00:33:31.932
the screen.

00:33:31.932 --> 00:33:34.730
ALEX KOMOROSKE: So
the red later,

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.640
ultimately, is just the standards.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.830
It's just polyfills.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.340
And when those are implemented
natively across all the

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.320
different browsers,
it just goes away.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.870
These are Web Components.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.410
And so the layer of the yellow
and the green, those are sort

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.700
of sugar an opinion that
Polymer adds on.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.740
But they are web components.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.630
These are not some special,
crazy other world.

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.565
And so this might be referring
to the Polymer

00:33:56.565 --> 00:33:57.680
element versus element.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.490
And, again, we answer that
earlier a few minutes ago.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:01.910
MATT MCNULTY: It could also
be the transition

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.980
to Native as well.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.580
So right now in Chrome Canary,
Polymer is using native

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.199
Shadown DOM optionally.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.699
And very soon, hopefully, we'll
have some of the other

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:13.870
pieces in Native as well.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:16.840
So as those things transition,
you'll see different browsers

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.010
move to Native as we go along.

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.679
And, again, Polymer is going
to try and be that

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.140
thin layer on top.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.940
ERIC BIDELMAN: So the
answer is yes.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.575
ALEX KOMOROSKE: We're
already there.

00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:29.510
ERIC BIDELMAN: So I think
we're out of questions.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.179
We really appreciate
you guys tuning in.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:33.500
And definitely we would like
to have more of these.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.000
If you're interested in checking
out Polymer, the URL

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.270
for documentation in the site
is polymer-project.org.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.179
So you can download Polymer
there and all the goodness

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:45.570
that we talked about today.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.084
And learn some of
the features.

00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.920
ALEX KOMOROSKE: One thing I will
say too, if you have any

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.739
ideas for things you want
to hear talk about.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:52.020
You want to talk to Dimitri
about Web Components specs.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.179
You want to talk to
Dominic about

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:55.170
implementing these in Blink.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.040
You want to talk to Scott
about some of the

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.070
architecture decisions.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.840
Or Steve about some of the
specifics of how this whole.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.330
Let us know.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.670
We're looking for ideas
of other things

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.480
that we talk about.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:06.740
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.510
polymer-dev or whatever
you want to do.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.570
ERIC BIDELMAN: Totally.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.870
Polymer-dev at Google Groups is
our mailing list if you're

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:13.630
interested in talking with us.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.600
ALEX KOMOROSKE: A lot
of really good

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.410
conversation there.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.300
ERIC BIDELMAN: Good stuff.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:16.890
Cool.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:17.760
We're signing off online.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.690
We really appreciate
you guys's time.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:19.940
Thanks for joining us.
