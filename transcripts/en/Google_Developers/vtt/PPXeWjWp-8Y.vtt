00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.020
PAUL IRISH: Hello.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.660
Welcome to The Breakpoint,
Episode 2.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.250
We're going to be talking
about how to be more

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.170
productive doing Web-Op
development.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.670
And today we got some
really good stuff.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.020
We're focusing on the Chrome
DevTools in this episode, and

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.259
specifically we're going to show
off some of the abilities

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.940
to debug your SASS
style sheets.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.310
So with me over in London
is Addy Osmani.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.900
And Addy's just going to get
right into it and show you

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.340
kind of how SASS debugging works
inside Chrome DevTools.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.810
ADDY OSMANI: Awesome.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.800
So the first thing we're going
to look at today, as Paul was

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.780
saying, are some brand new
features in the DevTools for

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.530
people that love working
with SASS.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.165
So I'm going to go over
to my screen.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.190
Now let's fire up
the DevTools.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.460
OK.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.000
So I've got a SASS project in
front of me at the moment.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.800
Now, the first thing you
probably want to do with this

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.760
is start inspecting stuff.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.660
So we've got a header
at the moment.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.090
Let's inspect it.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.960
So I've got my header in
front of me right now.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.890
I can go and I can do
some awesome stuff.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.910
I can like bump up
the font size.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.750
It looks hot, it looks sexy.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.610
And what's even better is that
I can now go and click on

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.830
style.css to see the original
file in the source view.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.540
Now this is great, except you
can see there's some line

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.100
numbers here.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.090
It does show me my selector, but
because I'm using SASS--

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.770
and this is actually the
compiled version of my style

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.090
sheet file--

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.530
any changes that I make in this
file are only going to be

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.780
reflected in that.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.720
It's not going to be reflected
in the original SASS file.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.800
And whenever I go and I try
compiling my source files,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.950
these changes that I make to
this file are going to get

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.860
overwritten.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.340
So what we do that's
better than this?

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.830
Now, last week we showed you
that if you go to Chrome

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.600
flags-- so let's do that very
quickly, so Chrome flags--

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.870
you can actually enable
some experiments.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.850
So let's go to Developer
Tools.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.550
The first thing you want to do
is Enable Developer Tools

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.630
Experiments.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.595
Now, normally you'll have to
refresh your browser after

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:20.800
that, but once you do and you go
to the Settings tab, you'll

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.110
see that there's an Experiments
tab there.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.710
Now, the option that we're
interested in is the one that

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.540
says Support for SASS.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150
So let's enable that.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.380
Now, after you've enabled
Support for SAAS, you're going

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.420
to need to reload the DevTools
and refresh the page.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.010
So we're going to do
that very quickly.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.750
And let's open up the
DevTools once again.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.610
Now if I go back to Elements
and we inspect our h1 once

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.550
again, what you'll see is that
we've now got access

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.300
to styles at SCSS.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.290
And if I click into this, I can
actually edit with syntax

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.900
highlighting my original
SAAS file.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.600
Well, this is really cool.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.860
You've got the nesting.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.550
You can see all of your
beautiful SASS

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.860
source, which is great.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.500
And I can make changes
to this.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.300
Now, before you actually make
changes, if you want them to

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.550
be visible in DevTools, you
need to go and save this.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.440
So I'm just going to do Command
S to save this.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.900
Alternatively, you can right
click and do Save As and save

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.900
it to the original location
that you were working in.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.310
And now I can just go and
make changes to this.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.190
So before I make changes, just
to let you know, so I'm

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.490
currently running LiveReload
and SASS --watch in the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.040
background.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.300
So it's keeping an eye
on what I'm doing.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.580
And if I make a change--
so I've just

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.870
bumped up the font size.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.770
Let's Command S to save that.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.770
So what you've seen is it's
gone, and without me having to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.080
reload the page or anything,
it's compiled my SASS file.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.800
It's gone and it's reloaded
the page.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.225
So I'm actually seeing the
changes in real time of what

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:55.740
I've done in my source file.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.950
And that's cool.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.750
Let's [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.570
that back and save it.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:00.980
Now, there's a mixin.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.280
So what I'm actually going
to do, I want to make

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.170
a change to a mixin.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.880
So we've got a text shadow on
HTML5 PLEASE at the moment,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.960
which is cool.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.360
Now, let's say that I started
editing and I wanted to make

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.900
some changes.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.130
And maybe I went and did Command
Save without knowing

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.790
that I made a mistake.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.410
Now, normally with your CSS
editing workflow, there's no

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.670
sort of [INAUDIBLE] or error
message to tell you you've

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.330
done something wrong, that
something's been messed up.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.860
But here, as you can see--
because I've got like

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.350
LiveReload and all my other
tools running in the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.140
background--

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.470
I get some nice error messages
that say, OK, well, there's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.110
some invalid CSS.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.060
And it'll tell you exactly what
you've been doing wrong.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.530
Now, in my case, I actually
want to replace this

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.960
completely.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.900
So let's first dismiss this.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.740
Now, in my case, I actually
want to go and use a mixin

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.250
that I previously defined.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.530
So I just added my mixin and I
do a Commend S once again, and

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.110
there we go.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.720
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.930
ADDY OSMANI: That's
hot, right?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.410
PAUL IRISH: That's
sharp, yeah.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.380
ADDY OSMANI: So that's
really cool.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.230
You've now gotten much better
support for SASS editing in

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.670
the DevTools, and that
will help with

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:08.950
your general workflow.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.740
But on top of that, you've also
got the ability to use

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.310
all the other benefits
that the Sources

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.170
panel still gives you.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.610
So if I went to, say, Local
Modifications--

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.940
so we were showing you a little
bit of this last week.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.340
So if I go to Local
Modifications, I actually get

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.950
complete editing history.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.550
So I can revert back to any
point in my editing workflow

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.460
without having to go anywhere
outside the DevTools.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.930
And it feels so nice to
be able to do that.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.220
So, yeah, I think that's
it for the SASS

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.650
portion of my demo.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.980
What did you think, Paul?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.000
PAUL IRISH: That's pretty hot.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.140
So I think it's cool because
typically you're in a

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.440
situation where you're just
editing your SASS, and then

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.390
you compile it down, and then
you'll make a change and

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.680
you'll be like, well, somehow I
have to transport the change

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.050
I just made in the DevTools back
to the original, like the

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.880
way that I authored it.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.770
And it's a bit awkward.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.440
And here you can just develop
directly inside the tool and

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.960
get your immediate feedback that
you want, but you don't

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.640
have to be translating back and
forth between your SASS

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.890
and your CSS.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.840
So that's really dope.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.820
I dig it.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.160
ADDY OSMANI: I like it.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.226
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:15.590
All right.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.950
So now that we've got SASS under
control, we've got some

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.720
more things to show you.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.130
First we're going to show you
some cool things in the Chrome

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.660
DevTools Console.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.520
Then we're going to show you
skinning and customizing the

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.400
theme and look of the Chrome
DevTools, some deeper

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.280
inspection features inside
the DevTools, and some

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.390
goodies at the end.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.940
But I'm going to show you some
good stuff in the Console.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.750
Now, the first thing is, if
you've ever worked on a page

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.760
that, for instance, doesn't have
jQuery, doesn't have a

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.300
dollar function to find, and you
open up the console, and

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.850
then you type dollar, and you
start to pass in what normally

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.390
you would be saying to jQuery,
and it works or it doesn't, or

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.340
it returns an empty set, and
you're like, why is there a

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.380
dollar available inside my
console when I don't have it

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.720
on the page?--

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.720
this is the command line API.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.100
So I'm going to show a little
bit of what's going on here.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.790
There was a good question on
Stack Overflow a bit ago about

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.910
why there is a dollar and

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.160
double-dollar inside the DevTools.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.590
So this actually comes
originally from Firebug.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.590
It's the command line API.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.970
These are all things that are
available within the context

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.270
of the Console.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:40.950
So we have dollar, double
dollar, XPath, dollar-zero,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.240
which represents the
Yeoman you have

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.050
selected, and even Inspect.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.350
You can pass an element into
Inspect, and it'll go over to

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.600
the Elements panel, and you'll
be viewing that.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.000
So some really cool
stuff in here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.420
But people have been curious
about why double-dollar is

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.800
selector and why single-dollar
has been ID.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.820
And the funny situation is that
this is all about kind of

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.980
JavaScript history.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.090
Double-dollar was originally
used by prototype.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:18.840
And it was used as a way to grab
all the selectors, but

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.730
then jQuery was like,
you know, we'll just

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.890
throw that on dollar.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.550
And so now there's been this
weird situation where the

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.250
legacy of double-dollar has been
what's available inside

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.049
Chrome DevTools and Firebug and
Opera Dragonfly, but at

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.880
the same time everyone's used
to grabbing selectors, not

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.080
IDs, with single-dollar.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:44.020
So Addy and I met up this summer
to work on some Chrome

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.180
DevTool stuff, and we were like,
this comes up and now

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.920
and again, and we were like,
we should probably change

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.880
this, right?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.800
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, right.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.540
PAUL IRISH: So we went in and
we talked to some of the

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.440
developers behind Firebug and
the Firefox DevTools, and we

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.250
talked to the Dragonfly
guys, and we're like,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.040
let's change this?

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.040
I guess that's how it worked.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.440
ADDY OSMANI: Pretty much.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.150
PAUL IRISH: And so basically we
changed the definition of

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.240
dollar inside the command line
API in these developer tools.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.650
So let's just show a little demo
of how this works now.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.680
So I'm going to ask for--

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.700
this is the way that
it used to work.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:40.130
You'd pass in an ID to dollar,
and it would grab that element

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.220
with that ID.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.880
ADDY OSMANI: But that
just feels a little

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.590
bit awkward, right?

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.880
Because you're used to using
jQuery these days with dollar

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.230
sign, and maybe you want to be
able to stick other characters

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.045
in front of it or use
classes and all that

00:09:52.045 --> 00:09:52.970
other stuff, right?

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.750
PAUL IRISH: Right, yeah.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.640
So now what we did is we changed
it, but then we also

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.190
made sure that there is a kind
of like a little catch so that

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:03.220
you're not totally
confused when it

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:03.980
doesn't return anything.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.010
So it lets you know that indeed
there is a fallback

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.340
situation here.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.030
And so it'll recommend that you
throw in the pound, then

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.790
you get that.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.190
So this works for everything.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.220
I could be passing it proper
selectors, and it will always

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.350
return the first element
that matches.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.830
It basically works like
Query selector.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.230
So it's a breaking change.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.080
It's a little backwards
incompatible, but we think

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.940
that it matches the common 2012
use of dollar and kind of

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.500
fits expectations a
little bit better.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.880
So I also wanted to show some
other good stuff in here.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.810
Another feature that was added
somewhat recently into the

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.350
Chrome DevTools Console
is dollar-underscore.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:01.180
And so I believe this comes from
a Perl history, but it

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.540
essentially refers to the

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.840
previously evaluated statement.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:11.380
So I'm going to go and grab
hp logo, offset width.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.460
Cool.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.960
And now I'm going to add
a little bit of WebKit

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.500
transition for fun, because
we're going to

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.400
do some good stuff.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.300
And now we're going to change
the width 500 plus

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.430
dollar-underscore plus px.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.130
And so what this is going
to do is it's going

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.970
to grab this 275--

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.470
that was the value we
had right here--

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.040
and use it in place here.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:46.570
So now I evaluate this.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:47.410
Yeah.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.200
ADDY OSMANI: Wow.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.690
That is so awesome.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.141
PAUL IRISH: Definitely against
branding guidelines, but it's

00:11:55.141 --> 00:11:56.380
cool, it's cool.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.510
ADDY OSMANI: You're going to
be getting a call from

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:58.970
marketing any minute now.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.220
PAUL IRISH: Yup, yup.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.310
All right.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.410
So let's bring that back down.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.310
Phew.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.650
OK.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.280
Cool.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.820
So dollar-underscore, a small
, little convenience thing,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.880
but I hope it comes in useful.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.000
I know that I am commonly like
referencing things up and

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.120
down, so it should be good.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.820
Another thing that I wanted to
show real quick is the new

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.180
object preview logging.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.010
So let's see.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.550
I think we have an object.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.280
I was scouting around for
an object earlier.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:32.490
Yeah.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.060
Here we go.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.490
So this is just some weird
object that's available on the

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.440
Google homepage.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.290
Don't even know what it is.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.990
But normally if you had in
your application code

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.920
something like console log, and
you did something like you

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.990
were logging out this thing,
then you would get this little

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.250
object's name, and you get the
triangle, and then you come

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.400
over here and you click it.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:02.480
And that's OK, but we thought
that it would be nicer if you

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.460
got a little preview
of what's going on.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.810
So now when you do this,
you do get a preview.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.990
So it kind of like takes a quick
snapshot of the values

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.190
inside the object.

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.930
And so you can see kind
of at a glance.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.800
So this becomes really useful,
especially when

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.200
you have a big object.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.990
Let's grab window and
grab location.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.630
And you can see very quickly
from a console log what some

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.950
of the properties on
this object are.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:37.430
There's also another part of
this, which is that previously

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.390
the values here, when you logged
them out, they were

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.750
lazy evaluated.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:46.380
So this ended up in a situation
where sometimes you

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.750
could log an object, change it,
log it again, and when you

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.420
went back to your console and
opened them back up, they

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.590
would be the same, which
you wouldn't expect.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:59.550
So that essentially got fixed
with this change.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.790
So you get both the preview and
that preview is evaluated

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.116
at log time instead of
at expansion time.

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:07.570
Does that makes sense, Addy?

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:07.990
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.250
Yeah, it does.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.615
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:12.330
OK, good.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:12.530
OK.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:18.020
I think that's it for Console?

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.330
Yeah.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.840
Do you want to show
a little bit?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.990
I know that you made this cool
post on Google+ a little bit

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:29.460
ago about theming and skinning
your Chrome DevTools.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.170
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.090
So I was really surprised
at how much

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.220
people wanted this stuff.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.450
It was like that's crazy.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.660
We've got almost 1,000
shares on that.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.805
It's insane.

00:14:41.805 --> 00:14:44.440
So normally when you get a brand
new text editor, the

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.190
first thing a lot of time you do
is you go and try to find a

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:50.380
theme for it that you love,
because you're going to be

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.770
spending a lot of time in
your editor and you

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:54.050
want it to look great.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.540
Sometime, like probably about a
year ago, a great developer

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.640
named Darcy Clarke figured out
that you can go and you can

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.010
actually customise the look
of the Chrome DevTools.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.910
And I'm going to share my screen
for just a minute.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:12.510
So this is Darcy's blog post
I'm going to be showing.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.056
And he started this thread about
how you can go and you

00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:17.970
can customize this, regardless
of what your

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.220
operating system is.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.510
And there are so many
people that were

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.820
interested in this idea.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.620
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.100
ADDY OSMANI: So a year later,
I thought wouldn't it be

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.830
interesting to see where
people took this.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.380
And so I put together this
post where I summarized a

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.280
bunch of the different themes
that people had worked on.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.340
And it went crazy.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.860
And there's probably 20, 30
themes available for the

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.540
DevTools these days.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.790
Let's take a look
at one of them.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.520
So this is a thing
called MNML.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.000
PAUL IRISH: Ah-hum, hum.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.940
ADDY OSMANI: It's building
up, MNML, MNML,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.030
something like that.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.480
But it's really cool.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.950
You can actually customize
almost every single part of

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:03.325
the DevTools--

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:04.290
PAUL IRISH: That's hot.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.950
ADDY OSMANI: --to look like
whatever you want.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.430
There's some people who've like
gotten rid of the text

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.220
next to the icons.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.560
And people have like bumped up
the size of the different

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.120
parts to it.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.080
It's been really interesting.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.380
PAUL IRISH: I would probably
apply like a WebKit transition

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.660
to a lot of things.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.140
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:21.220
PAUL IRISH: And do some
3D transforms.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.950
So instead of like switching
panels, like when you go from

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.150
Console to Elements, it
like does like a 3D,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.925
phowswish, or something.

00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:30.250
Let's put it out there.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.620
I think it would be awesome.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:33.720
ADDY OSMANI: What Paul is saying
is that right after

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.846
this, you can expect motherf'n
Chrome DevTools to come out.

00:16:36.846 --> 00:16:37.760
PAUL IRISH: Ah.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.260
Everyday.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.560
ADDY OSMANI: That's
what he's saying.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.150
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.600
ADDY OSMANI: So on the back of
that post, there's this really

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.240
cool guy named Pascal Kremp
that started working on a

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.540
little gallery of DevTools
themes, which I thought was

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.830
cool, because like as much as
this stuff is up on GitHub

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.410
it's hard to find it.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.390
And you need previews, you need
information about what

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.880
exactly it actually
customizes.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.480
And so he put together this
website called devthemez, so

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.770
D-E-V-T-H-E-M-E-Z dot com.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.099
And it just came out like this
week, but there are already

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.040
sort of theme authors that have
been sticking up their

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.960
themes on this.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.760
And you can just like go into
any theme, take a preview of

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.554
some screenshots of it, go grab
the source and just apply

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:22.609
it to your DevTools.

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:25.400
And I thought it was
just kind of cool.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.150
So, yeah, check it out.

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.410
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.780
And I guess maybe we should
point out that the way that

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.130
this works is that
you're applying--

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.110
there's a bunch of CSS--

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.440
into your Chrome's
user stylesheet.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:36.960
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.430
PAUL IRISH: And it's just scoped
within the DevTools.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.480
But it's just CSS that you're
applying in there.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.040
And so you can do anything
you want.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.090
You could probably use some of
those text shadows that we

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:58.695
showed earlier to really give
some umph to your tools.

00:17:58.695 --> 00:18:01.750
ADDY OSMANI: Definitely.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:03.950
PAUL IRISH: OK.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.050
A little bit more inspection
stuff.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.560
So I'm going to show
a few things.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.540
So with Chrome DevTools now
there's new support for some

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.870
kind of emerging--

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.170
well, have-emerged features--

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.300
so Shadow DOM, IndexedDB,
and FileSystem.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.910
So Shadow DOM is emerging.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.850
It's a fundamental part of the
new web components spec.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.650
And I'm really excited about,
wow, how it's going to affect

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.460
Web-Op development.

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.780
But, in fact, a lot of the
things that are already inside

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.155
the Chrome Developer Tools--

00:18:36.155 --> 00:18:36.770
I'm sorry.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.410
That's already inside of Chrome
and WebKit are built

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.460
with Shadow DOM.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.200
So this is a video element.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:52.600
I have some funny transforms
around it, just for fun, but

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.610
really we're just dealing with
a video element here.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.810
I'm going to Inspect this.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.610
Oh.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.540
Come on.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.730
I'm using a Command Shift C,
which is my favorite keyboard

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.930
shortcut for just diving right
into inspect mode immediately.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.260
And if I open up the video
element, I do see my source

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.760
elements here, but I also
see Shadow-root.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.390
And so this is pretty cool,
because we dive in through

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:26.500
these divs, and now you'll see
we have a button, an input

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.780
type range, a button range,
and so the actual UI--

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:35.280
this is the controls that
ship inside Chrome

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.960
for the video element--

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.290
this is just built with actual
elements with form controls.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:48.610
The input type range actually
has Shadow DOM in it as well.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.360
So it's just made out of divs.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:58.530
So this is a Shadow DOM that
ships inside WebKit, but this

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.070
is available for everything.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:04.030
You can turn it on the same way
that you saw Addy turn on

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.567
the SASS experiment earlier.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.330
Now, let's see.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.200
This is some IndexedDB.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.120
So this is a little demo

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.440
application that uses IndexedDB.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.030
And typically up until now there
hasn't been a good way

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.600
to see what's actually stored in
my IndexedDB inside Chrome.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.000
So, as you can imagine,
now there is.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.400
We dive into Resources, and
inside the application we just

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.600
have a bunch of items.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.870
There are descriptions--

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.310
some and in a cart, some
are in a wish list.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:48.390
And I'm going to add a tablet
into my wish list.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.040
Cool?

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.910
And now when I come down
here, see my IndexedDB?

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:59.980
These are my data stores, one
of them, and wish list.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.990
Here Is my tablet.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.660
So it's just all my objects
that I have

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.220
stored inside my IndexedDB.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.550
And it's available
to peruse here.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:15.860
And I can also filter
right upside here.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.710
The last one is FileSystem.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.240
So the FileSystem API allows
you to save real files and

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.200
folders to the actual disk.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.950
This is great for very large
files, but you can

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.670
use it with a lot.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.720
So let's see.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.740
With this little app, I
can create new folder.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.090
Hello?

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.920
Awesome File TXT.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:46.550
And while I'm at it, I'll also
drag in a JavaScript file.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:51.580
And so this is just adding files
into my local FileSystem

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.110
store, this app.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:59.130
And now I come over into
Resources, and we can see

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.430
what's actually stored here--
the folder that I made, the

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.850
image, the file, and then the
JavaScript and HTML that I

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.000
just dragged in.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.870
So you immediately see what,
in fact, is stored there.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.180
ADDY OSMANI: That's
really slick.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.640
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.190
It's hot.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.040
So if you're using some of these
advanced features, we

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.340
want to make sure that we have
good developer support for you

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.580
to understand how this
is behaving.

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.710
So check those out.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.980
Addy, should we mentioned a
little bit about what's going

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.820
on with Yeoman these days?

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.300
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:31.590
Yeah.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.370
Why not?

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.400
So Yeoman just shipped
a new version quite

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.660
recently, 0.9.4, I believe.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.860
And we've got a lot of work
going on at the moment, trying

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.882
to work on Yeoman 1.0 and the
direction in which you want

00:22:45.882 --> 00:22:47.870
the project to take.

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.330
So some of the things that we're
trying to look at doing

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.760
are upstreaming, some of the
different Yeoman tasks that

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.110
you guys are used to using,
some Grunt, so the broader

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:59.630
Grunt community can
start using those.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.520
And we're trying to see what we
can do about making some of

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.030
our toolings, so things like
our scaffolding, better

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.440
available to broader parts
of the community.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.510
So we're going to try making
sure that if you're a Grunt

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.750
user, a Yeoman user, you
can use those tools

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.240
more recently together.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.750
And we're going to have some
more news about that stuff

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.490
coming up in a future show.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.740
PAUL IRISH: Nice.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.400
Addy, let's do some questions?

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.070
ADDY OSMANI: Questions?

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.520
OK.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.640
PAUL IRISH: We've got some
good ones that came in.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.100
We'll take a few of them.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.290
So let's see.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.990
We haven't read through
this before, so we'll

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.340
just see how it goes.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.890
ADDY OSMANI: No, we haven't.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:37.390
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.650
The latest version of
Safari ships with a

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.350
forked version of DevTools.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:43.390
Does it mean that Apple is
no longer involved in the

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.260
development of standard WebKit
inspectors in collaboration

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.410
between Chrome-Safari teams
in this matter?

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.700
So, the way that it works is
that Inspector has a lot of

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.950
parts, and there's a back end
of Inspector that has the

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.100
instrumentation inside of
a WebKit, and then there

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.130
is the front end.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:07.660
So Chrome DevTools, the front
end of Chrome DevTools is

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:08.680
actually upstreamed.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.600
100% of it is actually present
in the WebKit.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.280
And so that's what's there.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.010
And Safari 6 went in a new
direction as far as its UI,

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.260
and I think it's pretty
cool to see.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.180
And so the instrumentation
is still shared in the

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.490
background.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:30.540
And there's still plenty of

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.540
collaboration between the teams.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.470
New features that are coming
up, both teams are very

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.680
interested in making sure that
we can improve the developer

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.260
experience.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.350
And so things are good.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:45.040
You can just check out the
WebKit bug tracker.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.830
All new features are tracked
there, and you can hop on and

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.330
see both teams working on
the same kind of stuff.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.080
So, yes, it's good.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.690
ADDY OSMANI: Cool.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.230
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.480
Jaruk asks--

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.490
ADDY OSMANI: A lot of these
are from Jaruk.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:02.690
Sorry.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:03.060
Go ahead.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.170
PAUL IRISH: Jaruk asks
good questions.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.810
Yeah, that's good.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.240
Is it possible to observe in
real time which callbacks are

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.100
fired by DOM events?

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.510
I often forget to unsubscribe
from events that are no longer

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.330
needed, which causes them to
accumulate and slow down my

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.580
app with time.

00:25:20.074 --> 00:25:20.553
[SIGH]

00:25:20.553 --> 00:25:21.803
OK.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.310
Yes.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.650
Yes.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.810
Yes.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:28.030
OK.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:32.680
So there's a few ways on this.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:40.430
So if I look at Chrome
DevTools and

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.126
see if we get some--

00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:44.480
Yeah, nice.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.730
OK.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.650
This is the Chrome DevTools
of these Inspector

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.730
questions that I have.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.470
And I'm selecting the body
element right now here.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.320
And we can see all event
listeners that are registered

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.250
for this element.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.430
And we can click into them to
identify exactly where it's

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.990
coming from.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.990
Like I have a Chrome extension
that's registering to click on

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:17.200
the document and then this
minified file that is also

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.270
digging into things.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.900
So you can definitely
see what's bound.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.560
And then if you want to go
a little bit deeper, for

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:34.030
instance, you can break
when event listeners

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.850
are about to be fired.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.480
So let's say that I want
to identify on click

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.750
what's going on.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.400
So let's see if I can do this.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.610
Mouse, click.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:50.930
Yeah.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:51.600
Nice.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.030
ADDY OSMANI: Nice.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:54.250
PAUL IRISH: Very cool.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.900
So now we're breaking and we're
actually breaking inside

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.540
of my event handler.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.430
I'm going to [? predify ?]

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.470
this.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.290
Hope it works.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:02.670
There we go.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.200
Cool.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.510
All right.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.000
So now we're actually broken
inside of the event handler

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.610
for this click, and
if I can just--

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.870
I can hit Play, and if there was
another event handler that

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:18.370
was bound to click for this
action, I would now be broken

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.550
inside of that.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.180
So those are basically your two
good ways to get an idea

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:30.330
of what's still bound
for those elements.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.370
ADDY OSMANI: I'll also add that
if you're having trouble

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.930
with sort of event listeners or
handlers that aren't being

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.390
unsubscribe so you're unbound,
you can also use our profiling

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.350
tools to find those pain points
in your application to

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.990
figure out where particular
amounts of memory are being

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.520
used and so on.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.770
And we're going to try getting
out some better documentation

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.500
about that stuff soon.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:52.770
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.940
Can you share some plans for
DevTools related to a

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.540
responsive design?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.190
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:59.580
I don't mind showing something
about this.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:27:59.824
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:27:59.824 --> 00:27:59.950
Go ahead.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.760
ADDY OSMANI: I'm going
to share my

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.730
screen again very quickly.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.020
Right.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.020
So we briefly mentioned last
week the idea of--

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.400
if you go see Overrides panel,
so again if you've got

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.780
Experiments enabled, you get
all these options, but I do

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.890
believe most of these are
available and stable as well.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.320
But if you go to the Settings
tog and you go to Overrides,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.750
you can override a bunch of
stuff that will help you with

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.580
your responsive design workflow,
including things

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.730
like device metrics.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.160
So if you wanted to go and
override your screen

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.680
resolution, if you wanted
to override your device

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.800
orientation, and so on, so you
can get a feel for the

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.820
different breakpoints in your
media query design flow, these

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.020
tools can help with that.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.730
And if you go back to the
first episode of The

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:43.600
Breakpoint, we actually preview
some of this stuff.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.570
But, yeah, there are definitely
some tools in there

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.540
that will help you with your
responsive design.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.180
Do we have anything
more planned for

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.430
responsive design, Paul?

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.110
PAUL IRISH: That's a good
summary of things.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:29:01.690
I will also point out that
normally the Chrome window, if

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.730
you're just resizing it for
funsies, it will max--

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:09.340
its midwidth will
be 400 pixels.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.390
A lot of people want to
go down to below 360.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:19.230
So if you just dock your
DevTools to the right using

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.450
the bottom-left icon--

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.940
ADDY OSMANI: Actually, Paul,
do you mind if I show that,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.230
because we've been getting a
lot of questions on Stack

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.430
Overflow and its pitter lately
about how you properly dock

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.480
these days in Canary?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.790
So we changed this recently.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.110
So one thing you used to be able
to find was sort of how

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.170
to dock-to-right in
the settings.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.620
But we've changed this
now to be an icon.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.245
So I'm not sure if you
guys can see it.

00:29:42.245 --> 00:29:44.980
I'll bump this up as
much as I can.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.950
So in the left-hand corner, in
the bottom left-hand corner of

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.670
the DevTools, if you click and
hold on the Layout Manager

00:29:52.670 --> 00:30:00.510
icon, it'll change the positions
of this stuff.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.570
It's actually gone and it's
expanded in my case.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:03.750
Oops.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.310
PAUL IRISH: Oh-oh.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.390
ADDY OSMANI: There we go.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:07.900
PAUL IRISH: There you go.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.600
ADDY OSMANI: So click
and hold.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.920
So click and hold on that icon,
and you'll be able to

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.710
dock-to-right once again.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.970
So, yup, it's slightly
different, but it still works.

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.830
Just the same.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:19.690
PAUL IRISH: Yup.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:24.470
So another improvement that just
landed is it'll remember

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.530
what your last date was, and so
you can just keep clicking

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.990
it to toggle between bottom
and right, for instance.

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.970
And we're also going to be--

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.665
I think it landed like
yesterday-- is--

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:35.030
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.960
PAUL IRISH: --per
tab settings.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.040
So let's say in one application
you really want to

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.810
see it, your DevTools, on the
bottom, and in the next tab

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.560
over you really want it
positioned on the right, and

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.190
now you can manage
that just fine.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.610
ADDY OSMANI: Yup.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.130
PAUL IRISH: But for responsive
design, what I was going to

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.850
say was that when it is docked
to right, you can just change

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.080
the split between your DevTools
and your page and

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.230
just bring it all the way down
to like 100 pixels wide.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.360
So that helps a lot when you're
testing media queries,

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.600
for instance.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.500
All right.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.890
We'll do one last question.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.890
This is also coming
in from Jaruk.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:17.310
And he asks why support for
SASS and not just agnostic

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:22.630
[INAUDIBLE] processor support?

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:28.450
So right now SASS was chosen
first, just to kind of like

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.950
test things out, see that it
works, and also SASS already

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.720
had two different debug modes
where it outputted both line

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.600
numbers and a lot of debug
information, and Chrome

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.940
DevTools supports
both of those.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:41.260
So you can compile SASS with
Enable Line Numbers, or I

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.140
think it's called Enable Debug
Info, and Chrome DevTools is

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.980
able to pick up the line number
mappings from that.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:51.360
In the future, we would like
to see SASS output a proper

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.810
source map.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:56.790
And so it can use Source
Map Version 3.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.030
And that's like where things
will be going.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:04.580
If you had LESS or Stylus and
are able to generate a source

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.910
map, then support for them
is really no problem.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.530
And source maps are totally
language agnostic.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:18.180
And so, yeah, I think that's
a summary there.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.330
Oh.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.410
One more thing.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.080
So there's one last feature
inside Chrome DevTools that is

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.710
pretty new.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.330
I wanted to show it.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.260
And this is Styled
Console Messages.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.535
ADDY OSMANI: Prepare to
have your mind blown.

00:32:36.535 --> 00:32:37.000
PAUL IRISH: Shosh.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.690
Wow.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.910
OK.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.850
Typically, your Console log,
it logs, it's good, but

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.860
sometimes you want a little
bit more pizazz, and

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.390
I don't blame you.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.200
So if we take a look at how this
works, if I just paste in

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.720
these two guys, then--

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:56.120
Yeah.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.816
Check that out.

00:32:57.816 --> 00:32:58.550
ADDY OSMANI: Wow.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.750
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:04.780
So Firebug has supported this
for a little bit of time.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:10.130
And so we do a percent C, and
then we take the last argument

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.330
that's sent to log, and this
is just a bunch of CSS

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.470
that we send over.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.790
And that just applies
into there.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.940
ADDY OSMANI: And I can include
any CSS that I want in there.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.670
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:22.710
There's no--

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.550
I don't think there's
a blacklist or

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.350
a white list, so--

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.310
ADDY OSMANI: You can see where
we're going with this, right?

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.430
PAUL IRISH: All right.

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.050
So I'm going to bring up
one that I prepared

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.560
a little bit ago.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.020
I have it over in my Snippets.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.270
And so let's take a short
little message.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.020
And instead of a background in
color, we're going to kind of

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.140
turn it up a little bit, add a
bit more CSS, and now we're

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.220
just going to use straight
up Console dot log.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.070
Now, to send this to the
Console, I can just click this

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.725
Run icon down at the bottom.

00:33:57.725 --> 00:34:00.530
Ah, yeah.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.780
This is my Console.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.590
It's pretty good looking.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.620
You can do anything
you want here.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:13.199
And I think it's really
important to

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.000
communicate with pizazz.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.880
ADDY OSMANI: Gradients, with
gradients, is what he's

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.880
saying, with as many gradients
as possible.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.170
PAUL IRISH: I like it.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:21.770
All right.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.179
I think that's it for this
episode of The Breakpoint.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:25.420
ADDY OSMANI: That's it.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.480
MODERATOR: We do have
some late-breaking

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.810
questions on YouTube.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:28.130
PAUL IRISH: Oh, yeah?

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:28.560
MODERATOR: Yeah.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.730
So what they want to know is
if you guys are allowing

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.790
developers to use Yeoman
with existing apps like

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.010
PAUL IRISH: Ah.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:36.810
Good question.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.070
Yup.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.480
So we play this a little bit.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.420
Addy, do you want
to tackle this?

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:42.780
ADDY OSMANI: Sure.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:46.310
So we've had a lot of feedback
from developers in different

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:49.840
communities, from PHP, from
Rails, from [INAUDIBLE], and

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.380
everyone wants to be able to
use some sort of backend in

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.030
Yeoman, because if you're
building a web app, you're

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.949
going to have to have some sort
of backend that's for

00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:00.420
data search, right, or just
being a server side processor?

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.300
Now, what we're going to be
doing in the coming months is

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.610
trying to improve your workflow
so that's it's easier

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.315
for you to hook into a different
backend, or hook

00:35:08.315 --> 00:35:09.840
into a different
build process.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.160
If you've already got sort of
an existing backend build

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.530
process for your Rudy app
or your Rails app, or

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.180
whathaveyou, this is something
that we're still working on at

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.050
the moment.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.860
But there are people that are
sort of already hacking on

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.960
this with Yeoman, and we're
going to do our best to share

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.960
as much of that stuff as
possible on the Yeoman group.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.920
But I think given another few
months, the Yeoman story with

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.350
other backends is going to
be much, much better.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:37.950
PAUL IRISH: Yes.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:43.260
You can google Yeoman PHP
and see an attempt by

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.895
Felix, Felix Gnass.

00:35:44.895 --> 00:35:45.200
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.720
PAUL IRISH: He wrote a little
bit of node middleware that

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:52.230
will pull in a PHP server
for the preview server.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.900
The challenge here is that we
really want to be able to

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.360
still provide the LiveReload
functionality in the preview

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.190
environment, so we have the live
recompilation of SASS,

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.570
copy script, et cetera--

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.070
the LiveReload, so that the
iteration flow is really

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:09.600
solid, but we're still able
to host this using

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.710
your standard backend.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:13.140
So we just want to make sure
that the way that this is

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:17.480
implemented scales extremely
well and still gives you that

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.180
sort of iteration workflow
that you want.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:20.450
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:21.530
And we want to do it right.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.955
We realize that you guys have
got very different stacks all

00:36:24.955 --> 00:36:27.450
over the place, and so we want
to do our best to make sure we

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:29.974
spur as much of the stuff as
possible if you guys want to

00:36:29.974 --> 00:36:30.610
hack at it.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:30.950
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.270
All right.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.860
I guess that will do it.

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.670
So thank you guys very
much for watching.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.340
See you next time.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.590
ADDY OSMANI: Thank you.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.810
