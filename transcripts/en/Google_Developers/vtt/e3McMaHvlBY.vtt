Hi, my name is Brian Kennish.
I'm a developer advocate on the Google Chrome

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.719
team.
And I'm going to show you how to build Google

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.702
Chrome Extensions.
We'll start out with an overview of extension

00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:13.759
building.
Then, we'll walk through some code and put

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.400
together an example step by step.
But before we get to the technical stuff,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.870
let's talk about what extensions are.
Google Chrome Extensions are mostly small

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.570
programs that add bits of functionality to
Google Chrome.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.779
They install instantly without a browser restart.
And, like Google Chrome, they update silently

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.329
when new versions are available.
We designed the extension system with web

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.810
developers in mind.
If you can create webpages, you know pretty

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.160
much all you need to know to create Google
Chrome extensions.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.100
In fact, extensions are implemented with nothing
but standard web technologies -- HTML, CSS,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.530
JavaScript, and so on.
An extension is a compressed directory -- a

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.830
signed zip, to be exact -- with a bunch of
web files in it.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.620
The one file every extension has to have is
a manifest file.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.110
It's also the one file that has to have a
particular name, which is "manifest.json".

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.350
As the name implies, the manifest file is
JSON-formatted data -- specifically, metadata

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.140
that describes the extension, lists permissions,
and points to the extension's other components.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.550
Those components are what give the extension
its functionality.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.060
An extension includes one or more of the following
components.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.990
Browser actions and page actions are the two
UI surfaces the extension system ships with

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.280
initially.
A browser action appears in the toolbar of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.820
every tab.
A page action selectively appears in the omnibox

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.500
and can be toggled on or off for each tab.
An extension can only have one UI surface

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.590
or the other.
We'd like to encourage extension developers

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
to be as minimal in their design decisions
as the Google Chrome team is.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.560
Content scripts are arbitrary CSS and JavaScript
that are injected into selected pages.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.050
They're similar to user scripts and can be
used as a UI alternative to browser and page

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.610
actions.
Background pages are long-running scripts

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.040
that help you manage state and coordinate
tasks across extension components.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.970
As an extension gets more complex, it tends
to need a background page.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.280
In addition to these components that are specific
to Google Chrome Extensions, you can bundle

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.550
any other web files with your extension -- images,
JavaScript libraries, Flash movies, whatever

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.370
it is your extension needs.
The extension API is small and easy to learn.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.209
It currently defines about 40 objects and
40 methods.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.269
"chrome" is the name of the top-level object
automatically exposed to all extensions.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.779
The API is split into six modules, which are
represented by objects contained in the "chrome"

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:32.659
object.
"chrome.extension" has properties and methods

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.329
that let you send messages to communicate
between extension components and resolve the

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.969
URLs of extension files.
"chrome.browserAction" lets you set the appearance

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.769
of browser actions and their badges, which
are mini text areas overlaid on browser actions.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.269
"chrome.pageAction" lets you enable and disable
page actions.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.359
"chrome.windows" lets you open, close, look
up, and update browser windows.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.189
It requires "tabs" permission in your manifest
file.

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.450
That's not a typo -- windows and tabs are
so closely related they share a common permission.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.389
"chrome.tabs" lets you perform the same actions
on tabs.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.569
It also requires "tabs" permission.
And "chrome.bookmarks" lets you read from

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.870
and write to the user's bookmark tree and
requires "bookmarks" permission.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.859
Now, let's try this stuff out by iteratively
developing an extension.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.919
Our extension will be a Google Chrome Twitter
client, which we'll call Chritter.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.340
First, we'll give the extension a basic, “hello
world”-type UI.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.659
Of course, we need a manifest file.
In it, we specify the extension's name, version

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:35.760
number, description, and icon.
For the UI part, we're going to pick a browser

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.849
action because, well, we want our tweets handy
at all times!

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.980
We populate the browser-action fields with
an icon that will appear in the toolbar, a

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.989
tooltip that will appear when the user mouses
over the icon, and a popup bubble that will

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.299
appear when the user clicks on the icon.
For now, the popup is a trivial HTML file.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:59.299
After installing our extension, we get -- as
advertised -- an icon, a tooltip, and a popup.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.299
The popup asks: "Wouldn't it be nice to see
some tweets here?"

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.760
And I think it would be nice, so let's add
some!

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.329
We'll do so by fetching Twitter's public timeline
with XMLHttpRequest.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.139
Back in our manifest file, we ask for permission
to make cross-origin requests to twitter.com

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.400
so we can access Twitter's API.
We ask for "tabs" permission, as well, so

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.949
we can open UI links in new tabs.
And in our popup file, we beef up the HTML

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:28.330
by inserting a title and a template to present
the attributes of each tweet -- a link to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.650
the user's profile, their image and name,
and the tweet itself.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.699
We also have new JavaScript for retrieving
and displaying the timeline.

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.530
When the load event fires, we run an "init"
function to grab references to the different

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.930
template elements via XPath.
That function hands control over to another

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.090
function to do the XHR work.
"getTweets" issues a simple request for a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.770
JSON feed, and in turn, hands control over
to the callback function "processTweets".

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.180
The processing function deserializes the incoming
JSON using V8's builtin JSON support and stores

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.159
the result in an array.
Iterating through the array of tweets, the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.729
"update" function assigns each template attribute
and appends the marked-up tweet to the popup.

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.430
Our extension has a lot more going on now,
with a polished UI and the most recent public

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.220
tweets to show off.
Our implementation isn't ideal, though.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.840
As a last step, let's improve the extension's
performance and functionality by refactoring

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.599
our code.
Namely, we should turn our popup into a dumb

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.169
view so it only knows how to update its display
and offload the rest of the work to a background

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.220
page.
We'll go ahead and add a background page to

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.900
our manifest.
Then, we can strip the XHR code out of our

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.150
popup.
In place of that code, we throw in a reference

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.180
to the background page, which is returned
by the "getBackgroundPage" method.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.180
The popup doesn't collect tweets anymore,
so we use the background reference to iterate

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.139
through the available tweets instead.
We move the XHR code to its new digs in the

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.120
background page, but not without a couple
upgrades.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.650
I mentioned we could improve performance and
functionality and here's where we will.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.650
Since the background page isn't tied to any
DOM event, the page can fetch tweets on a

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.460
continuous loop.
That way, we can batch tweets up and have

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.539
them ready before the user even invokes the
popup.

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.599
We specify a frequency for fetching -- 10
seconds for demo purposes -- and manage the

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.139
process with the "setInterval" method.
While we're at it, we can also spiff up the

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.370
UI.
We now have a variable number of batched tweets,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.960
which is a perfect candidate for display with
a browser-action badge.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.389
We style the badge with "setBadgeBackgroundColor"
and pass in the number of unread tweets with

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.020
"setBadgeText".
Our extension doesn't look a whole lot different

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.590
right away.
But if we let it think for a bit, we see a

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.659
badge that dynamically updates the tweet count.
The popup should work identically, although

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.210
we potentially have a lot more tweets to scroll
through now.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.550
While this version of Chritter makes for a
nice toy, there are some features we'd want

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.270
to add for it to be truly useful.
On the top of that list would be incorporating

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.991
the user's friend timeline -- rather than
the public timeline -- which would require

00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:59.949
baking OAuth into the extension.
Things can get a little hairy there.

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:03.240
Luckily, we've already done the heavy lifting
for you and have an example of Chritter with

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.660
OAuth support.
We also have a further example that handles

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.849
custom autoupdating.
To download that code, the code you just saw,

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:17.139
and more, go to code.google.com/chrome/extensions.
Thanks for watching and have fun building

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:18.330
Google Chrome Extensions!
