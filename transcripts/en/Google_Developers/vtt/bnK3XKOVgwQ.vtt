ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Welcome to the
Google Chrome Developers'

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.330
WebGL Hangout.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.460
And today, we've got a bunch
of people from the Web GL

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.600
community who are
participating.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.700
A bunch of people from the 3JS
side, and we've got Brendan

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.360
Kenny, who's on the Google
Maps GL Team,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.998
Brandon Jones from the--

00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:32.130
well, he's done some cool
demos, tojico.com.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.610
So if you guys would like to
give us a nice, small self

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.860
introduction.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.530
I'll start.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.360
OK, so I'm Ilmari Heikkinen,
and I work on the Google

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.160
Chrome Developer Relations
team here at London.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.830
And basically, I do demos,
articles, talks, stuff, and

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.490
run hangouts like this.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.180
So please?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.440
PAUL LEWIS: I'll go next.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.870
I'm Paul Lewis.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.250
Some people know me from
aerotwist.com, I spent most of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.620
my days as a web developer.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.620
But outside of that, I do web
GL demos and kind of make

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.190
myself useful in that way,
writing tutorials and that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.440
kind of thing.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.910
JEROME ETIENNE: OK,
so I go next.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.460
Hello, Ricardo.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.950
So I've been doing
some tutorials on

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.710
learningthreejs.com, and some
nice demo and [? currently ?]

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.585
I'm writing J Query.

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.390
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: All
right, so that

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.640
person was Jerome Etienne.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.814
I think he missed that.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:50.308
JEROME ETIENNE: Sorry.

00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:51.558
Yes.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.090
ILMARI HEIKKINEN:
Can't hear you.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.210
BRENDAN KENNY: There we go.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.010
Hi, I'm Brendan Kenny.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.390
As Ilmari said, I work
on the Maps Developer

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.710
Relations Team at Google.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.670
So like him, I write demos
and code samples and help

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.070
developers make good maps.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.370
And we're kind of gearing up
right now, actually, with some

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.110
really exciting WebGL data
visualization stuff that we

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.260
started talking about last week
at Strata and this week

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.140
at South by Southwest
in a couple weeks.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.790
Which is great, because WebGL is
very close to my heart, and

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.940
any excuse I have to make it as
much of my job as possible

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.190
is very welcome.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.530
BRANDON JONES: I'm Brandon
Jones, and I'm a HTML5

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.360
developer for Motorola, Web GL
hobbyist, it doesn't actually

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.120
have too much to do with my
real job, unfortunately.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.760
But I just like to put several
demos online, author of the GL

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.400
Matrix Library, and just
generally enjoy working with

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.221
and promoting WebGL
wherever I can.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.070
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: And we have
Ricardo joining us as well.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.550
RICARDO CABELLO: Hello.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.160
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Can you give
us a short introduction?

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.860
RICARDO CABELLO: Sure.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.070
Can you hear me?

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.770
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Yes.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.490
RICARDO CABELLO: Cool.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.800
So I'm Ricard Cabello, or
Cabe-ye-lo, and I started a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.880
library for doing
3D in JavaScript

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.530
about two years ago.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.870
Originally, it was for cameras,
and now we have a

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.800
WebGL renderer and we have
some samples with that.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.944
And I mainly work on that
library nowadays.

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:45.230
PAUL LEWIS: I think
I've heard of it.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.630
Complete mystery [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.736
RICARDO CABELLO: Yeah, I keep
trying to do nice things so

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:51.986
you can see it.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.250
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: That is
Ricardo Cabello, or Mr. Doob,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.330
from the 3JS fame.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.770
RICARDO CABELLO: I didn't
mention the name?

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.510
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: No.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.830
RICARDO CABELLO: Well, you just
you get an idea how good

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.080
I am at those things.

00:04:18.012 --> 00:04:22.830
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: OK, so the
agenda today is, well, we've

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.290
got a lot of 3JS people here, so
let's talk about 3JS, let's

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.970
talk about WebGL, what works,
what doesn't, how to get

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.640
started, that kind of thing.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.228
If you're working on anything
cool that you can share, it

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:40.600
might be fun to hear about it.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.286
So thank you all
for joining us.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:48.536
This is great.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.455
RICARDO CABELLO: Is there a way
to know how many people

00:04:54.455 --> 00:04:57.332
are watching this?

00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:59.710
ILMARI HEIKKINEN:
I have no idea.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.260
I don't think so.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.780
We can see a recorded
views on YouTube.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.210
PETE: Hey guys, I'm Pete.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.810
I'm one of the developer
advocates working on the

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.810
Chrome Team with Ilmari and a
bunch of these other guys.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.070
Let me actually ask a first
question from one of the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.690
things that I've seen a
bunch of people ask.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.950
What's the best way for
folks to get started

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.296
with the 3JS libraries?

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.120
RICARDO CABELLO: I think
Jerome can answer that.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.500
JEROME ETIENNE: Well, OK.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.430
So there's a bunch of tutorials

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.160
available on the network.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.670
I'm awfully be sorry,
I'm bad with names.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.140
So probably with
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.704
which is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:05:55.682 --> 00:06:00.510
And it's called Get Started,
if I remember well?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.840
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, getting
started with 3JS.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.460
Definitely.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.590
Yeah, that's what it's called.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.215
Sort of does what it says on
the tin, that one, really.

00:06:07.215 --> 00:06:09.150
JEROME ETIENNE: So it's under
[? Read Me ?] and I think you

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.720
know HTML5 rocks, too.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.505
And personally, I do learning
through GS blog which is a

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:19.170
bunch of tutorial on that.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.670
If you want to learn
learnings 3JS.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.890
Obviously, readings and tutorial
is a good part of it.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.800
After that, you can come and
join the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.500
channel to get some
help, live help.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.790
You can [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.060
or in fact, the meat of 3JS
is inside the example.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.020
There is something like Ricardo
maybe can correct me,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.750
but a huge bunch of them
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:06:47.922 --> 00:06:51.470
RICARDO CABELLO: 1,000.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.680
JEROME ETIENNE: 1,000.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.930
I hope not for you.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.620
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.530
a good bunch of them, showing
the values possibility.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.330
You read the code, and after
that, you get how it works.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.260
It's not that hard.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.020
Essentially, it's pretty easy,
I believe, at least.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.670
RICARDO CABELLO: I think it's
always the best way just to

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.590
play with examples and choose
some values, until you start

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.600
to get an idea more or less
how the API works.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.260
And these days, I am working on
the documentation finally,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.620
so that will hopefully make
things easier for people that

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.870
don't think like me.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.860
BRANDON JONES: If I could just
add something to that.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.990
I think at the last WebGL camp
that we did at Mozilla, Henric

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.120
mentioned that anything that
we're doing with WebGL is

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.730
effectively open source by
default, because you can go to

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.870
any of the sample pages and hit
Control U, whatever it is

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.780
in your browser of choice,
and pull up the

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.140
source right there.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.100
And I think I've yet to see a
3JS demo that was actually

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.470
obfuscated in any way.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.850
So if you see something that you
like online, pull up the

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.330
source and start looking
through it.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.180
I've found that that's, in many
cases, the best way to

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.120
learn, once you've gotten
over that initial

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.370
getting started period.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.610
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: I also have
some basics of 3JS slide tech

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.210
up with a bunch of examples.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.970
So that might be one way to get
started as well, if you

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.070
just want to--

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.140
PETE: Where can folks
find those?

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:47.810
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Sorry?

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.070
PETE: Where can people
find those if they

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.430
want to look for them?

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.120
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: OK, so
the 3JS home page--

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.540
actually the 3JS wiki has links
for getting started.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:07.860
I think it's
github.com/mrdoob/three.js and

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.450
click on the wiki-link there.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.390
PETE: And your slides?

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.240
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: My
slides would be at

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:22.580
fhtr.org/basicsof3js with
strange capital--

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.890
PETE: Yes, it sounds
like a great URL.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.750
What we'll do is we'll add the
links that get mentioned in

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.050
the video, as well as in the
comments for the video

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.345
afterwards.

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:38.430
So if you miss any of these
links, don't worry

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.680
about that too much.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.990
BRANDON JONES: If we put
something into the group chat,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.296
will it show up for anybody
who's viewing the broadcast?

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:49.890
PETE: No, sadly, it won't.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.390
RICARDO CABELLO: I wonder if
it's better just for people

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.490
that want to start to go to
learning WebGL just so they

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.780
see what the complexity of the
things are before going to a

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.680
framework or a library.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.990
I don't know what's better, if
it's better to go to a library

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.040
first, and then understand
what's going

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.800
on, or I don't know.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.480
PAUL LEWIS: I mean, that's
kind of how I started.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.910
I started out with 3JS.

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.280
And as I got kind of comfortable
with that, I then

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.940
hit a slight frustration wall
where I was like, OK, but how

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.030
is this actually doing all
this magic on screen?

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.690
So for me, I mean, not
necessarily the same for

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.390
everybody, but I think my
experience was definitely that

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.910
if I went straight to the
WebGL, I found it

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.570
overwhelming, I think.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.530
Having it abstracted away so I
could learn the basic concepts

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.060
was helpful first, like
[INAUDIBLE] geometry, all

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.980
those things.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.340
And then after that, I started
to try and understand what was

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.340
going on underneath it.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.120
But I can see the other way
around as well, and I think a

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.320
lot of people would say
it works for them

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.600
the other way around.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.430
But certainly, in my case, I
found it easier to start with

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.070
the library first and then
understand what it was doing

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.612
once I understood
those basics.

00:11:05.612 --> 00:11:08.800
PETE: Did anybody else go
the other way around?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.250
BRANDON JONES: I went the other
way around, but I think

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.990
I was a bit of a special case in
that I'd been working with

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.140
3D APIs direct to 3D and OpenGL
on the desktop for a

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.190
while, just as hobby.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.160
And so jumping into WebGL
initially was a fairly natural

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.930
transition, because
it really is just

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.710
OpenGL ES 2 on the web.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.380
And so if you've got that kind
of background, it's probably

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.310
going to be more natural and
easier just to jump into using

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.620
the API directly.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.790
But if you're not familiar with
that, I mean, it's an API

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.340
that's evolved over
a good long time,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.660
and it's fairly complex.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.180
There's a lot of moving parts.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.170
And it takes a lot of
boilerplate code just to get

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.440
that initial polygon on screen,
during which you're

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.690
pulling your hair out going,
why can't I see anything?

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:05.510
As such, I'm always in favor
of people learning what's

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.570
going on behind the scenes.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.380
But I really do think for
something like this, starting

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.320
out with a framework is maybe
the path of least frustration.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.750
That said, I do wish that there
was a little bit more in

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:24.840
the way of a bridge between your
3JSes and the raw WebGL.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.220
To say, all right, well if
you're doing this in the

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.210
framework, here's how you
transition into the real world

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.460
when you want to do something
that's not nicely encapsulated

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.202
by a library, because
everybody's going to hit that

00:12:37.202 --> 00:12:39.062
at some point.

00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:40.312
JEROME ETIENNE: Yeah, but
it's always [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.190
My opinion, at least, is what
bigger [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.600
of 3JS or [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.830
is you don't need to
understand all

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.770
the mathematics behind.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.570
BRANDON JONES: Which is a huge
plus at the very beginning

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.320
when you're starting to learn,
because that's very

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.310
complicated stuff.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.135
JEROME ETIENNE: People like it
because [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:02.135 --> 00:13:06.290
and stuff like that, or they
don't want to do that.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.920
So at least my personal opinion,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] take

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.060
advantage of libraries, because
they hide all of these

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.870
problems.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.080
BRANDON JONES: I completely
agree.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.640
PAUL LEWIS: I think that's
a really good point.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.450
But I think, Brandon, I think
you touched on this awhile ago

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:26.210
in one of your blog posts about
one of the reasons that

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.640
you do the raw WebGL is as much
as anything, sometimes

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.400
you can really target exactly
what you want to do.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.780
And the best one in the world
any engine is trying to give

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.970
you a fairly generic viewing.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.250
They'll let you do a number of
tasks, and you might need to

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.300
just go straight in and
do one specific thing.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.820
And in that case, it
might not be as

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.950
suitable to use the library.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.580
It may actually be more suitable
to just try and

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.560
pinpoint that one little thing
that you're trying to do.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.280
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.905
like?

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.790
Since I see a bunch of
tutorials that are--

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:06.570
on one hand, there's 3JS,
getting started with 3JS,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.160
getting started with
libraries.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.490
And then there's this sort of
low level WebGL, the very

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.130
basics, and getting
up from there.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:23.530
So I guess the bridge would be
something that's sort of like

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:30.360
making your own 3D library,
or something like that.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.340
BRANDON JONES: I would have a
really hard time recommending

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.450
that to anybody, honestly.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.700
JEROME ETIENNE: [INAUDIBLE]
can do it.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.850
BRANDON JONES: It would
certainly be an educational

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:49.440
experience for people, but
yeah, I don't know.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.000
Doing your own library--

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.260
BRENDAN KENNY: Well it depends
on, are you trying to get

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.730
something done, or you
just trying to make

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.930
something and learn?

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:58.080
I think Paul would be the best
person to ask about how

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:01.192
effective that is at learning.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:08.730
PAUL LEWIS: Yeah, so my way of
learning WebGL after spending

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.640
some time with 3JS was to
try and write my own.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.890
And Brendan was actually
exceedingly helpful during

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.450
that process as I was sort of
scratching my head and pulling

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:24.120
my hair out for sort of, how
do you use matrices.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.040
All those kinds of things that
had been abstracted away, and

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.540
I couldn't remember from
my time at school.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.330
Would I use my own engine
in production?

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.180
I put my hand on my heart and
say no, I'd use 3JS if I was

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.270
in a production setting, because
I think it's a lot

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.700
more mature as a library.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.380
In terms of learning, I
learned tons doing it.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.880
I learned what not to do.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.280
There are still tons of things
that I'm still learning that I

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.390
should have done better.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.200
But I think in terms of starting
from absolutely no

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.980
understanding to understanding
OK, these are the components,

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.960
these are the bits that go in,
yeah, I'm glad I tried to

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.160
write one, certainly.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.276
So it's valid from a learning
standpoint, for sure.

00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:08.130
But as Brendan said, if you're
trying to get something done,

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.790
you might want to use something
that's already

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.292
mature and out there
and working.

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:14.290
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, it won't
be an efficient process.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.710
You'll be spending a lot of time
wondering why nothing is

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:18.370
on the screen.

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.390
PETE: So actually, there's a
question on the moderator

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.950
right now that I think this
segues really nicely into.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:28.030
The question is, what are some
of the most popular, efficient

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.835
tools and libraries for people
to use with WebGL?

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:39.515
BRANDON JONES: Define
efficiency.

00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:42.385
I mean, are you talking about
efficiency of rendering?

00:16:42.385 --> 00:16:45.320
Are you talking about efficiency
of how fast it is

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.940
to get something up on screen?

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.810
There's several different ways
you could take that.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.740
PETE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.410
I'll leave that up to your
imagination as the questioner

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:55.290
did for us.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.820
So however you want
to answer that.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:03.700
JEROME ETIENNE: Go
ahead, guys.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.109
RICARDO CABELLO: Isn't there
like a wiki page with all the

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.010
list of WebGL--

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.680
I think it's on Chome's website,
there is a list of

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.750
all the frameworks
and libraries for

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.000
people to play with?

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:18.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.140
BRANDON JONES: I think
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] has something

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.390
similar, too.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.640
JEROME ETIENNE: Maybe we can
decompose that and see, for

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.620
example, if efficiency is
development time, if

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:36.255
efficiency is running speed,
or I don't know.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:39.775
We can list by assumption.

00:17:39.775 --> 00:17:45.440
BRENDAN KENNY: I haven't used
all of the WebGL framework, so

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.300
I haven't used, say, SceneJS
or things like that.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.550
But I'm a big fan of--

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.690
I know Brandon was talking
earlier about the transition

00:17:52.690 --> 00:18:01.480
between 3JS and then kind
of more pure WebGL.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.560
I'm a big fan of PhiloGL or
Phy-lo GL, depending on how

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.860
you pronounce your
Greek letters.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.765
And also, this one doesn't get
talked about much, but Evan

00:18:10.765 --> 00:18:15.350
Wallace has made some really
amazing WebGL demos.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.850
He's the guy that made the ball
that's floating in water,

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.200
and it does real time refraction
and everything,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.350
path tracing.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.540
Anyway, he has a really
lightweight WebGL library on

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.980
his GitHub account, on
his GitHub page.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.330
And I don't know if he ever
advertises it, but you can go

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.070
and fork it and use it.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.240
So I'm a big fan of those, but
only if you want to get as

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.690
close to WebGL as possible
with taking some of the

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.570
boilerplate out of the mix.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:45.920
RICARDO CABELLO: Have
you tried the TDL

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.910
one from Greg Taveres?

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:49.560
BRENDAN KENNY: That's
a good point.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.150
That's another one.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.670
I haven't used that
in awhile, though.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.100
I don't know if he--

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.680
RICARDO CABELLO: But
do you know how he

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.730
compares to the Evan one?

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.610
BRENDAN KENNY: Oh, it's
pretty similar.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.630
Greg is like a graphics
programmer, longtime graphics

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.790
programmer, so it's
definitely--

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.540
and he comes from like
a C, C++ background.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.110
And I think that's he was
writing it while he was still

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.010
kind of getting to
know JavaScript.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.760
So it's not as naturally
JavaScript, but it's

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.230
definitely in terms of
efficiency, it's definitely

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.750
there, because that's why he
wrote it was to get things on

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:27.130
the screen with no
cruft in between.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:35.630
So yeah, definitely a fan of
picking code from Greg's code

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.500
anytime I want to just
get something done.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.280
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Brandon,
you've done like the Quake 3

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.450
demo, and the JS2 demo, and the
Rage demo, and they all

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.440
seem to be something that would
actually use quite a bit

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.820
of horsepower and require
a lot of performance.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.590
So do you have any tips
and tricks on that?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.030
BRANDON JONES: Oh goodness.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.750
I'm very fond of saying that
anything you would have done

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.860
in the desktop still applies
here, for the most part.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.030
But I'm learning more
and more that--

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.120
and I think this is great, by
the way, that we've got a

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.800
large community of people who
are coming into WebGL as

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.040
experienced web developers,
but not necessarily

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.500
experienced 3D developers
for the desktop.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:30.210
So I think that advice maybe
falls a little flat.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.840
But some of the just really
general tips-- and I've seen

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:40.200
that many of the frameworks
allow these optimizations in

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.510
some way, shape or form--

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.970
is primarily, you just want to
group as many similar draw

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:49.290
calls together as you can.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.400
So if you've got a whole bunch
of geometry that uses the same

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.410
texture, the same material,
whatever the case may be, you

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.820
want to try to, as much as
possible, render those in a

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.530
single draw call.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.590
I know, for example, like 3JS--
and I don't know the

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.100
right terminology
for this, maybe

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.700
Ricardo can help me out--

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.160
allows you to actually
batch up geometry

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.410
into a single buffer.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.280
RICARDO CABELLO: Managing
geometry in just a single

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.620
geometry, yeah.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.290
BRANDON JONES: Yeah,
thank you.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.830
That's what it is.

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.810
You want to try to
do that kind of

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.120
thing as much as possible.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:30.280
So just as a high level bit of
real world advice, so for the

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.400
Quake 3 and the TF2 demos,
what I tend to do is do a

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.170
pre-process over the
level, just sort

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.290
everything by material.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.790
And then if I'm doing any
visibility culling, it tends

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.650
to be on the material level, not
the geometry block level.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.710
And my render loop is basically
just a loop over

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.390
every material in the scene,
and then I render every

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.100
triangle that uses that material
to switch state as

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.360
little as possible.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.950
And this tends to be a very
effective way of rendering a

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.850
lot of polygons very quickly.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.810
But it does take a lot
of pre-sorting and

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.160
pre-calculating to begin with.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.550
So it's not necessarily an
easy process, but it's a

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.920
worthwhile one if you're
really going for high

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.170
performance.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.765
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Thanks.

00:22:20.765 --> 00:22:22.015
That's awesome.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:29.290
OK, so I'm going to go through
my spiel a bit.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.880
So this is the Google Chrome
Developers WebGL hangout.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.790
And here we have a list of
guests from the WebGL world.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:45.050
Starting from the left, Brandon
Jones from tojico.com

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.920
Then we have Brendan Kenny, from
the Google Maps Developer

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.762
Relations Team.

00:22:50.762 --> 00:22:54.950
Me, Ilmari Heikknen, from the
Google Chrome Developer

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.420
Relations Team.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.175
Then we've got Jerome Etienne,
from learning3js.com.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:07.770
Paul Lewis from aerotwist.com,
and Ricardo

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.370
Cabello of 3JS fame.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.960
And we are talking about
WebGL and 3JS.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.360
ILMARI HEIKKINEN:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.770
Greetings, we have a new guest.
Any questions thus far?

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.940
RICARDO CABELLO: I
think he's mute.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.160
MICHAEL ENSMINGER: Now
can you hear me?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:41.435
Wow.

00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:42.150
Hi.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.130
No, I just joined.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.990
I just want to agree on what
Brandon just said, that

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:54.465
keeping draw calls down
is a big one.

00:23:54.465 --> 00:23:57.560
I'm sitting with a WebGL
project right now,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:05.360
prototyping, and we saw some
great performance increase

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.060
when we did just that.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:14.570
We just brought down like 2,000
draw calls into one, it

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:20.050
was this huge performance
increase, which was great.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:24.870
ILMARI HEIKKINEN:
Cool, thanks.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.330
PETE: I have a question
for Brendan.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.400
Brendan, I know that the Maps
Team is doing some stuff

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.890
around WebGL.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:34.230
Can you talk about that
just a little bit?

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:35.900
BRENDAN KENNY: Oh, yeah.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:44.170
So we've been kind of on
a kick lately to get--

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.100
let's see.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.140
Thinking about how to visualize
large data sets,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.410
especially geographic data sets,
but in our case just

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:59.840
large data sets, kind looking at
beyond 3D or I guess games

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.860
applications of WebGL.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.220
I'm a gamer at heart, but it's
interesting to look at what

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.530
experiences WebGL enables that
didn't exist before,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.250
or even a year ago.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:20.025
So we've been looking at kind
of what can we do to kind of

00:25:20.025 --> 00:25:22.840
take a glimpse into large data
sets and see the kind of

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.820
patterns that are there.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.460
And we have a presentation,
but I don't know

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.480
how to link it up.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.250
But we've been starting to
present some things with my

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.620
colleague Chris Broadfoot,
just presented a

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.290
really great data set.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.040
It's like 1 million GPS
coordinates from cabs in San

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.020
Francisco from one night
in San Francisco.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.870
And so he visualized
it in real time.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.300
You can kind of see where all
the cabs are, but then you can

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.720
kind of also spread it out
through time, so you can start

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.590
seeing, where are the slow parts
of the city, where are

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.300
cabs just kind of hanging
out during the night?

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.700
Or even like we started looking
at some really cool

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.010
stuff of kind of the spread
of the GPS points.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.200
Because you can see in downtown
San Francisco,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.590
there's not good GPS reception
because of the tall buildings.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.430
And so you see the GPS becomes
kind of a fog instead of nice

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.425
paths on the road.

00:26:16.425 --> 00:26:19.380
Once you can actually see it
on screen, you can start

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.240
getting ideas for teasing out
patterns and data that you

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.690
wouldn't actually be able
to do if you just

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.690
saw it in a CSV file.

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.190
Anyway, so yeah, we've been
working on kind of good ways

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.140
of doing that, and then starting
to advocate to

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.960
developers just now.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.290
We're going to continue, there's
a South by Southwest

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.530
session sometime very
soon, I'm not sure.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.980
Yeah, so that's kind of
what we're up to.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.500
RICARDO CABELLO: Isn't it next
week, South by Southwest?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.512
BRANDON JONES: It could
be, I don't know.

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:56.330
PETE: I think it starts
this weekend.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.015
BRANDON JONES: I think the
interactive starts this

00:26:58.015 --> 00:27:00.780
weekend, and maybe music is
next week or something.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.990
PETE: So there's another
question from the moderator

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:08.630
that I want to just pop up.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:11.430
And the question was,
do you think that--

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.070
and it's OK not to know the
answer to this-- but do you

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.380
think that Dart will have some
WebGL functions directly

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.630
included in it?

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.320
BRANDON JONES: So I was actually
playing around with

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.170
WebGL in Dart maybe a week
ago, and just doing some

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.810
initial pokings at that.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.560
It is supported right now.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.840
You access it through
their DOM API.

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.680
So it's very much just a
direct exposure of the

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.170
underlying WebGL API.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.700
There's not anything really too
terribly special about it

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.860
to help you out, at
least not yet.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.390
I don't know what their
plans are for it,

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.330
going in the future.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.460
And I must say that it's a
little annoying to work with,

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.470
because any of your
enumerations, you end up

00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.320
having to type out the full
WebGL object name every time.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:05.330
It's like
WebGLRenderContext.Blend,

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.180
which is a little annoying.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.380
But it works.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.430
It works quite well.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.180
I found it to be fairly
performant.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.380
And yeah, it's just it's very
low-level at this point.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:20.480
That's about the only thing
I have to say against it.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.080
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, I think
it's hard with WebGL being so

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.520
young to really commit to an
abstraction that maybe Dart

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.440
would like, and then know in
like a year or two that it

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.740
would have been a
good decision.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.075
So it seems like it's better to
leave it at low-level, and

00:28:35.075 --> 00:28:37.160
then maybe rely on authors
to make something

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.060
like a 3JS in Dart.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.130
Theoretically in time, it might
be nice, the kind of

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:49.690
tight checking and other
benefits of Dart might be a

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:51.630
good thing there.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.270
On the other hand, WebGL code is
already very typed, because

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.820
you have to have typed arrays,
and that sort of thing.

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.800
It seems like it would be a bit
of a wash, like it's very

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.050
much there if you're
using Dart.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.870
But I don't know if there are
any great advantages that Dart

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.120
brings there.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.400
BRANDON JONES: I didn't
find it to be any

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:21.080
better or worse, really.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.330
It's just WebGL.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.520
PETE: Cool.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.030
Well, there's another
question in here.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.220
With WebGL coming to mobile
platforms, what kind of new

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.170
applications will this enable,
and will performance be good

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.040
enough to compete with
native applications?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.290
This is from Jeff.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.380
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Well, WebGL
performance is basically

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:53.780
JavaScript performance plus the
bindings of the open GLES

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.240
2.0 driver's performance.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.210
So if the mobile JavaScript
performance is there, then you

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:06.120
should be able to do stuff that
you can do on mobile in

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.100
native code, graphics-wise.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.180
Well, that's my hunch
at least.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.950
PAUL LEWIS: There was that Opera
demo a week or so ago,

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.530
right, that was running 60,
70 frames a second?

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.470
And it was the Opera, the guy
walking on the platform

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.865
looking really mean
and grumpy.

00:30:27.865 --> 00:30:29.490
You know the one?

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:37.940
JEROME ETIENNE: It was 72 FPS
with 37,000 polygons, and it

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.190
was on Opera Mobile.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.230
But well, this was a demo.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.770
The main difference that
I have seen on

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.910
mobile is two things.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.870
First, it's [? VPU ?]

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.490
doesn't have the same
characteristic.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.045
So what we are used to
on desktop, mobile

00:30:57.045 --> 00:30:57.830
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:02.050
bottleneck [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
almost the same.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.200
Another part which for 3JS is
important, the JavaScript is

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.780
much lower.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:13.960
So all 3JS is going to have to
make progress, let's say.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.400
BRANDON JONES: So just to throw
this out, I actually had

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:24.787
a coworker of mine show me the
new Opera 12 running on, I

00:31:24.787 --> 00:31:26.080
think it was an Atrix 2.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.880
And we pulled up my Quake 3
demo, and we were able to get

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.000
it running on there at about
26 frames per second, which

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.950
was pretty good, overall.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:46.890
Now as a disclaimer on that one,
I've got the Quake 3 demo

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.360
set so that when you run it on
mobile now, it will actually

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.990
render at a quarter of the
screen size and then upscale

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:57.830
it through CSS, so it's
not utilizing every

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:59.110
pixel on the screen.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.220
But generally, it still gives
acceptable results, and we

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.130
were getting pretty close
to 30 frames per

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.250
second on that device.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.950
I also tried it on, I think, an
older model Samsung Galaxy

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.580
tab, and unfortunately,
I was getting

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.120
maybe 12 or so on that.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.860
But it was also rendering a
much larger screen area.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.490
But I must say that overall, I
was actually very impressed at

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.300
how well Opera was able
to handle it.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.710
I've done some similar
experiments in Firefox in the

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.550
past, unfortunately haven't done
those recently, but it's

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.250
always seemed to do decently.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.560
And I'm looking forward to when
they finally flip the

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.780
switch on WebGL for Chrome
on mobile, to see

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:40.620
where that is, too.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.420
But it's definitely much lower
than you would ever get on the

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.900
desktop, but performs better
than expected, I'd say.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.460
BRENDAN KENNY: Yeah, you
shouldn't feel bad about

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.530
shrinking the back buffer,
because that's common on

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.610
native apps, too.

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:59.710
So they can't complain.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:04.090
I'm really excited about
the mobile WebGL stuff.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.410
I think not only does it let
us make kind of this new

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.100
content, so that's exciting
in and of itself,

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:11.690
having it on mobile.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:17.150
But I think in terms of the
mobile platform itself, it'll

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.890
enable kind of experiences that
we haven't been able to

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.160
make before, and it will be in
your pocket, just like a

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.680
native app.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.530
There are very different
performance characteristics.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.420
You definitely have to think
about the JavaScript execution

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.900
and think about how much can
you kind of pre-compute and

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.160
pre-transform, or pre- whatever
on the server side

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.320
beforehand, so that when it
comes down to JavaScript,

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:47.035
you're not spending a lot of
time decompressing a mesh or

00:33:47.035 --> 00:33:51.440
doing some fancy thing, where
it will take 10 seconds and

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.820
maybe it'll block the
main thread as it

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.920
uploads to the GPU.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.760
Generally, the vertex shaders
on phones are less powerful.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.760
But they do have an advantage of
a lot of them use this kind

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:09.639
of tiled deferred rendering
behind the scenes, which lets

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.920
you save a lot on the
fragment shaders.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.280
It won't actually run the
fragment shaders until the

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.070
very end, so you don't get
a lot of overdraws.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.189
Sometimes you can do fancier
effects than you

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:20.189
think, which is nice.

00:34:23.284 --> 00:34:26.610
I had something else, but
I can't remember it now.

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.179
RICARDO CABELLO: There
was something I

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.370
was trying last week.

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:32.880
I don't know if we can see it
with the Opera browser for

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.679
mobile, but they also allow
access to the webcam.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.929
I don't know if this
works at all.

00:34:40.695 --> 00:34:42.232
PETE: There you go, if
you pull it back

00:34:42.232 --> 00:34:44.760
just a little bit?

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.870
RICARDO CABELLO: Can you see?

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.280
Oh, this is my finger.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.305
Sorry.

00:34:48.305 --> 00:34:50.480
Try it again.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.230
It's an example from--

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.370
I never know how to pronounce
his name.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.680
I think it's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:03.610
And he has this webcam toy that
basically, with Opera,

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.350
you can access to the webcam
from the website, and then

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.130
apply filters using
WebGL and GLSL.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.930
So this guy has like
a ton of effects.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:16.240
It's like you can start to get
an idea of kind of augmented

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.365
reality, whenever something that
actually makes sense to

00:35:18.365 --> 00:35:18.680
do with that.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.660
But basically, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:26.510
But now, you have access from
the browser to play with that.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.840
Let's see if I can make
it work again.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.960
JEROME ETIENNE: Ricardo,
did you try augmented

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.570
reality on the phone?

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.890
RICARDO CABELLO: No, no.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.533
I guess this is just--

00:35:40.533 --> 00:35:43.830
I guess it's going to be quite
a little bit slow to find

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.320
targets and everything, but
let's see if I can make it--

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.200
BRENDAN KENNY: Part of the
problem is that framing on

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:55.610
those cameras can be a little
slow, and a lag as well.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.380
So maybe if somebody's trying
to find something, they've

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.980
already pointed the opposite
way by the time your

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.040
code gets to it.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.900
I remember the other thing I
was going to say was just

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:08.240
definitely check out both Apple
and Google have great

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.040
resources on the Android and
IOS development sites for

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.140
graphics in native
mobile apps.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.920
And that definitely applies if
you're interested in getting

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.300
into mobile WebGL, it's the same
exact thing, kind of the

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.720
same performance characteristics
as obviously,

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.600
once you upload your GPU,
it's all the same.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.850
But looking at how you can
make your data faster to

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.610
compute on, what can you do in
your shaders, that sort of

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:36.240
thing, to get better
mobile code.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.420
Because it is a really is a
pretty different architecture

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.260
underneath the API.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.440
But definitely check those
out if you're interested.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.680
RICARDO CABELLO: I was seeing
some people that were kind of

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.110
expecting the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.820
some of the 3.js examples, they
were expecting that the

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.320
3.js examples were going to work
on mobile, but I don't

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.900
think that's really going
to be the case.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.700
If you wanted [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.170
to mobile, we should start right
from the mobile and then

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.540
going out to the desktop, rather
than having desktop,

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:06.300
and then magically working on
the mobile or just playing in

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.520
the library, because
it's too slow.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.540
It just needs to be from the
bottom, from the slower to the

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:16.350
fastest one

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.890
PETE: So there's a question here
from Andrew in the UK.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.220
Many developers have now gained
familiarity with 2D

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.780
context of Canvas.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.020
What resources would you
recommend for transitioning to

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.270
3D with WebGL?

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.390
ILMARI HEIKKINEN:
From 2D Canvas.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:44.400
WebGL is a whole different
beast. 2D Canvas is where you

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.320
draw stuff, you draw paths,
lines, text, images.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:54.230
In WebGL, you've got textures
and buffers and shaders that

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:59.660
actually turn all that other
things into an image on your

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.940
screen, and that is
a pretty big leap.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.260
But I would go with
learningWebGL.com, which gives

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.950
you an understanding of the
very basics, and getting

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.800
started with simple things.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.840
The other thing would be 3JS
or another library that

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.660
abstracts away all the
complicated things, or rather,

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.160
the things that you don't really
actually want to do

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.410
most of the time.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.090
BRANDON JONES: I don't know
if it directly maps to the

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:38.990
question that he's asking, but
there was an interesting blog

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:44.610
post by Greg [? Cateras ?]

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.850
that's entitled, "WebGL
Fundamentals: WebGL is a 2D

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:54.760
API." And that's an interesting
read at the very

00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.800
least, in that he just goes
over basically how WebGL

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:04.860
functionality maps to
just 2D drawing.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.480
And in the end actually, it
really truly is a 2D API.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.250
It's the matrices
that make it 3D.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:15.630
So if you're familiar with a
lot of 2D concepts, that's

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.500
probably a decent article to
read through, because it does

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.955
hit on some of those concepts.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.650
JEROME ETIENNE: OK, just I don't
know if you can see, but

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:32.390
OpenGL ES Programming Guide,
just like the reference to

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.070
learn OpenGL.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.750
People may not know, but WebGL
is basically the exact same as

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:42.660
this, with JavaScript
on the side.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.890
So if you want to understand
actually WebGL, you read that

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.570
and you make a lot
of progress.

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:50.820
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.040
PETE: Are there actually any
books available today

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.800
specifically on WebGL or
anything like that, if

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.650
somebody wants to get a book
that anyone would recommend?

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:09.330
BRENDAN KENNY: Not yet.

00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:13.290
One is coming, but not for
a while, later this year.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.550
So I think right now, that
really is the book.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:18.560
BRANDON JONES: What's
the one that you're

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.930
thinking that's coming?

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:21.670
BRENDAN KENNY: Are you
talking to me?

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.160
RICARDO CABELLO: Your book.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.310
BRENDAN KENNY: It might be
yours, I'm not sure.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.170
BRANDON JONES: That's
what I'm wondering.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:28.540
BRENDAN KENNY: I'm not writing
a secret book,

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:32.110
I'm not saying that.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:34.710
PAUL LEWIS: There's a book
coming, said [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.160
JEROME ETIENNE: That's
not mine, I promise.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.560
BRANDON JONES: Yeah, I've been
coauthoring a WebGL beginner's

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.420
guide, but I really have no
idea when it's going to be

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.420
coming out.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.970
I can say that the first drafts
of all the chapters are

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.930
done, but that doesn't mean
too much in terms of

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.230
publishing dates.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.630
BRENDAN KENNY: So you're going
to finish it like next week,

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:58.010
is what you're saying?

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.540
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.800
right now, on the air.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.550
Wow.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:02.490
BRANDON JONES: No.

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:03.440
PAUL LEWIS: That's a
big commencement.

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.420
Well done, Brandon.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.150
PETE: And it is recorded
live and will be--

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.480
BRANDON JONES: No, erase
everything that I just said.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.650
JEROME ETIENNE: You're
committed.

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.900
No re-do.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.390
BRENDAN KENNY: Anyway, it will
be nice to have an actually

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.190
WebGL book.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.830
Because I know it is difficult,
talking to some

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:29.090
people that have opened up the
OpenGL ES 2 Programming Guide,

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.340
and it's like C Code.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.130
OpenGL is already rather
esoteric too.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:38.500
It's kind of legacy, 20
year plus legacy.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.790
So it will be nice to have a
book that's specifically about

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:44.220
WebGL, so you're not
simultaneously learning about

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.930
OpenGL and trying to translate
in your head

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.980
the JavaScript calls.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.170
But it maps fairly closely.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:54.150
So once you kind of are a little
more used to WebGL,

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.020
it's definitely a very
handy guide.

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.055
I keep it on my desk
for reference.

00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:04.890
RICARDO CABELLO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.175
maybe about GLSL rather
than WebGL?

00:42:08.175 --> 00:42:12.970
Like WebGL is was kind of the
connection between say

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.180
JavaScript and GLSL.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.710
They're shading language.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:19.530
And probably the shading
language is something that you

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.721
can use for doing much more
different stuff, and not the,

00:42:22.721 --> 00:42:23.650
say, boring stuff.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:27.222
It's in the middle.

00:42:27.222 --> 00:42:31.240
So I don't have the book in my
hand but there are really good

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.810
books about GLSL that you get
an idea of how the graphics

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:36.570
cards work.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.090
And what you send to the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.090
to the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.840
and you start to understand
more how

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.630
the pieces fit together.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.680
PETE: Could you just define what
GLSL is for maybe those

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.770
of us who are a little
bit naive?

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.900
RICARDO CABELLO: Wow, anyone
want to do that?

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.160
PETE: Or like the 10 second
version of it?

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.510
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: GLSL
is the Graphics

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.290
Library Shading Language.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.010
PETE: All right, there we go.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:10.800
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Now
everything's clear, right?

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.600
PETE: As mud, absolutely.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:20.420
BRENDAN KENNY: It's a very small
language that is very

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.190
domain specific to graphics,
and it has some nice things

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:27.890
that are built in like vectors,
or native types.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.892
So that it's easy to express
kind of what's efficient on

00:43:30.892 --> 00:43:34.180
the graphics card in this
language, and that's what you

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.040
actually pass up to
the graphics card.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.790
The driver compiles it to code
while your program is running,

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.090
while your JavaScript
app is running.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:46.720
And then that's what's run
on the graphics card.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.020
So it can be very efficient,
these little programs run on

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:50.650
the graphics card.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.990
So when you pass the data, these
little programs run on

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:57.370
that data and decide what
shows up on the screen.

00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.850
And the nice thing about it is
that it's the same language

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:04.000
that's used pretty much for all
of OpenGL, but definitely

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.010
for OpenGL ES.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.000
So there's nothing, there's
no translation to

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:08.870
JavaScript or anything.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.950
It's the exact same language.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:13.930
And it's also so small that
you really can look.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.220
I just have the spec, I don't
even refer to anything else

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.880
anymore, because there's so
few features that you can

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.740
learn it all and fit
it in your head.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.596
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:26.596 --> 00:44:29.090
JEROME ETIENNE: Go
ahead, Ilmari.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:33.670
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Yeah, so
GLSL, the one-line pithy

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:39.044
description that I have is that
it's like C for graphics.

00:44:39.044 --> 00:44:41.270
BRENDAN KENNY: But it's not
C for graphics like CG,

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:43.290
it's the other one.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.940
PETE: Cool, I just want to
make one quick comment.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:50.010
If you're watching this live
right now and you have

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:52.300
questions for any of these guys,
make sure you post them

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.150
to the Moderator link, which
is listed there in the

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.420
comments, so that we can
get to your questions.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.150
I'll pass it back
over to Ilmari.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.260
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: OK so
yes, welcome back.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:11.150
This is the Google Chrome
Developers WebGL hangout, and

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:16.370
with me today I have guests,
Brandon Jones from tojico.com

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:21.110
Brendan Kenny from the
Maps Team at Google.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.850
I'm on the Chrome Developer
Relations Team.

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.390
Then we have Jerome
Etienne, who is

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.090
currently somewhere else.

00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.120
He was hiding.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.760
OK, Michael Ensminger,
do you want to do an

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.820
introduction, actually?

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.710
MICHAEL ENSMINGER: Yeah, sure.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:44.690
I was part of the teams that
worked in Rome for example,

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:51.090
and I'm a freelance, and I do
some WebGL development.

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:54.020
I'm also doing this little open
source project called

00:45:54.020 --> 00:46:00.150
Glow, which is like a WebGL
wrapper, if you like GS play

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.945
with shaders really quickly.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.850
Hopefully, I'm starting a big
WebGL project next Tuesday,

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:12.790
which is due to be out in the
end of April, I think.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.060
Fingers crossed.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.310
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Awesome.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:27.480
Then we have Paul Lewis, from
aerotwist.com, and Ricardo

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:32.550
Cabello, of 3JS fame,
and also from Rome.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:40.250
So the topic today is WebGL,
3JS, the meaning of life,

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:46.026
which we haven't gotten around
to yet, but that is fixable.

00:46:46.026 --> 00:46:48.360
Actually, I have a question.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.090
What kind of a content pipeline
do you guys use?

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:56.460
Like if you have a model in Maya
or some other 3D software

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.980
and you want to do it on the web
page, you want to put it

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.310
on the web page, how
do you do that?

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.370
Are there any easy solutions?

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.820
MICHAEL ENSMINGER: Can I say?

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:15.090
I think to Bartek, whatever
his last name is, he did a

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:21.540
little unity exporter, which I
really like, and I use a lot.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:26.360
Because then you go
through that.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.900
It can import from any 3D
package, which is nice.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.850
And what's is really nice is
what I've used a lot, that you

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:43.280
can do small C Sharp plug-ins to
tag objects and do your own

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.470
materials and whatnot,
and customize or

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:47.140
export it real easy.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:52.455
So I'm really a big fan of
that pipeline, basically.

00:47:57.260 --> 00:47:58.480
BRANDON JONES: I'll
second that.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.710
I've actually been working on
a set of Unity exporters and

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.970
whatnot, a lot of it based
on what Bartek was doing.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.820
I was slightly frustrated in
that Unity doesn't actually

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.820
expose APIs for querying
things like visibility

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.280
information or whatnot.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.920
So if you want to use it to
expose full, like game

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.700
appropriate levels, it's going
to take a little bit more work

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.460
on your part.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:33.020
But it does definitely give
you a very good, low-level

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.670
access to your basic meshes,
animations, materials,

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.940
anything like that.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.000
And so as a general
asset exporter, it

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.250
works really well.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:51.860
RICARDO CABELLO: That's a full,
open source net, I will

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:53.110
say, blender.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:58.340
BRANDON JONES: Wait,
why do we all laugh

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.250
when he says blender?

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:00.764
I mean, come on, it's
a good tool.

00:49:00.764 --> 00:49:03.940
BRENDAN KENNY: You people are
terrible, don't laugh.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.060
MICHAEL ENSMINGER: Me and
Ricardo have had this

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.640
discussion 100 times.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.470
Blender is very good.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.500
Blender is a very good
tool, of course.

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.650
RICARDO CABELLO: Yeah, you
can just write any other

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:18.960
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] pattern and
then you actually have access

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.630
to a lot of stuff.

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:25.500
We have it for exporting stuff
directly from [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.916
to 3.js JSON format.

00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:31.780
And we still have to do the
animation and everything.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.800
We have mainly static,
and scene stuff.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:42.430
But to me, you need to get used
to Blender, but once you

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:44.150
get that down, it's easier.

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:45.930
For me, it works pretty
well as a pipeline.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.200
MICHAEL ENSMINGER: Yeah, it was
the pipeline we used for

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.260
Rome, and it worked
pretty well.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.510
RICARDO CABELLO: Yes!

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:08.600
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: I did some
Blender scripting, and the

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:12.400
nice thing about that is that
it's actually pretty simple to

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:16.490
get started and to just export
your objects and data from

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:23.400
Blender in whatever format
you want in your WebGL

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.750
application.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:26.440
So that was great.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.490
And you also get Bones, which
are sometimes a little fiddly

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:34.115
to work with, but it's
definitely doable.

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.970
RICARDO CABELLO: I
need [? Tree. ?]

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.220
[? Tree. ?]

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.450
PETE: What are some of your
favorite WebGL sites and demos

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.780
that you guys have seen?

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.030
BRANDON JONES: glsl.hiroku.org
or .com?

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.850
Ricardo, your little
shader toy?

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:00.290
I love that.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.510
I love it so much.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:05.480
RICARDO CABELLO: It's a
really interesting--

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:11.260
It's like this holds to a lot
of graphics developers that

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.760
they don't like JavaScript at
all, so that website is just

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.240
like something that they can put
their [? brain ?] out and

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:19.670
share what they know without
having to care about the

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.540
JavaScript.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.942
And there's some really
crazy stuff on there.

00:51:23.942 --> 00:51:26.100
I don't even understand half of
what the people are doing.

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.085
JEROME ETIENNE: Maybe a good
time to show some now?

00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.630
Can you show some?

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.170
Some [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.850
RICARDO CABELLO: Let me see.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.790
PETE: So you can try screen
sharing if you'd like, and we

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.162
can see if that will work.

00:51:40.162 --> 00:51:42.350
RICARDO CABELLO:
I'm trying it.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.580
BRENDAN KENNY: Don't break it.

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:45.830
RICARDO CABELLO:
Is it working?

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.850
BRANDON JONES: Yes, yes.

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:51.950
BRENDAN KENNY: Pete might need
to select from screen.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:55.015
PETE: I've got it forced on you,
so you're up on screen.

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.140
RICARDO CABELLO: See
about this one.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.890
Well, I don't check
it too often.

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:13.560
So these guys, basically, this
website, this effect that we

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:19.370
are seeing here, it's
done with this code.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:21.810
There's no textures or anything
being loaded.

00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.990
It's just some code that
generates the textures

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:30.230
dynamically, and even the camera
path and everything.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.730
So you can get stuff like
from this landscape.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:38.340
Again, I have no idea how
to start to do this.

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.590
Let's see.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:42.280
JEROME ETIENNE: Ricardo,
how large is the

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.730
code for those mountains?

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.880
RICARDO CABELLO: Can
you say it again?

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.585
JEROME ETIENNE: How many lines
for the mountains?

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.450
RICARDO CABELLO: Let me see.

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.520
JEROME ETIENNE: Because I
think that's a key point

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.330
[INAUDIBLE].

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:05.765
RICARDO CABELLO: 263.

00:53:05.765 --> 00:53:07.630
JEROME ETIENNE: Yeah, pretty
good for what we see on the

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.800
screen, I would say.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:14.910
RICARDO CABELLO: Yeah, and
there's like so many random

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:20.640
things, like this guy wanted
to have a lot of effects at

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.175
the same time.

00:53:22.175 --> 00:53:23.285
I don't know.

00:53:23.285 --> 00:53:25.490
Maybe it's a little bit too
small what they're showing.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:26.960
Let me see if I can
find another one.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:35.250
The good thing with this website
is that anyone--

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.070
oh, this one doesn't work--

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:42.560
is able to fork a really
working effect.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:47.760
So someone will make like a
sphere or some simple ray

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.900
tracing effect, and then someone
else, like you don't

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.860
even know who they are, they
will come and they will

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.270
improve it.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:58.360
There's a lot of knowledge
sharing from there, that I

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.780
find it very interesting.

00:54:03.388 --> 00:54:05.180
I don't know, like really
crazy things,

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.950
like fractal stuff.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.180
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: I remember
seeing that some guy actually

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.161
implemented a snake game
using a fragment.

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.370
RICARDO CABELLO: There was this
challenge that because

00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:31.150
there are two layers of data,
you can save some states of

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:34.240
the game as colored pixels
on the second layer

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.360
that you don't see.

00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:38.000
So some people started
to try to create

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.950
games using that technique.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.900
The website is a little
bit hard to navigate.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.090
BRANDON JONES: You need
a search function.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:49.140
RICARDO CABELLO: Yeah,
and tagging,

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.390
I guess, and comments.

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.920
Maybe someday it will come.

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.370
BRANDON JONES: There it was.

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:00.780
RICARDO CABELLO: Which one?

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:02.150
BRANDON JONES: Snake.

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:03.940
It's in the bottom corner
of the screen right now.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.800
RICARDO CABELLO: Maybe it
was in the previous one.

00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:16.480
I don't know.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.520
I'm certainly not finding it.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.070
BRANDON JONES: It should be
mentioned, I guess for anybody

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:24.990
who's watching this and not
entirely familiar with the

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.040
WebGL concepts, everything on
this particular site is more

00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.870
or less done entirely
in shader code.

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.410
So that is somewhat limiting to
what can be done, although,

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.570
obviously, you've got a lot of
people here who are more than

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.250
happy to prove that wrong.

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:46.840
But it's not something that's
going to give you access to

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.390
the full range of WebGL
capabilities.

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.050
But it does provide a
fascinating look into what can

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:56.970
be done just with that
GLSL language.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:03.000
RICARDO CABELLO: So I don't know
if it's working at all.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.380
So basically, to make it
a little bit simpler to

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:09.070
understand, what we're seeing
here is just two polygons on

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:13.220
this screen, like one polygon
on one [? tangle ?]

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.720
that goes on the top left,
and one polygon on one

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.030
[? tangle ?] that goes
on the bottom left.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.040
And the rest is just done with
this fragment shader, which

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.320
basically is this code that is
going to be executed for every

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.940
pixel that we see
on the screen.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.240
And we have the position of--

00:56:31.345 --> 00:56:35.060
I don't know whether you can see
any of that-- but from the

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:38.380
code, we have the position
where the pixel is.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.630
From there, we can start to
have some mathematical

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:44.130
functions that will create some
shapes or some whatever.

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:47.265
It's up to you what you can
do with that information.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.320
JEROME ETIENNE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:52.810
RICARDO CABELLO: For the game?

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.560
Yeah.

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.360
PETE: Cool.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.950
Well, we're almost
at our time.

00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:01.430
I want to just sort of open it
up to all of our guests and

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:04.120
say, is there anything you guys
want to add sort of as we

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.372
get ready to wrap
things up today?

00:57:07.372 --> 00:57:12.330
BRENDAN KENNY: I wanted to add
that I know at least a few of

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:15.760
us are on Stack Overflow
and we watch

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.210
the WebGL tag closely.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.590
So if you have any questions
about WebGL,

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.030
definitely get on there.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:24.680
Make sure it's a technical
question, it's not like, what

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.980
should I do, and that's it.

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.280
It should actually be a specific
question, something

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:32.090
that you're facing.

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:34.880
But if [INAUDIBLE], there's
people that will answer.

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:36.880
BRANDON JONES: If you have an
urge to go on Stack Overflow

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.610
and ask, what's the best
WebGL framework?

00:57:39.610 --> 00:57:40.730
Please don't.

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:42.520
That's been asked many,
many times.

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.900
But we're more than happy to
help with technical questions,

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.250
optimization questions, whatever
the case may be.

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.100
BRENDAN KENNY: This is broken,
why is it broken?

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.240
We're definitely
happy to help.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.290
PAUL LEWIS: That question comes
up quite a lot, right,

00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:56.280
when you're working
with WebGL?

00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:57.150
This is broken.

00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.050
Why is it broken?

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.930
I've just got a black screen.

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:01.960
BRANDON JONES: Exactly.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.210
RICARDO CABELLO: Do you all
have a light machine?

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:07.130
BRANDON JONES: Is your camera
facing the right way?

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:08.840
JEROME ETIENNE: But my tricks
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.520
PETE: Cool.

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:13.490
All right, guys.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.420
Well, we're at our time.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:17.200
I want to say thanks everybody
for joining us today.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.360
I hope you all found
it really useful.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.740
Please add the Chrome Developers
Plus page to your

00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:26.620
circles if you haven't done
that already, or +1 us.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.390
Thanks to all our attendees and
speakers, and everybody

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:30.210
for watching.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:30.913
Bye, guys.

00:58:30.913 --> 00:58:31.356
Thanks.

00:58:31.356 --> 00:58:31.620
MALE SPEAKER: Bye.

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:31.799
Thank you.

00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:33.130
ILMARI HEIKKINEN: Bye bye.
