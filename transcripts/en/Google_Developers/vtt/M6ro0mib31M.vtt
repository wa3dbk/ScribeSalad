SILVANO LUCIANI:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.470
Welcome to Google+ Sign-In
for iOS developers.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.570
I'm Silvano Luciani, and I'm a
Developer Programs Engineer

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.590
for the Google+ platform.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.840
XIANGTIAN DAI: I'm Xiangtian
Dai, and I'm a software

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.450
engineer for Google+
iOS platform.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.010
I'm not a native English
speaker, so I have been

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.140
rehearsing this talk many, many
times to make it crystal

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.850
clear to you.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.540
SILVANO LUCIANI: And I'm
Italian, so I might say things

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.610
with a funny accent.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.590
Please forgive me.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.040
So in the next half an hour,
what we want to show you is

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.300
what you can get by integrating
Google+ Sign-In in

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.440
your iOS app.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.020
We will start with the basic
Google+ Sign-In, get users to

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.240
sign into your app.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.480
We will show you two
ways of sharing--

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.720
an active way of sharing,
interactive posts, and a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.180
passive way of sharing,
app activities.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.970
And in the end, we will tell you
something about sign out

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.170
and disconnect, which are two
requirements that we ask you

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.250
to implement if you want
to integrate Google+

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.140
Sign-In in your app.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.150
We will show you examples from
some of our partners, and then

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.240
we will show you the steps to
integrate this functionality

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.910
in your XCode project.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.740
We will show a lot of
resources and URLs.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.840
Don't worry if you don't
get those URLs down.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080
These slides will
be public soon.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.300
The talk is being recorded.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.560
It will be public.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.780
You can get back to it later
with more [? calm. ?]

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.820
But let's start trying to
understand why do you want to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.440
integrate Google+ Sign-In
in your app.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.870
So the first thing, the very
basic thing that you get, is

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.280
login from a trusted provider.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.120
Google is well-known to be safe,
especially when it comes

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.200
to authentication.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.440
For example, we have two-step
verification, which is very

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.260
effective against account
hijacking.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.215
Once you get the very basics,
once you get the user to sign

00:01:53.215 --> 00:01:58.020
in to your app using their
Google+ profile, you get back

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.600
the possibility of customizing
your app, using information

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.600
from their profile and using
information that you can get

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.820
from the Google+ social graph,
which means making the

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.360
experience for every
user more personal.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.570
But you can also get the
possibility of engage, having

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.480
users from your app engage with
their friends on Google+.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.850
This means interactive posts,
content shared from your app

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.325
with an action that will drive
engagement and adoption back

00:02:27.325 --> 00:02:28.370
to your app.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.440
And app activities, which means
activities that the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.500
users are doing on your app
written to Google and surfaced

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.150
in many different ways.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.180
As I mentioned, that's adoptions
back to your app.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.800
So let's start from
the very basic--

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.490
Google+ Sign-In.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.440
I will use one of our partners
as an example--

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.240
Banjo.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.350
They were here in the
Sandbox today.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.210
If you don't know them, it's a
social discovery app that can

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.870
aggregate information from
different social networks and

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.220
show that info based
on your location.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.130
So when you want to start using
Banjo, first thing, you

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.450
need to sign up to
one of the social

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.260
networks that they support.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.760
And you can see a red
button, Google.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.250
You can sign in with
Google to Banjo.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.130
When you click the Sign-In, the
first thing that you will

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.560
see is our consent dialogue.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.990
We designed this consent
dialogue very carefully with

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.350
one thing in mind-- the user.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.890
Users want to have control
over certain things.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.090
And one of the most important
things for the users is

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.770
controlling which of their
friends will be

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.300
shared with an app.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.150
Which is why, as you can see
in the first line of the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.020
consent dialogue, they can
click, "edit list," and they

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.610
can edit, add or subtract
circles from the circles that

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.030
will be shared with your app.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.600
This doesn't mean that we are
sending your app information

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.610
about the circles.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.460
We will send the users that are
contained in those circles

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.590
as a flat list.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.930
There's another line, which
is very important,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.450
is the third line.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.300
Users care about what will
be visible to whom in the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.100
activities that they
do on your app.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.089
We will get back to that line
later when talking about app

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.149
activities.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.900
So once I'm signed in to Banjo,
it's already different.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.680
I have my profile picture
on the top-right corner.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.330
And this is the very basic
personalization

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.330
that you can do.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.940
There's a lot more that you can
do by getting data from

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.230
our public data API.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.570
You can also get the list of
friends, a list of my friends,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.950
that are already using this app,
which means that I can

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.230
start my experience with Banjo
not from scratch, not from

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.110
nothing, but interacting with
some of the friends that I

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.030
already have.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.140
To get started in integrating
Google+ Sign-In in your

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.490
project, the first thing that
you will need to do is go to

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.410
the Google API Console.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.140
The Google API Console is a tool
that will allow you to

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.290
manage access to all
the Google APIs

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.100
for all your project.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.310
The first thing, you will need
to create a project.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.840
The second thing, you will need
to create an OAuth 2.0

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.430
Client ID, which will allow
us to track the

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.670
usage of every API.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.740
In your case, this will be a
client ID for an installed

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.460
application of type iOS.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.850
Now, you can find detailed stats
of this procedure on our

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.630
developer documentation.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.700
One thing that I want to point
out is three parameters which

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.450
are very specific for
your iOS app.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.630
The first one is the
bundle ID, which is

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.260
identifying your app.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.570
You will configure this later in
the XCode project as well.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.330
And we will see why it's
important, because it's the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.340
way your app will handle the
data that is coming back from

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.560
the authentication.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.260
The second parameter is
the App Store ID.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.150
That's the ID of your app
on the App Store.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.600
And it's very important, because
in some cases users

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.400
might try to interact with your
app without having the

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.860
app installed on their
iOS device.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.410
If we have this correctly
configured, it means that we

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.900
can redirect the user to the App
Store ID, to the page of

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.380
your app, have them install your
app, and then using deep

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.040
linking, they can go back in
the same context what they

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.350
were trying to interact
with your app.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.290
Now, I've just mentioned
deep linking.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.710
How many of you know what
deep linking is?

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.420
Ah, good number, good number.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.440
Good job.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.410
So the third thing that
you can do here

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.720
is enable deep linking.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.880
And deep linking will allow
you to specify strings.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.560
The format is up to you.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.790
You can determine whatever
format is better for your app.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.780
And this will allow you to bring
the user in the exact

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.980
context where they wanted to
interact with your app, which

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.370
could be a specific view
where they can

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.980
perform a specific action.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.150
And we will see more
about this later.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.250
XIANGTIAN DAI: Now you have
registered your app in Google

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.310
APIs Console, it is time to
download Google+ iOS SDK.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.925
You download it from
developers.googl

00:07:12.925 --> 00:07:19.080
e.com/+/mobile/ios.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.990
And also, check out our online
references there.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.730
Now that you have downloaded
Google iOS SDK, there are four

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.600
steps to set up your XCode
configuration for your

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.520
application target.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.850
The first step is to drag the
following items from Google+

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.655
iOS SDK to your project--

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.540
GooglePlus.framework,
GoogleOpenSource.framework,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.870
and then GooglePlus.bundle.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.240
GooglePlus.framework contains
header files and libraries for

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.690
the Google+ iOS SDK.

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.970
GoogleOpenSource.framework
contains open source files

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.000
provided by Google that
is used in this SDK.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.790
However, if you're already
using some of these open

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.210
source files, do not
include .framework.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.610
Instead, include individual
files under the open source

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.710
directory of the SDK.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.930
Only include these files you are
not already using so that

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.090
you do not end up with
duplicate symbols.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:29.110
GooglePlus.bundle contains
images and strings used by the

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.420
Google+ Sign-In button.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.480
Step two.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:41.860
On the info tab,
add a URL type.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.750
Use your bundle ID for both the

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.280
identifier and the URL scheme.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.160
You must use the same bundle ID
that matches what you have

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.880
registered in Google
APIs Console.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.980
This is how your app gets data
from authentication, sharing,

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.130
and deep linking.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.730
Step three, build
Settings tab.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:12.290
Find other linker flags, and
add dash Objective C. This

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.760
linker flag is needed for
libraries with Objective C

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.000
categories to link properly.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.570
And step four, build
Phases tab.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:29.460
In section, add binary to
libraries and the following

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.440
frameworks--

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.370
Security.framework and the
SystemConfiguration.framework.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.705
These frameworks are needed
for the Google+ iOS SDK.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.370
Now let's go with
some code setup.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.840
First, you need to import
GooglePlus.h and

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.920
GoogleOpenSource.h.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.490
You can import them in
individual .m files as needed,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.660
or you can also import them in
your precompiled header file.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.710
Second, you need to initialize
a client ID property of the

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:08.100
GPPSignIn instance before
using this object.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.160
This client ID identifies your
app to Google services.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.730
You get this client ID string by
registering your app in the

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.990
Google APIs Console.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:25.170
If your app requires more
permissions from the user, in

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.670
addition to what the default
plus.login scope provides, you

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:35.160
need also to declare this list
of scopes and do this

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.120
initialization before using this
Google+ Sign-In object.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.230
Now, adding a Sign-In button
to your app is very easy.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.810
All you have to do is to drag a
button to your storyboard or

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:55.790
XIB file and set its custom
class to GPPSignInButton.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.192
And don't forget to remove
the default label.

00:11:03.192 --> 00:11:07.310
The SDK will handle the
appearance of the button.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.500
You can also customize its style
and the color scheme to

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.540
match your app's
look and feel.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:19.280
If you want, you can also draw
your own button, as long as it

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.500
meets our branding guidelines
at this location.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.850
Now, if you draw your own
button, don't forget to call

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.950
Authenticate method on the
GPPSignIn instance.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.420
This starts authentication
flow when

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.670
user taps on the button.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.460
To complete the authentication
flow, you

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.290
need to do two things.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:47.250
First, in your AppDelegate, let
GPPURLHandler handle the

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.500
incoming URL.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.870
Second, one of your classes
must implement the

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:01.710
GPPSignInDelegate protocol,
for example, your relevant

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.000
ViewController class.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.090
And you need to assign an
instance of this class as a

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.020
delegate to the GPPSignIn
object.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.380
In this class, you implement
a method called

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.630
finishedWithAuth.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.800
This method will be
called when the

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.060
authentication flow completes.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.750
As a side note, when user
finishes signing in, we save

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.770
user's credentials in the
user's private keychain.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.700
This is so that the user does
not need to type in their

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.160
password again when your
app starts next time.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.700
In order to make use of
this feature, call

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.950
trySilentAuthentication.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.060
There are two tips I
would like to offer

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.880
for the Sign-In flow.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:00.840
First, user will be directed
to another

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.230
app to compete sign-in.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:06.390
So that user will type into the
username and password in

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.210
another app.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.910
This means your app will
go into the background.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:14.990
Do not assume that your app,
when user has already signed

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.020
in, when your app comes back
to the foreground.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.310
User could have declined to sign
in, or they could simply

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:28.000
use this Home button to switch
back to your app.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.120
Instead, using the programming
interface that we just

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.990
discussed to get a notification
that the user has

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.170
finished signing in.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.410
Second, to provide the user
with a single sign-in

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.870
experience we always prefer
to use the Google+ app, if

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.660
installed, to handle the
user signing in.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.520
If this is not the behavior
you want, that's fine.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.390
Simply set the attemptSSO
property of the GPPSignIn

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:05.150
object to "no." This way, the
SDK will always switch to

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.835
browser to handle
user's sign in.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.770
Now user has signed in, let's
say we want to get the user's

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.700
profile image and their
display name.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.080
To do that, we use
three objects--

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.680
a service, a query, and
a completion handler.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.900
The service object identifies
which Google

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.230
service you're accessing.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.690
In our case, it's the Google+
service, which you should have

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.680
enabled in Google APIs Console
for your project.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.340
We get this object by calling
PlusService method on the

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.815
GPPSignIn instance.

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:54.070
A query is a request you send
to this Google service.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.640
In our case, it's the query to
get the people's profile.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.970
And then we get this
object by calling

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:07.490
queryForPeopleGetWithUserId
method, with the argument

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:13.850
"me." This special string
represents the current user.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.210
And the completion handler is a
block that gets called when

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.260
the request comes back.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.340
In our case, we're expecting
a GTLPlusPerson object.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:34.050
This object contains information
about the user.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.290
Both users' profile image and
their display name can be

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.980
retrieved from this topic
as its properties.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:46.930
Finally, execute the query on
the Plus service with the

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.080
completion handler, and don't
forget to check for errors

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.200
inside the completion handler.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.620
SILVANO LUCIANI: So now that you
have the users, it's time

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.680
to engage with their friends.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.350
And the way to do this is
use interactive posts.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.950
And I will use the Fancy
as an example.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.720
The Fancy is another partner.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.320
They were in our Sandbox
yesterday.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.470
If you don't know them, it's an
app where people curate a

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.685
list of items, places, and
you can fancy items if

00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:18.600
you like the items.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.570
You can buy items, add
them to at list, or

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.010
just share with friends.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.240
This is an example of
things that you

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.950
can find on the Fancy.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.360
A very fancy watch, I have
to admit, on the bottom.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.810
And the USB Hub House, which
is one of my favorites.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.980
But I decide to focus
on this article.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.550
Summer is coming.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.960
I think that a hanging cliff
cabana, it's something that

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.040
you want to have.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.180
And for $700, it's
a real deal.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.110
So let's say I want to share
it with my friends.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.610
On the top-right corner,
I have the Share icon.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.580
When I click the Share icon,
I can see Google+

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.960
is one of the options.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.120
When I click on Google+, I can
see the Share box for an

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.170
interactive post.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.280
Looks like your average Share
box, but it's not.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.589
I'm sharing, I'm adding some
text, saying this is really

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.250
handy for the summer.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.970
You can see in the center
what I'm sharing.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.530
But also, there's a button--

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:20.220
Buy.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.040
And that's what we call
a call to action.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.619
I'm not just sharing this with
my friends, I'm also telling

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.310
them, hey, you should
buy this thing.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.420
You should do something with
this thing, because I think

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.220
that this thing is really
important for you.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.120
And what happens when I share
this with my friends?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.030
They receive a notification
across all the Google

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.900
properties.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.820
And in this example, we have
YouTube, we have Google Drive,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.090
we have Google Search.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:52.800
But this will surface also
on Gmail, G+, and so on.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.970
And if they have the Google+ app
installed on their mobile

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.090
device, they will receive a
notification on their mobile

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.200
device as well.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.510
So this is me receiving
the notification.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.300
I'm telling myself to
buy this thing.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.930
When I open it, this is how
the Share box is rendered.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.180
And what happens when
I click Buy?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.080
You remember when we said deep
linking, putting people,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:20.850
users, in the context where
we want them to be?

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.500
They not only see the object
that I'm sharing.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.660
Adding to cart, buying us a
gift, is one tap away from

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.930
them at this point.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.830
They just need to tap on the
green or blue button, and they

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.450
will perform the action that
we wanted them to perform.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.980
Notify the Google+ properties,
drive back to your app.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.190
XIANGTIAN DAI: To share from
your app, the first thing to

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.100
do is to get the GPPShareBuilder
object.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.590
And you get this object by
calling the shareDialog method

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.570
on the GPPShare instance.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.520
This GPPShareBuilder object
allows you to set the

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.110
parameters for your
share dialog.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.070
One of the parameters you can
set is the PrefillText, which

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:18.470
allows you, as the developer,
to prepopulate text for the

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.600
shareDialog, so the
user does not have

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:21.850
to start from scratch.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.440
You can also set
a URL to share.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.240
The shareDialog shows a preview
of the content of this

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.650
URL so user knows what
they are sharing.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.270
Now, to make it an interactive
post, you need to call the

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.320
method named
setCallToActionButtonWithLabel.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.570
This method adds a Call to
Action button to the post.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.870
A Call to Action button consists
of three parts.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:55.070
First, a label, which is one of
the predefined texts on our

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.160
developer site that best
describes your action.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.050
For example, Bookmark.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.510
Second, a URL, which must be
on the same domain as the

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.900
content URL.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.650
And then lastly, an optional
deepLinkID.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:16.640
The deepLinkID is a string
understood by your app that

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.160
navigates into a particular
view of your app.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.520
This is so that when a user
taps on the Call to Action

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.500
button, they are taken directly
into the right place

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.500
inside of your app.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.190
If your app is not installed,
the user will be prompted for

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.780
it to download and
install your app.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:40.930
And then they are taken directly
into the right place

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.820
inside your app.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:44.070
Deep linking is cross-platform.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.165
In order to make the interactive
post shared from

00:20:51.165 --> 00:20:56.770
your iOS app, handled by your
Android app, and vice versa,

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:01.520
make sure that your OAuth2
clients, or your both iOS and

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.615
Android apps in the Google
APIs Console,

00:21:04.615 --> 00:21:06.590
are in the same project.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.330
And also make sure that
both clients have

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.900
deep linking enabled.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.840
And finally, call the
[? share ?] method on this

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.320
GPPShareBuilder instance, and
share dialog will be displayed

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.570
to the user.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.160
SILVANO LUCIANI: So after the
active sharing that you've

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.810
seen with interactive posts--

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.300
users want to share something
with their friends--

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.390
we go to passive sharing,
app activities.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.720
And I will use Flixter, which
is another of our partners.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.130
And they were in the
Sandbox today.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.370
If you know Flixter, it's a
community where users can

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.800
share reviews and ratings and
movies, and they can also

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.450
invite each other to
go watch a movie

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.870
somewhere at some time.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.050
So an app activity, it's
something that the app is

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.360
writing to Google on behalf
of the users.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.520
The user gave consent
to the app when they

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.110
signed in to Google.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.020
And this time, we will focus
on a different part of the

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.450
consent dialogue.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.480
As you can see, it's showing
us which type of activities

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.420
Flixter wants to write.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.600
And it's asking us, who do you
want to be able to view these

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.440
activities on Google?

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.550
And again, we can choose
all our circles.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.500
We can choose some
of our circles.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.580
As a top-level option, we can
choose to keep it private.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.370
There are some things that we
want to keep it private, and

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.820
we don't want to share
with anyone or be

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.630
visible to anyone else.

00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.950
We can do it right here.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.920
To show what app activities are
about, we have an example

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.320
of a movie on Flixter.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.590
And from here, there are two
things that could trigger an

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.600
app activity to be written.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.530
The first one is, I can say that
I want to see this movie.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.430
That will trigger
a Want activity.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.660
Or I can add the rating
for that movie.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.240
And that will trigger
a Review activity.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.210
I mentioned two different
types--

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.200
Want and Review.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.010
We have 10 different types.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.920
As you can see, some
are more generic.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.930
Some are more specific.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.080
If you have a compelling use
case that are not in this

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.670
list, please let us know, and we
will consider if it's worth

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:28.360
implementing your use case.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.740
So what happens after Flixter
has written an app activity?

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.570
Well, the first place where
we started surfacing app

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.010
activities is the profile.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.410
So as you can see, there's a
list of things that I did on

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.590
Flixter, movies that I want to
see, movies that I review.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.370
This is visible to all the
people coming to my profile

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.500
that I selected in the
consent dialog.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:58.090
And as you can see, I can check
to whom these activities

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:59.820
are currently visible.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.330
What if I change my mind?

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:08.140
I can choose to go back and edit
the circles again, making

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.280
this wider or smaller.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.800
What happens if there's a
specific activity that I want

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.940
to share with more people?

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:19.200
I can do it from here.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.800
I can actually do many
different things.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.820
I can delete the activity, I
can report the activity as

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.850
spam if I don't like what
the app is doing.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.700
But if the press the button in
the middle, at this point I

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.250
can share it to Google+, with
the public, or with the circle

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.960
of my friends that I know
they like to destroy

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.200
world with a hammer.

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.650
There is another thing that we
started doing and that we

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:45.410
announced a couple of weeks
ago, Which is search

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.220
integration.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.660
So we started surfacing
activities from the users in

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.000
Google Search.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.660
So if we search on Google for
Flixter, on the right you can

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.440
see that we are telling you
which are the most popular

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.510
activities on Flixter
by Google users.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:05.330
And if you click on any of those
activities, they will go

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.290
back to the Flixter website.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.490
XIANGTIAN DAI: Before your app
can write app activities, you

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.560
need to declare all types of
app activities your app is

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.275
about to write before
user signs in.

00:25:23.275 --> 00:25:27.600
This is so that user has a
chance to review the list of

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.770
app activities.

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:35.070
To do that, I find Actions
property of the GPPSignIn

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:39.080
instance to an array of strings,
each of which is an

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.300
app activity type.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.490
Now, to write app activity,
first you need to construct a

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.460
Moment object, which represents
app activity.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:57.445
Assign the type of this Moment
object to be the type of the

00:25:57.445 --> 00:26:02.750
app activity, and assign the
target of this Moment object

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.230
to be the target of
the app activity--

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.730
in our case, a URL.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:12.800
Please note that we require
certain schema.org microdata

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.420
on the content of this URL.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.970
Refer to our developer
doc for more details.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:24.050
Now, with this Moment object,
it's time to construct our

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.000
query object.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.960
We'll construct our
query object to

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.950
insert this Moment object.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:34.030
And this query consists
of three objects.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.640
First, the Moment object that
we just constructed.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.180
Second, a special string, "me,"
which represents the

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.730
current user.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.500
And third, a constant for
the default collection.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:55.560
Now again, execute the query
on the plusService.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.410
And in the completion handler,
you can check whether your app

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:02.430
activity has been successfully
written or not.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.100
SILVANO LUCIANI: So the last
thing, as we mentioned, is

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.590
something that we ask you
implement in your developer

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.810
policies, sign out, and a
disconnect functionality.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.480
Now, how many of you know
what to sign out means?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.500
I hope everyone.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.120
Sign out means that when the
users are signed into your

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.620
app, they get the personalized
experience.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.490
When they are signed
out, they don't.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.390
So you don't show them in the
app any data that you retrieve

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.110
from that profile and that is
specific to their profile.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.090
Disconnect is something
different.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:44.230
It means that the user tried
your app, it worked for

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.850
awhile, the love is finished.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:48.520
They don't want your
app anymore.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.800
They want to delete any link
between your app and their

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.410
Google+ account.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:57.630
So for you, this means that you
also need to delete all

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.420
the information that you
obtained from the Google+ API.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:04.600
Now, there are some important
exceptions to this.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.270
For example, if you need to
keep some information to

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.500
comply with laws or regulation,
let's say as a

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.910
proof of purchase,
you can do it.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.065
And you can find more details
at developers.googl

00:28:15.065 --> 00:28:20.550
e.com/+/policies, all that you
can keep, and all that you

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.800
cannot keep.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.180
XIANGTIAN DAI: The GPPSignIn
object already implements the

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.490
signOut and Disconnect
methods.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.290
So all you have to do is to call
these methods as needed.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:35.490
And don't forget to clean
up user data.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.820
Both signOut and Disconnect
methods remove user

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.950
credentials from memory
and from keychain.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.350
However, there's a difference
between these two methods.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.800
SignOut removes user
credentials

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.880
for the current device.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.140
On the other hand, Disconnect
revokes user credentials for

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.250
the user connecting to the
app across all devices.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.910
If you want to know whether
disconnect succeeds or not,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:11.910
implement the optional method in
GPPSignInDelegate protocol

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.900
called didDisconnectWithError.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.670
And you can check the
results there.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.380
SILVANO LUCIANI: So to conclude,
why do you want to,

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.720
when you go out from this
room, start integrating

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.290
Google+ in your iOS
app immediately?

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.120
Because of all of
these points.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:33.740
It's easy.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.020
The integration is very
easy when you use

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.260
the Google+ iOS SDK.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.810
You get the login from
a trusted provider.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.870
You get Profile and Social
Graph access.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:50.000
And also, you get to drive
adoption and engagement using

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.040
interactive posts, and you get
re-engagement using app

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.390
activities.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.170
You've seen some examples.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.120
You've seen all of those
partners are being very

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.000
successful with their
integration, and they're

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.740
improving their apps and the
experience for their users.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.800
So go out and try it out.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.985
And thanks for coming.

00:30:11.985 --> 00:30:13.235
XIANGTIAN DAI: Thank you.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.320
SILVANO LUCIANI: Now, if you
have any questions, please use

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.570
the two mics.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:33.900
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.590
Thanks for the talk.

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.650
I just have a quick question
about analytics on the

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.160
interactive posts.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.310
I was wondering if there's a way
that you can track who is

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.970
making the interactive posts
and then which users are

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.790
clicking on those posts, as a
way to be able to identify

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:55.760
users and then ultimately
influencers and people who are

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.630
easily influenced.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.950
SILVANO LUCIANI: So you can
get aggregate data.

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:06.240
There's no way of tracking who
is sharing, because it's an

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:06.570
[? added ?]

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.070
Share box.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:14.692
So everything that's happening
inside the Google + iOS app.

00:31:14.692 --> 00:31:15.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.520
So right.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.890
It's outside the scope
of being able to

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.390
identify to a user.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:20.170
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.390
But you can get aggregate data
on how your interactive posts

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.430
are performing.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.930
And if you have different
platforms, Android Web and

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:32.340
iOS, you can see which platform
is working best, and

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:33.590
things like that.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.710
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
regarding the storage of the

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.730
identity in the keychain.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.240
Sometimes, I found on several
apps, that you need to store a

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.040
different type of security.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.550
Like, always available,
only when

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.370
devices is first unlocked.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.110
Can you comment a little
bit on that one

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.260
and how it will work?

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.670
Especially in the case when
you have, let's say, two

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.010
iPhone devices that are using
Google Sign-In, and they're

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:04.355
trying to exchange information
with the app is backgrounded.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.960
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yes.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.690
Actually, when user successfully
signed in, we

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.600
store the user's credential in
the private keychain, it's

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.830
actually private to your app.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.240
So each app will hold its own
storage of user's credentials.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.710
So we don't have sharing
between apps.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:25.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:30.350
But it's more regardless to
there's an attribute for that

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.270
keychain [? attribute ?]

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.330
that's been written.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.710
So if my application is
backgrounded, and it's waking

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:41.200
up by a service like Bluetooth
[? profile ?] connection, I

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.945
won't be able to get
the credential.

00:32:44.945 --> 00:32:46.585
So that will bubble up errors.

00:32:46.585 --> 00:32:50.280
So I was wondering if there
is a solution for that.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.480
XIANGTIAN DAI: Well, if we
cannot get the keychain, and

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.110
you try to authenticate,
we'll always invoke the

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.240
authentication flow again.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.300
It's just an optional
optimization thing, that we

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:07.500
try to save you the time by
giving them the choice not to

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.600
type the password again.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.460
Actually, giving you, as
developer, choice to use this

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.410
functionality.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.240
So if it's not available, then,
well, we just don't have

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.404
this functionality, and users
have to sign in again.

00:33:17.404 --> 00:33:17.868
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:17.868 --> 00:33:19.724
Thanks.

00:33:19.724 --> 00:33:21.120
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.100
I have a question about the
Google Disconnect and the

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.010
deleting of data that you've
gathered from their profile.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.610
So here's the hypothetical
scenario.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:36.900
Say I've implemented a sign-in
where I've used some of the

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.640
Google+ profile information to
assist a registration to an

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.205
account of my own, of
my application.

00:33:45.205 --> 00:33:47.750
And say I pull up an email
address, and I've gotten

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.580
permission to gather email
address and then have asked

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.760
somebody to enter in their own
password to create their own

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.110
account on my application.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.700
Now, if somebody then
disconnects the app, and I

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.160
have gathered that email
information to seed my

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:09.119
registration, must I also delete
that email address?

00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:15.310
Or does that email address
become my own data?

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.760
SILVANO LUCIANI: So if you
got the address from the

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.960
Google+ API, yeah.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.969
Unless there's some law or
regulation that's asking you

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:27.780
to keep the email address for
any reason, then the answer is

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.974
yes, from the Google+ API.

00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:33.754
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:34.360
SILVANO LUCIANI: Oh, OK.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.610
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:38.010
AUDIENCE: Hi--

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.320
SILVANO LUCIANI: But that's
a different API.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.710
AUDIENCE: If you presented a
form for the user, and you

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:46.500
pre-filled it, and they have
entered that, then they're

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.050
giving that information
to you.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.219
So that's separate, necessarily,
from the

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.340
information that's
coming back.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.210
So that's going to be covered
by your own terms.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.400
So you wouldn't necessarily
have to

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.180
delete that stuff, then.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.510
Thank you.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.660
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.890
So it's another thing.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.650
It's another way of getting the
email address, which is

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.590
using another scope,
userinfo.email.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.170
In that case, it doesn't come
from the Google+ API, so you

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:11.165
can keep it.

00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:14.870
AUDIENCE: Oh, if I added it
as one of the scope--

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:15.830
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:18.520
It's an additional scope, and
it will be shown in the

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.340
consent dialog.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:21.960
So you would see an additional
line, which would say, this

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.700
app wants to know your
email address.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.510
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.395
SILVANO LUCIANI: And that will
be shown to the user.

00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:26.790
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.580
OK.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.830
Thank you.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.463
SILVANO LUCIANI: I
think that's it.

00:35:34.463 --> 00:35:35.170
Thanks.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:35.560
XIANGTIAN DAI: Thank you.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.050
Thank you.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.550
[APPLAUSE]
