PETE LEPAGE: --Thursday.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.080
I want to welcome Paul, who's
joining us from London.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.950
Paul, you want to say hi?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.290
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.310
PETE LEPAGE: Excellent.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.760
So today's a kind of cool day.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.430
Today's the first of a new
weekly series that we're going

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.670
to be starting for Mobile Web
Thursdays, where we're going

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.850
to be coming to you with all
kinds of really cool stuff

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.970
about mobile web development.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.990
Today, we're going to focus on
the launch of Chrome for

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.630
Android, the latest build
that shipped yesterday.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.860
Paul, do you want to tell us
a little bit about what's

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.324
special about this new build?

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:46.280
PAUL KINLAN: What's special?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.200
PAUL KINLAN: Everything.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.840
It's actually a really exciting
build, right?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.020
Because this is the first time
where we're getting close to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.530
parity with the desktop.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.160
We both wanted web developers
to have a first class

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.740
experience when developing
for the web,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.180
across all factory devices.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.800
And obviously in the past,
we've led with desktop.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.449
And then, we launched,
I think 16, and then

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.140
upgraded to 18 on Android.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.030
And now we're at 25, only a week
behind the actual desktop

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.820
launch, like version
25 Chrome.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.590
So for me, that's the
most exciting thing.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.310
Because developers are at
least starting to get

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.124
consistent platforms to target
across all form factors.

00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:25.050
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320
I think that's sort of the
neatest thing for me, as well.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.000
The fact that we are now on M
25, or only a week behind the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.470
desktop build is
pretty awesome.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.700
So if you haven't updated your
Chrome for Android on your

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.540
Android device, you
should go do that.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.070
If you just go into the Play
store, if you haven't seen the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.590
update pop up, and check for any
available updates so that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.530
you can get that.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.290
PAUL KINLAN: I actually think
you need a user permission

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.810
change, as well, for the audio
stuff, which we're going to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.560
talk about later.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.110
So if you see it sitting
there, press

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.520
update, and go ahead.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.320
I think that we'll talk
about that in a bit.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.080
But that's a really cool new
feature that I'm really

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.333
excited about.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.730
So why don't we dive in and take
a look at some of the new

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.930
things that are available
in Chrome for Android.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.410
So there's a couple of ones that
are kind of cool that are

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.500
a little bit harder to show.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.620
But some of those are like,
improved scrolling

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.110
performance.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.870
So I'm going to bring
up a page here.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.140
And I'm just going to create a
new tab, and do a quick search

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.530
for how browsers work.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.560
PAUL KINLAN: That's
a big doc, right?

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.820
PETE LEPAGE: And that's a
huge document, right?

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.670
So that's the one
on HTML5 Rocks.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.000
So if I pull this guy up and
let it finish loading.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.050
In the past, if you started
scrolling on here, what you'd

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.060
find would be that you'd get
big blank spots showing up.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.680
You'd get pieces where content
just didn't render.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.250
But now, notice that as I'm
scrolling, we're getting very

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.220
few of those blank spots--
and of course, as we

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.300
go through a demo.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.570
But every once in a while, we
get these areas where we get

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.510
sort of blurred out text.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.140
What's happening is the
browser's rendering low

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.950
quality images, effectively, so
that it can show and scroll

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.360
quickly so that we can see
what's going on, so that we

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.050
get a much better experience.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.560
And we get a much smoother
scrolling experience going on.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.150
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.610
So everyone knows, this is
like basically a threaded

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.250
compositor now.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.255
So in the past, essentially,
paints and everything used to

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:44.370
block the--

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.730
if you did a paint and then a
render, it would block the

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.010
actual browser for that time.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.690
And now it doesn't.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.830
It's on a completely
separate thread.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.820
Internally, we called it
imple-side threading, or

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.000
imple-side painting,
I'm sorry.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.660
It's like a completely
obtuse name.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.910
But essentially, what it does
is exactly what Pete just

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.890
described, where you'll
do a scroll.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.510
And we've got low resolution
versions of the page that's

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.010
all rendered out anyway.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.190
We've got low resolution
versions of the page which we

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.340
can quickly show to the user.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.020
And then when the scrolling
stops, we swap that out.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.395
And we give it back to the
user in full, high res.

00:05:14.395 --> 00:05:16.490
And we think this is a better
way of doing it, because

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.630
that's one of the worst things
that we have at the moment on

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.660
the mobile web, is if you
scroll, you lose track of

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.420
everything.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.330
The app would try to paint,
but the user wouldn't see

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.570
anything, because we
couldn't keep up.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.240
And this is a big improvement
for the way that you develop

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.050
apps, or at least the
way that your users

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.070
see your site snaps.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.630
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.700
This is a really cool one.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.370
And it really is going to, I
think, increase the feeling

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.060
that users have of a responsive
browser and a

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.700
responsive website.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.820
So that's one.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.900
One of the next ones is really
sort of improved performance

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.820
in pinch to zoom sites.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.780
So in sites where you're going
to go to them and you're going

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.530
to go and do pinch to zoom,
the performance there is

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.945
significantly improved.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.110
Paul, do you want to talk
a little bit about that?

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.690
It's kind of hard to
show this off.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.200
But I think it's basically a
benefit of having the threaded

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.190
compositor now.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.830
The interesting thing, and we
found this out a couple of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.260
weeks ago, is that we always
have this like 300 millisecond

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.543
delay on clicks.

00:06:22.543 --> 00:06:24.800
You click a link, or
click anything.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.560
Obviously, it needs to work out
whether you're going to

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.270
try to do another
type of gesture.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.930
And that whole subsystem's been
starting to be improved.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.420
But the interesting thing is if
you have your viewport set,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.050
which we might talk about
viewport today, but we

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.093
probably have a whole dedicated
session for

00:06:38.093 --> 00:06:39.000
viewports in the future.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.240
Because it's quite a
complex subject.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.100
If you have your viewport set to
device width, then we don't

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.570
even do that 300 millisecond
delay.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.261
Because we know that you're not
going to do another type

00:06:49.261 --> 00:06:49.894
of gesture.

00:06:49.894 --> 00:06:50.740
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.180
PAUL KINLAN: Because it's
impossible to do, basically.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.050
So that's the whole subset of
performance improvements that

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.766
have been coming along with the
viewport and the page to

00:06:58.766 --> 00:07:00.600
zoom stuff and everything.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.510
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.860
I think that one's
pretty slick.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.810
And that one's a nice user
improvement, as well.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.390
PAUL KINLAN: In theory, it means
that you don't need to

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.110
use FastClick.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.420
But obviously, every other
browser out there that is

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:14.280
using FastClick has this
other problem, as well.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.340
So we'll probably see that
type of thing live for a

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.150
little while.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.500
But the idea is that we want to
give you the ability just

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.610
to not have to use
that library.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:21.870
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.610
And well, one of the things that
we were talking about a

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.670
couple weeks ago while we were
in London for Edge was talking

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.490
with the developers
of FastClick.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.670
And talking about ways that we
could potentially detect

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.640
Chrome for Android with
the proper things set.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.880
And if everything is set
properly, not even load

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.140
FastClick, so that it doesn't
even have to load.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.740
There's less JavaScript
running on your page.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.130
Your page is more responsive
because of that.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.930
And your clicks happen pretty
much instantly.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.610
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.820
PETE LEPAGE: So I think that's
a pretty slick one.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.160
There's also a whole bunch of
work that we did around making

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.670
sure that we had the latest
JavaScript engine.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.970
So effectively, the previous
version of

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.330
Chrome was Chrome 18.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.410
We've moved seven versions of
Chrome since then, and had

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.820
seven releases since
that initial time.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.650
So we now have a much faster
JavaScript engine with all of

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.120
the latest V8 stuff in there.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.370
Again, that one's a little
hard to demo, as well.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.910
So don't really have a lot to
show there, but I think we

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.275
have something cool for the--

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:32.419
PAUL KINLAN: I mean, people can
just go to the SunSpider

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:33.130
stuff if they want.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.600
PETE LEPAGE: That's
a good point.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.220
PAUL KINLAN: We've been talking
with Paul Lewis and a

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.080
couple of other guys as well,
internally, about the

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.370
JavaScript performance, OK, it's
a big factor in how your

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.790
application responds
to the users.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.770
But bigger areas of improvement
that you could

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.840
potentially have as a developer
when you're

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.700
optimizing your site are
actually around rendering

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.970
paint, and actually not
forcing layouts.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.150
Because obviously, the browsers
on mobile phones are,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.270
in order of magnitude, slower
than desktop machines.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.850
So we have a bigger benefit in
reducing the number of reflows

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.420
and recalcs and all those type
of things, than necessarily

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.640
the JavaScript stuff itself.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.840
But that being said, we
are keeping parity.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.960
And that's the aim, is to keep
parity with the desktop now.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.290
So I think that's a really
powerful thing.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.350
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.770
So now we've got another whole
set of features where we've

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.560
got some really cool demos.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.280
If you want to follow along or
try any of these demos, we can

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.660
put the link on the screen
for the demos.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.860
But you can see the link is
there, and you can try some of

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.710
these yourself.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.040
So the first one I want to have
a quick peek at is the

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.270
audio demo.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.720
And one of the big changes there
is now, audio will play

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.400
even if Chrome's in
the background.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.790
And Paul had mentioned that
you need a background--

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:54.170
you need a user permission to
update Chrome for Android.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.090
And this is why.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.660
So if I were to go and say, hey,
I want to start playing

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.100
this podcast.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.730
Which we'll go and
hit play here.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.020
Sure enough, OK.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.460
You can hear it in
the background.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.770
Now, if I leave Chrome and go
somewhere else within my phone

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.120
and start doing other things,
the podcast keeps going.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.270
So if I'm using something like
Google music to play music, if

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.750
I'm listening to podcasts or
doing anything else, all of

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.120
that music or all of that audio
still keeps playing,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.140
even with Chrome not as
the primary piece.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.370
So I can go and check
out some news, see

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.140
what's going on there.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.430
It's a pretty slick and kind
of cool little feature.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.060
Paul, do you have anything you
want to add to this one?

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.650
PAUL KINLAN: No, this actually,
so this is--

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.840
I think we're playing the HM
part as well, I think.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.870
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.210
PAUL KINLAN: This is actually
a feature that Mike

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.750
[INAUDIBLE] wanted
quite a long time

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.740
ago inside the browser.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.900
He's had a bug open for
it for quite a while.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.310
And we finally have been able to
actually fix it, because of

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.580
all the kind of changes
and everything.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.670
So I'm hoping Mike's happy.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:58.900
This is a big shout out
to him, as well.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.410
Because it's actually
a big change.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.920
There's a lot of things that you
might have to, well, you

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.256
don't have to worry too much
about web audio at the moment.

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:08.670
But you might be caught-- there
might be situations

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.160
where you would want to
know that the user's

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.090
background of your page.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.185
So you need to still be
respectful of the user if

00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:14.340
you're playing audio on.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.290
You might have to deal
with that, still.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.720
Actually, you probably should
deal with that.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.900
Just be respectful.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.830
But then, you've got this whole
class of applications

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.240
like podcast players.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.510
And people watch the news on,
say, BBC News, and want to go

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.430
off and do other things.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.295
And we can let that happen.

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:32.930
I think the interesting thing
to know is in theory, what

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.700
should happen is if another
action interrupts this,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.930
whether a user gets a phone--

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.150
say a user, you know, a person--
they get the phone

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.160
call while this is happening.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.410
The music stops playing, and
the audio stops playing.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.450
And I don't believe
it resumes.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.550
So it's just stopped.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.560
But that's cool.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.660
That's way more further than
we've been in the past.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.110
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.330
Cool.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.850
So the next one is CSS Calc.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.660
And I'll bring this one up.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.900
And Paul, do you want to talk
a little bit about this one?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.600
So I'll open the page.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.180
And we've got this guy
showing right now.

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.230
PAUL KINLAN: I'm hoping it's
the correct version.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.330
Because I found a bug just
before we started.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.600
PETE LEPAGE: It's version two.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.360
PAUL KINLAN: Then we
should be good.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.900
But basically, what CSS Calc is
is this ability to perform

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.630
basic calculations inside CSS.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.030
So for instance, you
could say well, my

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.280
width is normally 50%.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.725
But I want it to be an
extra 10 pixels.

00:12:24.725 --> 00:12:28.080
Well, you could never really
do that in CSS at the time.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.730
You couldn't combine
calculations together.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.790
Well, you can now.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.750
And it's been in Chrome
25 for a while.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.050
I believe in M 26, at least at
the moment, it's on prefix.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.250
But right now, on the Android
browser, which was the bug I

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.840
found earlier on, it's prefixed
with hyphen calc.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.700
The rest of the

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.430
functionality's exactly the same.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.270
But it lets you do those little
things like, I want to

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.160
add 30 pixels to two EMs.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.520
I want to do 50% minus 55%.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.160
You can even do those types
of things to keep

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.410
the units the same.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.015
It just gives you a lot more
flexibility when you're

00:13:02.015 --> 00:13:02.980
designing your layouts.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.670
And it's actually there now
inside everyone's latest

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.657
stable Chrome.

00:13:06.657 --> 00:13:08.490
So that's pretty good.

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.770
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.830
The coolest thing to me about
this is being able to go and

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:18.670
use different values or
different formats.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.390
It's just always been one of
those things where you're

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.750
like, oh crap, I
did it in this.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.810
And now I need to do--

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.910
and now you can do this
much more easily.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.340
So bringing Chrome for Android
really closer to parity with

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.650
desktop is a really big
theme of this launch.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.680
One of the next ones is support
for shadow DOM.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.130
So I'll bring up
this demo here.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.910
And I think this one's
kind of cool.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.180
And we'll take a look
at the source for

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.450
this in a couple minutes.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.990
But Paul, do you want to just
sort of explain again what's

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.800
going on on this one?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.240
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.125
So I find it awkward to explain

00:13:56.125 --> 00:13:57.330
the shadow DOM sometimes.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.272
But in this demo, at least,
anyway, it's a picture of a

00:13:59.272 --> 00:14:01.840
badge that says,
my name is Bob.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.860
And when you look at the HTML,
you'll probably see the fact

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.890
that you'll just see this
element, which is just the

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.430
basic element.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.810
There's basically a div inside
there which says, Bob.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.410
It doesn't say anything else.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.460
It just says, Bob.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.960
But we've got this big rendering
on the outside of

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.610
the badge, and some
other text, and a

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.470
lot of other things.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.380
And essentially, what's been
enabled in M 25 is the ability

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.530
to create a shadow root.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.340
And the shadow root is this
entry point into this DOM that

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:29.050
you never see as a web developer
when you look at the

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.620
view source.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.090
You have to enable shadow DOM
inspection inside the

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.780
developer tools.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.360
But you don't actually see it.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.820
And the idea is that, well,
you might have these third

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.800
party controls or these extra
controls for your user

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.120
interface elements.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.370
And all you really want to see
in your HTML is the fact that

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.310
you know that you've got
that thing in there.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.670
And that's what it's
basically doing.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.690
It's created via some JavaScript
at the moment.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.390
So you get a reference to the
element that you want to

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.250
enhance, say to create
a shadow root.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:58.340
And that's it.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.210
You basically can start
re-projecting the content from

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.690
the shadow root onto the
actual main DOM itself.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.340
It's pretty nebulous at the
moment, in my understanding,

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.710
and especially the demo.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:09.590
You can't really see much.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.035
I know when we show you the
code, hopefully it will become

00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:13.180
a lot clearer.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.135
But it basically allows you
to make components.

00:15:15.135 --> 00:15:17.560
You've got the template tag in
there as well, which is kind

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:18.565
of interesting.

00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:20.810
But yeah, you can start to build
these nice components.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.620
But the user face in HTML--

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.860
is that a way of saying it?--
is a lot simpler.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.080
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.210
I think the thing that is really
going to be interesting

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.990
about this is that the ability
to be able to build

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:34.630
components.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:39.570
So today, you can go to jQuery
UI, or you can use things like

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.360
Bootstrap, that kind of stuff.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.780
And it gives you a set
of components.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.370
But you usually have to wrap
HTML and HTML to get a bunch

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.660
of things to happen.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.070
And it works, and it's
a perfectly good

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.200
way of doing things.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.260
But wouldn't it be great to be
able to say, calendar control.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.230
And it goes and puts the right
calendar in, and you can style

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.260
it all appropriately.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.120
You get the things
that you want.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.550
And that's where I think the
shadow DOM is really going to

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:09.090
become a really powerful
and interesting piece.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:09.465
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:16:09.465 --> 00:16:12.910
Like I said, it's
a bit powerful.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.780
You might not start to use
it for a little while.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.350
But the fact is, it's consistent
across Chrome now.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.250
And it's there across all
of our instances.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.620
Not like our version of Chrome
that you get from all the

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.780
places that you normally get
them, whether it's the store,

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.720
or whether it's from the web or
the normal desktop version,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.160
then you will have shadow
DOM enabled.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.260
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.840
And this is something that's
coming to other

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.620
browsers, as well.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.900
This is not just a
Chrome feature.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.080
These are open web platform
features, right?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.740
Yeah.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.350
PAUL KINLAN: It's cool.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.180
PETE LEPAGE: And that's
something, as well, that's

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:40.910
also pretty cool.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.960
So yeah, right now,
it's just here.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.720
But it's coming to
other browsers.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.460
You'll be able to use this
in other places, as well.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.410
Awesome, all right.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.780
So let's get out of here.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.450
So we'll close this guy,
and have a look

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.850
at the iUser timings.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.810
Now, with desktop browsers,
we've been able to go and get

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:06.329
user timings for quite
some time.

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.060
And it's pretty powerful to be
able to understand how many

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.319
milliseconds it's taking for
your navigations to happen,

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.980
for your pages to load, so you
can really understand where

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.510
the bottlenecks are.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.359
And now in Chrome for Android
in the latest

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.900
release, we have that.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.349
So we can go and see, OK, well,
so in this particular

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.109
instance, our navigation
started at--

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.470
I'm not even going to try
and read that number.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.450
It looks like we have
an undefined for

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.410
our navigation end.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.610
So that may just be
a bug in the code.

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.910
PAUL KINLAN: There's
actually a few of

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.880
the standard elements.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.510
Basically, when I built
the sample, I took

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.500
everything from the spec.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.400
And then there's some across
different browsers which

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.160
aren't quite implemented, which

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.280
is why you get undefined.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.270
But there's the whole load
of navigation stuff.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.070
I think there's some DMS
ones in there, as well.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.120
This is information
that you never get

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.130
outside of dev tools.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.450
But you might want an instrument
inside your

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.410
application.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.680
Like, I've not seen anyone do it
just yet, but I would like

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.080
to see people starting to pipe
their representation lists

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.710
into Google Analytics.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.120
So that they can kind of start
to see different response

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.860
times, and how fast things
are, how that materially

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.595
affects the users,
essentially.

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:19.640
And that's what this
enables on desktop.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.280
It's now on mobile.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.640
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.530
And I think one of the other
things that, this is really

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.360
important on mobile.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.460
Because mobile performance is
completely different in many

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.710
ways than desktop
web performance.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.710
Because you're going over a 3G
or a 4G radio, or sometimes

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:42.440
even Edge or GPRS, your
performance's characteristics

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.240
are going to be significantly
different.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.200
So to understand how you
can make sure that your

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.140
performance on your mobile
website and your mobile web

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.930
apps is optimized, this is a
really good tool for being

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:59.350
able to dig into those and
see what's going on.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.140
All right.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.540
So support for the
track element.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.110
Let's go for that one.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.880
This one I think is
kind of cool.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.980
And if you're familiar with the
track element, the track

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.430
element allows you to
add captioning or

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.330
text tracks to videos.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.700
So if you were watching this
video after the fact, and you

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.690
see the numbers of the text
that's showing up, it would

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.790
show up below.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.310
So in this case, I'm going
to go hit play on

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.750
this particular video.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.710
And we'll scroll down
here in a sec.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:35.110
And you can see that below,
we've got the text is showing

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.890
up below the video.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.820
And we also have the video
playing quite nicely, as well.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:46.200
You can see the little CC
icon there, as well.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.840
Paul, do you have anything you
want to add for this one?

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.330
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, actually,
this is kind of

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.010
interesting, this one.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.860
This is a demo made by
Sam Dutton, one of my

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.270
colleagues in the UK.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.470
And basically, he's
really into media.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.380
And he's been all over
the track element for

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.510
quite a while now.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.320
But the interesting thing about
this is there's actually

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.325
a book in what we know as Chrome
for Android 25, which

00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:07.450
is this version.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.600
Where if you look at the video,
you'll probably see

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.020
black lines across the very
bottom of the video.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.880
That's actually the text track
apparently where it's been

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.220
made a little bit too small.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:19.990
So this is it.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.600
So what happens is underneath,
where you actually see the

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.820
text, and it says--

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:27.720
I'm a little bit delayed, but
I can see it says under what

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.150
happens, if there was change,
and all that type of stuff.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.050
That's actually triggered by the
events from the track API.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:35.180
So the track API is firing
events when the new captions

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.370
should come in, and all
this type of stuff.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.480
And then Sam is basically
looking at what that DOM

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.010
element is, re-projecting it
onto the page as the timing

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.000
changes, basically.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.440
So it's a little
bit of a hack.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.335
But the fact is that you get
this information out anyway,

00:20:50.335 --> 00:20:52.810
so you can go and do whatever
you want with the different

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.810
types of track information.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.250
So it's pretty cool.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.960
I expect that'll probably be
fixed at some point soon.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.440
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.250
Well, I'm going to switch
out the phone,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.490
and plug in my laptop.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.540
Paul, do you want to talk about
some of the changes to

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.160
the viewport so that I
can set up and show

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.910
some of the dev tools?

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.160
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.055
So the viewport, it's never
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:16.055 --> 00:21:18.838
But there's been some changes,
essentially with the way that

00:21:18.838 --> 00:21:23.550
we handle viewport in the last
couple of weeks, at least.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.010
And the change is the difference
between the old

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.600
Android browser and then the
Chrome browser on Android.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.340
And basically, there's an
attribute when you're actually

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:38.470
setting up your viewport where
you set user scale.

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.810
Like min scale, max scale, the
width of the viewport, whether

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.290
it matches the device script,
or it's something else.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:47.355
And then there's one extra
tag which is I

00:21:47.355 --> 00:21:48.780
think target density.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.830
And you can basically say target
density equals device

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.590
density DPI, or something
similar to that.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.340
We've detected quite a few sites
that actually exist out

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.780
there with this set.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.940
It doesn't do anything
anymore.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:00.970
It's been removed.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.080
Basically, no other browser
supports it anymore.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.350
Because we have better ways of
actually detecting the users',

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.050
essentially the users' DPI,
which you can do via

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.540
JavaScript and CSS itself,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.330
in a media inquiry.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.410
So it's been removed.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.380
If you've got it, you
can remove it.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:17.990
It's safe to remove it.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.620
Don't worry about it so much.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.984
And that's pretty much it.

00:22:22.984 --> 00:22:24.234
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:26.720
That's a big one.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.850
There's a blog post that we just
put up, recommending that

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.170
people stop using that.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.200
If you haven't gone and tested
your site, you should go and

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.150
just do a quick run through
of your site.

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.010
Just to make sure that it is
working as you expect it to

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.030
work in this new way.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:49.070
Because we found a few
particular sites where it just

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.470
doesn't work as expected.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:55.020
PAUL KINLAN: Did we do content
security policy?

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.100
PETE LEPAGE: We didn't talk
about content security policy.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.860
Go for it.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.150
PAUL KINLAN: Do we got a couple
of seconds to do that?

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.000
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.430
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, OK.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.115
So content security policy is
enabled in M 25 in Chrome,

00:23:06.115 --> 00:23:09.820
which means enabled in M 25 for
Android Chrome, as well.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.400
And basically, if you've ever
watched any of the Chrome apps

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.220
Hangouts that me and [INAUDIBLE]
do, you'll see us

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.960
talk about content security
policy all the time.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.590
So you're probably OK
with this, right?

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:22.433
But for everyone else who
hasn't heard of content

00:23:22.433 --> 00:23:24.360
security policy, it basically--
it's a set of

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.050
directives that you can include
in your HTTP headers

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.950
on the response back that
indicate essentially what type

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:33.730
of domains that requests can
come from from the site.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.570
It's essentially there to
mitigate cross site scripting.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.960
So you can basically say,
I don't allow scripts--

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.700
I only want to allow scripts
from my domain.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.600
I don't want to allow scripts
from any other site.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.780
And I don't want
to allow eval.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.140
I don't want to allow
new function.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.260
I don't want to allow any
inline script, as well.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.340
Because inline script's
an interesting one.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.950
If someone can inject a script
tag into your page, well, they

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.490
can cross site script
your page.

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.570
And the idea behind content
security policy is you can

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:58.710
actually turn that
feature off.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.760
So you can say, people can't--

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.970
basically, they might be able
to insert a script.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.560
But they can't insert any old
piece of JavaScript that they

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.510
choose to execute themselves.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.215
So you can do those types things
of things, as well.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:11.190
And that's there.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.060
It's available.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.800
And if you want to speak to
Mike West, one of our

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.390
colleagues based in Germany, in
Munich, he would be telling

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.830
you to turn it on now.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.010
I think that's really
good advice.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.730
He'd also tell you to
learn HTTPS, which

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.210
again, you should do.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.520
But you combine these two pieces
of technology together,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.700
and we start to get
more secure sites.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.500
We mitigate a lot of risks by
having these things enabled.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.260
But it requires browser support,
and it's in the

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.990
browser now.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.500
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.600
Yeah, that's a really
good point.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.870
All right, well, I've got the
remote debugger set up.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.170
So you should be able
to see that.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.810
I also want to point
out, if we could

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.880
put the link to questions.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.280
If you have questions as we're
going through, we'd love to

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.980
take your questions.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.000
So you can post your questions
there on Moderator.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.050
As soon as we finish up here on
some of the dev tool stuff,

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:00.350
we'll be popping
over to there.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.570
So post your questions
to Google Moderator.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:09.250
And I will go, and let's have
a quick peek at some of the

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.680
stuff that's available
on dev tools.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.750
So first one I want to actually
have a look at is the

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.120
shadow DOM stuff.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.700
I'm actually going to go and
we'll reload this page here,

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.050
so we can get the shadow
DOM test loaded.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.950
And if have a look at the
elements here, if I can get

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.160
this guy to load.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.415
Uh oh.

00:25:30.415 --> 00:25:36.460
I always love when the demo gods
go not so happy on you on

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.180
fun little demos.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.820
Let's see if we can
get this going.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.920
Do, do, do, do, do.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.490
I had this working
earlier today.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.880
It did work, trust me.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.030
All right.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.930
Well, let me do this.

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.180
Let me try restarting Chrome.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.655
PAUL KINLAN: I think to explain
problem for everyone

00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:58.250
who's not used dev tools,
basically the dev tools that

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.795
you see inside normal Chrome
that you connect to your web

00:26:01.795 --> 00:26:05.140
page to inspect, we have that
available in Android.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.170
And the way that you do it is
that you have to use the

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.090
Android FDK to download ADB.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:11.470
And we kind of know that's
a bit of a problem.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.860
But you have to use this tool,
ADB, which lets you forward

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.080
requests from your machine
to your USB

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.740
connected Android device.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.250
And then once you do that,
and you can actually

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.200
then use the dev tools.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.170
Because dev tools, if you don't
remember, this is on

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.640
Android, it's pretty much the
same version of Chrome.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.770
So it has the same kind of dev
tools experiments, same type

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.640
of kit and everything
inside dev tools.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.010
You connect to that, and then
you get that whole ability

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.010
from the client, which is your
main machine's connected to

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.620
your mobile phone with
the dev tools.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.740
And because they're the same,
the dev tools are actually

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.390
served up by the phone, and not
necessarily Chrome itself,

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:47.750
you get all the latest
improvements.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.580
So if you're on M 18, which is
the last version for Android,

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.100
you'd have the M 18 dev tools.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.140
Been a lot of improvements in
between, including a lot of

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.470
profiling changes.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.930
So you'll basically see
these come up now.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.200
And you've got the ability to
connect, use the dev tools

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.370
that's on the machine.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:04.910
And you get a lot of goodness
out of it, including

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.410
performance profile,
DOM inspection, all

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.880
that type of magic.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.130
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:13.390
A reload helped.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:18.290
So if we have a quick peek at
the one where we were talking

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.960
about the shadow DOM, you can
see I've got this template ID

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.450
equals name tag template.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:28.450
And if I expand this out, I've
got all of the details that

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:28.980
are in there.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.370
Now, I think in my particular
case, I'm going to bring up

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.700
the settings, so that I can see
what's in my particular

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.630
settings, I've got the show
shadow DOM turned on.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:44.150
Let me turn that off,
and reload this page

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.761
so that we can see--

00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:47.790
oh, it's still there.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.470
All right, never mind.

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.660
So with that, you can go in and
be able to dig into the

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.500
shadow DOM.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.830
You can be able to go and
see the different

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:58.400
elements that are there.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.370
You can see all of the
other additional

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.800
settings that are available.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.650
So if we have a look at some
of the new stuff that's

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.580
available within the settings,
there's now the show shadow

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.640
DOM, so that we can go in and
see what's going on there.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.250
There's also these two
rendering, show paint

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.790
rectangles and show FPS meter.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.970
So if I turn on the show FPS
meter, we all of a sudden get

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.400
the ability to see the number
of frames per second that's

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.390
being rendered on my device.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.280
So I can see that right now,
this is rendering at about 60

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.790
frames per second.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.410
Not like there's a whole heck
of a lot happening.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.610
So not a big deal.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.080
And we can also turn on
the paint rectangles.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.080
So as we go through and try
and change things on this

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.170
particular page, we
can see where

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.210
things are getting painted.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.650
Now, this is not exactly the
best example of this.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:49.440
Because there's not a lot
on this particular page.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.470
But you get the idea that you
can see as things are getting

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:58.310
repainted, where that painting
is truly happening.

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.810
The ability for source maps is
in there, just as you would

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.260
expect, as is on the desktop.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.720
As well, we can show the CPU
activity on the ruler.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.760
If I pop over to some of the
overrides, let me make this a

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.440
little bit bigger so we can see
it, you can override the

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.200
user agent.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.830
So if you want to fake out
Chrome for Android and make

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:22.180
the website think that it's
running something else, maybe

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.490
you want to see how a website
is serving different content

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:30.390
for an iOS device versus a
Chrome device, you can go in,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.730
and you can change that.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:32.900
You can also--

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.000
go ahead.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.130
PAUL KINLAN: I was going
to say, you just hit

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:35.720
the nail on the head.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.010
It's like, we've been doing a
lot of work with trying to see

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.000
which sites do what.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.890
And there are still sites that
try, basically, they'll

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.450
specialize for iOS or specialize
for Android.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.145
Because they think iOS
has got a feature.

00:29:46.145 --> 00:29:49.770
And then they'll override a
feature that is already

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.410
implemented in Chrome for
Android, essentially.

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.415
And if you change the user
agent, you can kind of test to

00:29:54.415 --> 00:29:57.300
see whether the iPhone version
essentially works better.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.920
Then you'll kind of know
whether they do

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.070
that type of thing.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.080
It's nice.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.210
PETE LEPAGE: In fact, this
is a really good example.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:05.480
One of the things that we found
when we were looking at

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.390
the viewport settings was that
a lot of sites who were using

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:14.710
the device density DPI attribute
in their viewport,

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.790
they would use it only on
Chrome or on Android.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.670
But they wouldn't send
it to iOS devices.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.290
So one of the ways that I was
able to test and figure out

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:27.580
oh, hang on, what's the best fix
for some of these sites?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.310
Was by going and changing the
user agent to iOS and being

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.100
like hey, just give us this.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.920
It works perfectly.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.300
And that was a really
easy fix for them.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.400
You can also go in and override
your geolocation

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.210
settings, the device
orientation.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.050
Emulate touch events, that one's
kind of one of those

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.740
things that's in there because
it's available on the desktop.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.160
And you don't really need to
emulate them on the mobile

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.160
device, but it's there anyway.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:03.628
And you can also emulate some
of the CSS properties.

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:05.470
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:06.790
I really like dev tools.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.280
I'm hoping that we
get [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.740
mobile specific dev
tools session.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.090
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.060
I think that's a really
valuable thing.

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.350
And we'll try and get them on
within the next couple weeks.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.720
Because there's a lot of new
stuff available, and I think a

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.350
lot of really interesting and
powerful things available for

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.610
us as developers.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.170
So that's sort of the end of
the stuff that I wanted to

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.450
show really quickly
in the dev tools.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.140
Paul, was there anything
else that you think

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.867
is worthy of a highlight?

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:37.640
PAUL KINLAN: Dev
tools wise, or?

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.250
PETE LEPAGE: Dev tools, or
actually anything else,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.400
because I think at this point,
we've covered most of the

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.660
stuff that we wanted to.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.600
PAUL KINLAN: I think there's a
lot of stuff under the hood

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.880
just infiltrating.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.410
[INAUDIBLE] compositor,
it's a big change.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.280
Basically, you'll see the
difference when you scroll

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.170
through any site.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.110
Because you'll see the
content still.

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.780
So at the same time, we want a
lot of feedback about your

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.140
experiences with the
developer tools, or

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.120
with the latest version.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.070
Especially if you're a
developer, and you found

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.960
something that doesn't work
quite as you'd expect.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.210
[INAUDIBLE].

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.170
So yeah, send us all the
reports you want.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:19.490
Also, send us feedback
on what you want to

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.330
hear about, as well.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.710
Because we have some ideas,
but obviously, we want you

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.000
guys to learn things from what
we're talking about.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.630
And we're not going to
do a what's new in

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.830
Android every week.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.290
PETE LEPAGE: We don't ship
every week, yeah.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:34.910
PAUL KINLAN: Exactly right.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.190
But at the same time, there's
going to be a

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.140
lot of stuff coming.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.526
And we're going to have a whole
lot of new features to

00:32:41.526 --> 00:32:43.095
talk to you about.

00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:44.900
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
a really great point.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.530
With Chrome for Android, you can
run Chrome Beta and Chrome

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.660
Stable side by side.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.920
You can't do that
on the desktop.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.860
And so if you want to see what's
coming, you want to

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.490
play with some of those things,
that's a really great

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.900
way to see what's coming,
and just sort

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.666
of see what's exciting.

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:05.530
PAUL KINLAN: Actually, one thing
I did want to talk about

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:09.460
is that I think in this one,
you can use about flags.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.960
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, that, yes!

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.080
PAUL KINLAN: You've got the
ability now in stable Chrome

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.080
to be able to toggle all
of these settings.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.460
One, especially if you're a
games developer and you want

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:23.790
to do WebGL on mobile, and
pretty much Firefox is the

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.650
only option, you could enable
that and test it inside your

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.160
browser now.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.440
It's not available on
the general web.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.670
It has to be enabled
by a Chrome flags.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.560
But things like WebGL,
especially, these are the

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.062
technologies which we want to
get out there, but we don't

00:33:37.062 --> 00:33:39.400
think are quite ready
just yet.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.402
We'd love feedback on all these
other features, as well.

00:33:42.402 --> 00:33:45.870
Or you've got uses for
them, at least.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:49.280
Chrome flags, interestingly,
all the normal Chrome colon

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.990
slash slash URLs would work.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.180
So if you want to go and check
what appcache is doing, Chrome

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.870
colon slash slash appcache
internals, those types of

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.102
things, you get the full
accessible of what you need on

00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:03.274
the device.

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:06.150
And you don't have to enable
developer [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.930
PETE LEPAGE: That's
pretty slick.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:08.300
Cool.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.820
Well, why don't we switch
over and take

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.100
some of your questions.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.170
I'm going to bring this up.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:18.230
And if you guys have questions
that you want to post, please

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.199
feel free to post those
to the Moderator.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.159
We'll put the link up there.

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:24.820
And let me load questions.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.150
Maybe it's slow internet
day here at Google.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.670
PAUL KINLAN: I've got the
questions, if you want.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.530
PETE LEPAGE: OK yeah, why
don't we just switch

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:32.330
to the two of us.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.130
And you can go for questions,
and we can

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:34.940
take them from there.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.710
PAUL KINLAN: We've got
two questions.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:39.734
The first one is, any plans to
make available camera capture

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:45.105
via getUserMedia and WebRTC
in Chrome for Android?

00:34:45.105 --> 00:34:46.020
Pete?

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:48.110
PETE LEPAGE: Sure, absolutely.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.219
I want to answer this question
a little bit more generally.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.469
Because I think it's a little
bit more fun to do that.

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.820
And it gives you a little
bit more excitement

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.320
about what's coming.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:03.220
The plan is to really get
desktop and phone parity.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.730
So we want to make sure that
the same features that are

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.420
available for Chrome for
desktop are available.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.960
Now, it may take
a little while.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.820
And some of these things, you
may see behind flags.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.280
But we do plan to get everything
as close to feature

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.600
parity as possible.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.470
In fact, that's one you
can check out today.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.750
If you go into Chrome
colon [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:32.100
flags, you can turn WebGL on in
Chrome M 25, which you can

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.100
see, these are things that
are moving forward.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.590
It is behind a flag right now,
so that we can make sure that

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.310
we get it right.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:43.590
We can not have somebody go
do something, it's like

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.900
absolutely beautiful but kind
of slow, or has a bad

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.410
experience.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:51.390
We want to make sure that we
provide that great experience.

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.030
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.900
Parity's our thing.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.070
We're not saying that we're
completely there just yet.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.770
But we've come a long,
long way in a

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:01.550
relatively short time.

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.920
So I'm hopeful.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.770
The interesting thing, if you
want to access the camera,

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.970
there's always the import
type you [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.390
accepts camera, or accepts
image type.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.650
And then capture camera
and capture camcorder.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.290
It'll let you do
video, as well.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.580
So you do have access to them.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.810
And they're still in there.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.200
It's not as nice, obviously.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.930
It's not as sexy.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.320
It's not as inline
as you expect.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.020
Everyone wants that Instagram
experience.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.770
I mean, we do have a basic
solution in lieu of that.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:33.390
Watch the space for all
the other features.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:36.640
We want parity.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.570
Second question is
about extensions.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:39.795
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, yeah.

00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:43.040
PAUL KINLAN: Are we bringing
extensions anytime soon?

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.860
PETE LEPAGE: I don't think we
have anything to announce at

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.080
this point.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.470
I know it's something that we're
certainly interested in.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.060
The biggest concern that I
have around extensions is

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.040
really around performance and
accessibility on stuff.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.180
On a desktop where you can have
all sorts of little icons

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.710
next to your address bar, where
you can take a little

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.780
bit of a performance hit,
because you're doing some

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.700
JavaScript processing.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.620
Or maybe you're going and
pulling some additional

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.020
resources, and putting
them on a page.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.060
That's OK, because you've
got a powerful computer.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.390
On a phone or tablet, you
don't have that much

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.220
processing power.

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.470
So I think it's really important
that when we do

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.950
tackle this, we make sure
we tackle it right.

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.770
And we don't end up doing
anything that's going to cause

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.740
performance implications
for users.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.960
Cool.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:38.540
PAUL KINLAN: That's it.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.280
I think that's all
the questions.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.500
There's none on YouTube.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.680
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:44.000
PAUL KINLAN: So yeah,
I think we're--

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.970
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.820
I want to say thanks everybody
for joining us.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.330
Thanks, Paul, for joining
us from London.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.250
We're going to be doing
this every Thursday.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.250
So we'll be back next Thursday
at the same time.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.970
And hope to see you then.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:37:59.220
Thanks, everybody.
