00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.780
MATT FROST: Welcome to the first
session on WebM and the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.230
New VP9 Open Video Codec.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.890
We figured that there's no way
to really add a little

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.380
excitement to a presentation
than to change it at the last

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.720
minute, and so what we've spent
this morning doing is

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.970
encoding some VP9 video and
H.264 video and putting

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.650
together a side by side
demonstration just to give you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.920
a taste of what we're
working on.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.690
So what you're going
to see is a video.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.820
The video is going to be the
same on either side.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.280
It's going to be VP9, the
new codec on the left,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310
H.264 on the right.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:45.270
And H.264, we used the X264 open
video encoder, which is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.780
commonly regarded as the
best encoder out there.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.420
We used the highest
possible settings.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.900
So we've done everything we
can to favor H.264 here.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.560
All of this is at the same
data rate, so both of the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.390
videos are going to be at
the same data rate.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.410
And the bit rate varies.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.900
In some cases, we're
using 500K.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.300
In other cases, we've dropped
the bit rate down to bit rates

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.760
that are actually banned by
certain UN conventions for the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.480
compression of HD video.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.300
And so with that, I think that's
everything, Ronald?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.070
RONALD BULTJE: Yes.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.230
So like Matt said, what you're
looking at here is shots that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.080
we just took this morning.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.870
We've encoded those in just a
couple of hours and basically,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.580
what you're looking at here,
on the left, VP9 and on the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.380
right, H.264, is what an amazing
job we can actually do

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.220
at video compression if we're
using the very latest

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.470
technologies.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.150
MATT FROST: So you can see the
blockiness on the right.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.740
On some of this, it's a lot more
evident than others, and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.950
especially evident, if you want
afterwards to come up and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.470
take a look at this running
on the screen,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.460
we can freeze frames.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.970
But you see there on the right
especially, all this

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.910
blockiness and how much
it clears up as it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.664
moves into VP9 territory.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.300
RONALD BULTJE: And a point here
really is that for high

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.650
definition video, H.264 can do
a reasonable job, but we can

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.370
do a lot better than that.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.910
And so having said that, let's
actually get started on the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.160
presentation.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.270
MATT FROST: So the way that
we're going to handle this

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.420
presentation is I'm going to do
a quick introduction on why

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.380
we care about open video,
both why does Google--

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.690
which has historically been
involved with developing

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.240
applications around video--

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.360
has gotten down deeply into
actually helping work on these

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.720
next generation compression
technologies.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.270
After we talk about that and
why, in general, improving

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.720
video compression is good for
everybody, I'm going to turn

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.890
it over to Ronald for really the
meat of this presentation,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.220
which will be to show you some
more demonstrations, to talk a

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.410
little bit about how we measure
video quality, talk

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.710
about some of the techniques
that we're exploiting to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.470
really make this dramatic
improvement in compression.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.920
And then finally, after you've
seen this, and I hope that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.200
you've started to get a little
excited about what this

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.210
technology can do for you, we'll
go and talk about the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.910
last stages, how we're going
to wrap up this project and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.460
how we're going to get these
tools into your hands as

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.870
quickly as possible.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.600
So to start off with, just
taking a quick look at how

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.160
Google got into video.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.430
Video at Google started in the
same way that so many big

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.940
projects at Google start,
as an experiment.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.390
And we launched these efforts
with just a single full time

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.520
engineer and a number of
engineers working 20% of their

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.320
time on video, really focusing
on video-related data.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.420
And then over the last 10 years,
obviously, video at

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.140
Google has exploded, not only
with YouTube but with Google

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.090
Talk, Hangouts, lots of
applications where you

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.960
wouldn't necessarily think of
video as playing a core role,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.690
like Chromoting, which is Chrome
Remote Desktopping.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.110
But if you look at the really
motivating factors for getting

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.950
into video compression, there
are a couple that

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.010
are really of note.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.570
One, of course, is the
acquisition of YouTube.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.090
And with the acquisition of
YouTube, we all of a sudden

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.560
started to focus very heavily
on both improving the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.610
experience for users, improving
video quality, but

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.110
also about the costs associated
with all aspects of

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.740
running a service
like YouTube.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.090
There are costs associated
with ingest, transcode of

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.360
video formats, storage of
multiple different formats,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.450
and then distribution of the
video, both to caches and to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.170
the edge, and ultimately
to users.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.080
The second was the move from
HTML4 to HTML5, which came at

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.410
the same time, pretty much,
as our launch of Chrome.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.800
And of course, in HTML4,
although to the user, it

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.530
appeared that video could be
supported in a browser, in

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.310
fact, video was supported
through runtimes and plug-ins.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.220
With HTML5, video becomes a
native part of the browser.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.470
And so with the move towards
HTML5, we see it filtering

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.400
through the addition of the
video tag in Chrome and the

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.070
launch of HTML5 video
for YouTube.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.620
So these are the two factors--

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.200
the focus on quality and
reducing cost with YouTube,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.470
the need to build a high quality
codec into Chrome and

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.010
other browsers for
the video tag--

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.320
that sparked the acquisition in
2010 of On2 Technologies,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.250
the company that I came from and
many members of the WebM

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.075
team came from, and the launch
of the WebM project.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.780
The WebM project is an effort
to develop a high quality,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.810
open alternative
for web video.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.550
We're very focused on web
video, not on video for

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.190
Blu-ray discs, not on video
for cable television, but

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.080
about solving the problems that
we find in web video.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.600
In addition, we're very focused
on having an open

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.050
standard because we believe that
the web has evolved as

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.690
quickly is it has because it is
based on open technologies.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.240
And clearly, multimedia
communication has become such

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.910
a core part of how we
communicate on the web that we

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.380
need open technologies that are
rapidly evolving to allow

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.250
us to keep pace and to make sure
that we can develop the

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.470
next generation of killer
video applications.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.240
We wanted something
simple as well.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.180
So we used the VP8 Open Codec,
the Vorbis Open Audio Codec,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.850
which was a long existing open
audio codec, and then them the

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.960
Matroska File Wrapper.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.400
With the launch of VP9 in a
matter of months, we're going

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.080
to be adding the VP9 Video Codec
as well as the brand new

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.190
Opus Audio Codec, which is
another open audio codec, very

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.690
performant and high quality.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.220
So since our launch, obviously,
web video has

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.410
continued to grow.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.500
And if we just look at what we
know very well, which is

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.600
YouTube, YouTube has grown to
be a global scale video

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.470
platform capable of serving
video across the globe to

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.470
these myriad connected
video enabled devices

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.030
that we're all using.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.150
It supports a billion monthly
users, and those users are

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.890
looking at video four billion
times a day for a total of six

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.830
billion plus hours of video
viewed monthly.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.060
Just to think about that number,
that is an hour of

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.780
video for every person on the
planet consumed on YouTube.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.920
And on the creation
side, we're seeing

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.880
exactly the same trends.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.870
72 hours of video is uploaded
per minute, and that video is

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.270
increasingly becoming
HD video.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.930
So if you look at the graph
on the right, blue is 360p

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.750
standard definition video, which
is slowly declining, but

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.080
quickly being matched by
uploads of HD video.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.990
And the key here of great
importance is that HD video is

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.650
obviously more complex.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.990
There's more data for a given
HD video than there is for--

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.150
unless, of course, you're
encoding it in VP9--

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.700
than there is for a standard
resolution video.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.690
In addition, I think we can all
agree that the better the

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.480
video is, the higher the
resolution, the more

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.020
watchable it is.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.740
And then finally, the other
trend that's driving both

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.120
creation and consumption is the
increase in mobile devices

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.410
and the move towards
4G networks.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.470
So even this morning, there was
an article when I woke up

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.610
and was checking my email saying
that YouTube video

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:04.470
accounts for 25% of
all downstream

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.360
web traffic in Europe.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.130
And I think BitTorrent
accounted for 13%.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:17.500
So there alone, between just two
web video services, we're

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:23.070
looking at close to 40% of all
web data in Europe being video

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.140
related data.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.800
And that accords with what we
see from the latest Cisco

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.990
forecasts, for instance, which
is that consumer web video is

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.210
going to be close to 90% of all
consumer data on the web

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.080
within the next three years.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.130
So it's remarkably encouraging
to see the growth in video,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.690
but it also represents
a real challenge.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.530
Of course, the good news is that
we have a technology that

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.290
is up to this challenge,
and that is VP9.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.910
With next generation video
codecs, with the codecs as

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.140
good as VP9, we can effectively
significantly

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.400
increase the size of the
internet and we can

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.230
significantly increase the
speed of the internet.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.060
So obviously, if you're
taking VP9--

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.900
which, as Ronald will say,
halves the bit rate you need

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.560
for the very best H.264
to deliver a

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.200
given quality video--

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.510
you're going to be able to
speed the downloaded of a

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.650
download and play a video,
you're going to be able to

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.410
speed, obviously, the buffering
of these videos.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:31.590
So we have the tools to
effectively dramatically

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.470
increase the size
of the internet.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.250
But of course in doing that,
in improving the video

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.860
experience, in improving the
ability to upload video

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:44.170
quickly, we're going to just
create the conditions for even

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.740
more consumption of video.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.700
And so it's not going to be
enough for us to rest on our

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.170
laurels with VP9.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.190
We're going to have to turn to
VP9 and keep on doing it, keep

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.300
on pushing the boundaries of
what we're capable of with

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.770
video compression.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.740
So with that, I'm going to turn
it over to Ronald to show

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.720
you some really remarkable
demonstrations of this new

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.350
technology.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.600
RONALD BULTJE: Thank you.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.410
So to get started, I just
briefly want to say some words

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.660
about video quality.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.940
So how do we measure quality?

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.470
Well, the most typical way to
measure quality is to just

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.090
look at it, because at the end
of the day, the only thing

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.440
that we care about is that the
video that you're looking at

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.060
looks great to your eyes.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.650
But that's, of course, not all
there is to it because as

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.450
we're developing a new video
codec, we cannot spend our

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.450
whole day just watching YouTube
videos over and over

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.190
and over again.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.250
That would be fun, though.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.210
So in addition to visually
analyzing and inspecting

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.770
video, we're also
using metrics.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.950
The most popular metric in the
field for measuring video

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.110
quality is called PSNR.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.390
It stands for Peak Square
Noise Ratio.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.860
And the graph that you're
looking at here on the left is

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.540
a typical representation of PSNR
on the vertical axis and

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.410
video bit rate on the horizontal
axis to give you

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:20.430
some sort of a feeling of
how those two relate.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.530
So the obvious thing to note
here is that as you increase

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:28.530
the bit rate, the video quality,
as measured by this

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.730
metric, increases.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.410
So at the end of the day what
that means is that it doesn't

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.280
really matter what code you
use, as long as you've

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.860
infinite bandwidth, you can
accomplish any quality.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.860
However, our goal is to make
it easier and faster and

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.560
simpler to stream video.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.220
So how does PSNR actually
compare to visual quality?

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.260
So for that, there's
a sample clip.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.130
So what you're looking here is
a very high penalty shot of

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.550
the New York skyline.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.410
I believe that this is the
Empire State Building.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:07.410
And this clip has a lot of
detailed textures all across.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.340
So what we've done here is
that we've encoded it at

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.750
various bit rates, and then
every couple of seconds, we're

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.500
dropping the bit rate and the
metric quality of the video

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.870
will slowly decrease.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.880
So this is 45 dB, and what
you're seeing slowly at 30 dB

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.460
is that some of the detail, or
actually a lot of the detail,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.910
in the backgrounds of the
buildings just completely

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.100
disappears.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:34.270
And that was the case at
35 dB already also.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.430
As you go to 25 dB, you can
see-- we can go really low in

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.390
quality, but you do not
want to watch this.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.740
Here's a different scene.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.280
Same thing, we start with
the original 45 dB.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.010
40 dB looks pretty good.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.570
35 dB starts having a lot of
artifacts, and then 30 and 25

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.880
are essentially unwatchable.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.180
So what does that mean
for video quality?

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:03.510
Well, the typical target quality
for high definition

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.910
video on the internet
lies rounds 40 dB.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.150
You were just looking at the
video, and a 40 dB looked

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.480
really quite good.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.130
So if you go to YouTube and
you try to stream a 720p

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.460
video, that's actually about the
quality that you will get.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.570
In terms of bit rate, what you
should expect to get is a

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.850
couple of megabits a second.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.100
For this particular clip, that's
one to two megabits a

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.010
second, but that's very source
material dependent.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.740
So what we've done, then, is we
have taken, I think, about

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:44.200
1,000 YouTube CCL licensed
uploads, just randomly

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:50.410
selected from whatever users
give us, and we've then taken

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.460
out particular material that
we're not really interested

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.200
in, such as stills or video
clips that contain garbage

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.560
video content.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.410
And then we were left with, I
think, about 700 CCL licensed

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.170
YouTube uploads, and we've
encoded those at various bit

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.680
rates-- so at various
quality settings--

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.710
with our VP9 Video Codec or
with H.264 using the X264

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:18.020
encoder at the very best
settings that we are aware of.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:25.130
Then for each of these clips,
we've taken the left half of

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.380
the resulting compressed file
and the right half of the 264

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.130
one and we've stitched those
back together, and then you

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.150
essentially get what you're
looking at here.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:39.030
So left here is VP9, right is
264, and those are at about

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.310
the same bit rate.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.180
You will see graphs here on the
left and on the right, and

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.320
those are actually the effective
bit rate for this

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.370
particular video clip.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.820
And as you can see, it starts
being about equal.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.590
Now, you saw it just jumping up,
and that's because we're

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.010
gradually increasing the bit
rate to allow the 264 encoder

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.810
to catch up in quality.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.590
And as you can see, it slowly,
slowly starts looking a little

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:03.500
bit better.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.980
And at this point, I would say
that it looks about equal on

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.260
the left and on the right.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.310
But if you look at the bit rate
graphs, you can basically

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.760
see that we're spending about
two and a half times the bit

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.170
rate on a 264 file versus
the VP9 file.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.690
So those are the compression
savings that you can get if

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.810
you do same quality encodings
but you use

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:28.430
VP9 instead of 264.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.990
So what you're looking at here
is a comparative graph for the

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.690
clip that you were
just looking at.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.770
The blue line is the 264 encoded
version and the red

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.420
line is the VP9 encoded
version.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.440
And as I said in the beginning,
vertical axis is

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.540
PSNR as a metric of
quality, and the

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.490
horizontal axis is bit rate.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.500
So the way that you compare
these is that you can pick any

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.840
point from the red line--

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.920
or from the blue line,
for that matter--

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.090
and then you can
do two things.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:02.340
Either you can draw a vertical
line and find the matching

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.130
point on a blue line that
matches the points on the red

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.010
line that you're looking for
and look at what the

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.520
difference in quality is.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.859
But what we usually do is we
do it the other way around.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.970
So we're drawing a horizontal
line for the point on the red

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.640
graph, and we're finding the
point that matches the

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.290
horizontal line on the blue.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.900
And what you're looking at here
is that for the point

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.710
that we were just looking at,
that is, a quality metric

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:32.050
point of about 37.1 dB, the VP9
version takes an average

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.050
of 328 kilobits a second to
reach that quality, and for

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.970
H.264, you need to go up to
essentially 800 kilobits a

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.820
second to get exactly
the same quality.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.620
So what that means is, again,
the metrics tell us you can

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.780
get a two and a half times lower
bit rate and effectively

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.290
get the same quality by using
VP9 instead of 264.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.510
If you look to the higher end
of the graph, you will see

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.570
that the differences in quality
for the same bit rates

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.800
might go slightly down, but
that's basically just because

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.460
at the higher end, there's
a diminishing

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.650
returns for bit rate.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.440
So if you look at the high ends
of both of those graphs

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.980
and you do the horizontal line
comparison, so what is the

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.960
different bit rate that
accomplishes the same quality?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.610
You will see that it about
comes down to 2x over the

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.860
whole graph.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.040
So let's look at the difference
video because I

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.470
could just be cheating you with
this one video and we

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.610
could have optimized our codec
for this one video.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.930
So what you're looking at here
is, again, the same thing, VP9

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.650
on the left, 264 on the right,
live bit rate graphs and we

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.360
start at the same bit rate.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.130
Then as we do that, we're slowly
increasing the bit rate

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.740
for the 264 portion video so
that it can actually catch up

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.930
in quality.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.410
And what you're looking at is
that on the right, the floor

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.430
is pulsing a lot.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.690
You can actually see, if you
focus on the pants of little

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:03.710
boy here or on the plastic box,
that it's very noisy.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.340
But eventually, it catches
up in quality.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.050
Guess what happened
to the bit rate?

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.330
It's almost 3x for this
particular video.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.000
So here is the [INAUDIBLE] graph
for the material that we

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.240
were just looking at.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.240
The red line is VP9, the
blue line is H.264.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:30.320
And if we do the same quality
different bit rate comparison

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.300
at the point that we were just
looking at, which is about

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.950
38.6 dB, for VP9, you arrive
at about 200 kilobits a

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.160
second, and for H.264, you need
to interpolate between

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.340
two points because we don't have
an exact match, and it

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.430
ends up being around 550
kilobits a second.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:54.660
So almost 3x more bit rates to
accomplish the same quality,

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.240
just because you can use
VP9 to save this.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.250
So we've done this over
many, many clips.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.010
I told you we had about 700
clips that we tested this on

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:07.440
at various bit rates and various
quality settings, and

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.800
overall, you can save 50%
bandwidth by encoding your

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:16.100
videos in VP9 instead of H.264
at the very best settings that

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.350
we are aware of.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.450
So how did we do this?

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.710
So let's look a little bit at
the techniques that we're

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.250
using to actually get to this
kind of compression

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.230
efficiency.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.500
So a typical video sequence
consists of a series of video

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.150
frames, and then each of
these video frames

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.610
consist of square blocks.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.650
So for current generation video
codecs, like H.264,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.960
these blocks have a size of
a maximum 16 by 16 pixels.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.860
We've blown this up a lot.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.830
We have currently gone up to
64 by 64 pixels for each

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.990
block, and then at that
point, we introduce a

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:58.360
partitioning step.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.610
And in this partitioning step,
we allow you to do a vertical

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.360
or horizontal partitioning,
a four-way split, or no

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.190
partitioning at all, resulting
in different size sub-blocks.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:13.380
If you do a four-way split and
you have four 32 by 32 blocks,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:16.000
then for each of these blocks,
you go through the same

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.860
process again of horizontal,
vertical split, four-way

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.300
split, or no split at all.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300
If you do the four-way split,
you get down to 16 by 16

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.200
pixels, do the same thing
again to get to eight by

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.950
eight, and eventually
four by four pixels.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.880
So what this partitioning step
allows you to do is to break

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.250
up the video in such a way that
it's optimized for your

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.660
particular content.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.270
Stuff that has a very stable
motion field can use very

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.470
large blocks, whereas video
content where things are

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:48.480
moving all across all the time,
you can go to very small

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.560
video blocks.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.130
So what do we you
do after that?

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:58.240
So after this partitioning
step, we're usually doing

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.190
motion vector coding, and
basically what that does is

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.260
that you pick a reference frame,
and you pick a motion

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.110
vector, and then the block of
that particular size that you

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.990
selected in your partitioning
step will be coded using a

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.580
motion vector pointing in one
of the previously coded

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.020
reference frames.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:19.550
These reference frames in VP8
were usually frames that had

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.950
previously been encoded, and
were therefore temporarily

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.290
before the current frame.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.670
What we've added in VP9 is that
we have multi-level alt

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.800
reference frames, and what
that allows you to do is

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:37.510
encode the video sequence in any
frame order, and then you

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:41.490
can use any future frame as a
reference frame for a frame

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.700
that you encode in order, decide
to encode after that.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.650
So for this series
of frames in the

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.990
left, this is six frames.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.390
I could, for example, choose the
first thing encode frame

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:58.250
one, then frame six, and then
frame three using both a

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.830
future as well as a
past reference.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.350
And then, now that I have
encoded three, I can encode

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.060
one and two really efficiently
because they have a very

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.010
proximate future and
past reference.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:11.800
After I've encoded two and
three, I go to five, which has

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.900
four and six as close
neighbors.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.750
And so that allows for very
temporally close reference

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.160
frames to be used as a predictor
of contents in the

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.230
current block.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:30.280
So once you have a motion
vector, you can use subpixel

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.800
filtering, and subpixel
filtering allows you to

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.560
basically pick a point in
between two full pixels and

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.580
this point in between is then
interpolated using a subpixel

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.050
interpolation filter.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.430
In VP8, we had only a single
subpixel interpolation filter.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.520
Most codecs use just a single
subpixel interpolation filter.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.190
We've actually added three in
VP9, and those are optimized

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.780
for different types
of material.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.320
We have a sharp subpixel
interpolation filter, which is

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.890
really great for material where
there's a very sharp

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.590
edge somewhere in the middle.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.490
For example, that city clip that
we were looking at in the

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.090
beginning, if you're thinking of
a block that happens to be

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.250
somewhere on the border
between the sky and a

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.800
building, we consider that a
sharp edge, and so using an

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.330
optimized filter for sharp edges
actually maintains a lot

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.950
of that detail.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:24.500
On the other hand, sometimes
there's very sharp edges but

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.350
those are not consistent across
video frames across

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:31.040
different temporal points in
the sequence that you're

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.080
looking at.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.240
And that point, this will cause
a very high frequency

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.930
residual artifact, and
so for those, we've

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.240
added a low pass filter.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.780
And what the low pass filter
does is that it basically

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.760
removes sharp edges, and it does
exactly the opposite as a

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.970
sharp filter.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.250
Lastly, we have a regular
filter, which is similar to

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.270
the one that VP8 had.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.240
After this prediction step,
you have predicted block

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.100
contents and you have the
actual block that you're

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.150
trying to get as close as
possible to, and then the

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.520
difference between these two
is the residual signal that

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.820
you're going to encode.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.480
So in current generation video
codecs, we usually use four by

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.980
four or eight by eight cosine
based transforms called DCTs

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.340
to encode this residual
signal.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.020
What we've added in VP9 is much
higher resolution DCT

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.730
transforms all the way up to
32 by 32 pixels, and in

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.710
addition to using the DCT, we've
also added an asymmetric

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.450
sine based transform
called ADST.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.480
And the sine based transform is
optimized for a signal that

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.700
has a near zero value at the
edge of the predicted region,

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.770
whereas the cosine is optimized
for a residual

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:42.190
signal that has a zero signal
in the middle of

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.620
the predicted signal.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.730
So those are optimized for
different conditions, and

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:51.680
together, they give good gains
when used properly.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.250
Basically, the take home message
from all of this is

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:59.930
that we've added big resolution
increments to our

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.940
video codecs, and what that
leads to is a codec that is

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.060
highly, highly optimized for
high definition video coding.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.460
But at the same time, because
it is very configurable, it

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.220
still performs really well at
low resolution content, for

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:19.320
example, SIF-based 320
by 240 video as well.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.410
So I'll hand it back to Matt
now, who will take over.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:28.070
MATT FROST: Thanks, Ronald.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.280
So I just want to give you a
quick recap of what we've

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.710
discussed and sort of the
highlights of this technology,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.520
and then to tell you about the
last steps that we're going

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.650
through to get VP9
in your hands.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.300
As Ronald said, we're talking
about technology here that is

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.550
50% better than literally
everything that everybody else

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.270
out there is using.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:54.410
And actually, we made a point to
say we were using the very

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:58.930
best encoder out there at the
very best settings, settings

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.670
which I really think you're not
seeing very often in the

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:06.490
real world because they're very
difficult to use in a

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.540
real world encoding
environment.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.620
So I hope that there are a
number of people in this

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.470
audience now who are out there,
either with existing

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.040
products with video or products
to which you're

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.070
looking to add video, or just
you're thinking about how you

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.580
can use these tools to launch a
new product and to come out

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.640
with a start-up.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.650
This technology has not been
used by anyone right now.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.880
YouTube is testing it and we'll
talk about that in a

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.140
little bit, but if you adopt
VP9, as you can very quickly,

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.550
you will have a tremendous
advantage over anybody out

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:40.820
there with their current
offering based

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.580
on 264 or even VP8.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:49.710
It's currently available in
Chrome, and the libvpx library

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.190
on the WebM project is out there
for you to download,

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.740
compile, and test.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.630
It's open source.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.430
You will have access
to source code.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.310
The terms of the open source
license are incredibly liberal

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.560
so that you can take the code,
improve it, optimize it,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:12.340
modify it, integrate it with
your proprietary technology,

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.760
and you're not going to have to
give back a line of code to

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.330
the project.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.620
You're not going to have to
be concerned that you will

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.060
inadvertently open source your
own proprietary code.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.140
And then finally, it's
royalty free.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.360
And obviously, this is something
that was of great

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.950
importance to us as we sought
to open source a video

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.600
technology for use in HTML5
and the video tag.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:38.490
We believe that the best is
still to come in terms of

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.660
video products on the web, and
that in order to make sure

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.690
that people are free to innovate
and that start-ups

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.820
are free to launch great new
video products, we have to

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.940
make sure that they're not
writing $5 or $6 million

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.000
checks a year to standards
bodies.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.290
We're working very hard on
putting this technology into

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.380
your hands as soon
as possible.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:05.650
We did a semi freeze of the bit
stream just a couple of

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:10.810
weeks ago, and at that time,
we said that we were taking

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.670
comments on the bit stream
for 45 more days.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.860
Specifically, we're looking for
comments from a lot of our

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.990
hardware partners to some of the
software techniques that

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.550
we're using just to make sure
that we're not doing anything

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.250
that's incredibly difficult
to implement in hardware.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.860
At the end of the 45 day period
on June 17, we're going

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:36.840
to be bit stream frozen, which
means that after June 17, any

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.920
VP9 encoder that you use is
going to be compliant with any

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.310
VP9 decoder, and that if you're
encoding content with

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:48.000
an encoder that's out after June
17, it's going to be able

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.500
to play back in a decoder after
the bit stream freeze.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.360
Obviously, getting VP9
in Chrome is very

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.470
important to us.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.690
The beta VP9 which you've
been seeing today

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:01.430
is already in Chrome.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.240
If you download the latest
development version of Chrome

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.430
and enable the VP9 experiment,
you'll be able to play back

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.150
VP9 content immediately.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.520
As soon as we've frozen the
bit stream as of June 17,

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.010
we're going to roll it into the
Dev Channel of Chrome as

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.120
well with this final version of
VP9, and then that's going

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.620
to work through the
beta channel and

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.340
through the stable channel.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.600
And by the end of the summer,
we are going to have VP9 in

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.120
stable version of Chrome rolling
out to the hundreds of

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.990
millions of users.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.630
I think [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.670
today said that there are
750 million users of

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.730
Chrome right now.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.980
VP9 is going to be deployed
on a massive scale

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.810
by the end of summer.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.160
In terms of final development
activities that we're going to

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.340
be working on, after the bit
stream is finalized in the

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.850
middle of June, we're going to
be focusing on optimizations

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.190
both for performance
and for platform.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.930
So what that means is we'll be
working on making sure that

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:04.920
they encoder is optimized for
a production environment.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.170
Obviously, something that's very
important to YouTube as

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.960
YouTube moves to supporting
VP9, that the decoder is

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.360
sufficiently fast to play
back on many of the PCs

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.990
that are out there.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.710
We're also going to be working
on platform optimizations that

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.000
will be important to Android
developers, for instance, and

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.740
to people who want to support
VP9 on embedded devices.

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.750
These are ARM optimizations and

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.880
optimizations for other DSPs.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.860
We have hardware designs
coming out.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:38.840
For those of you who may work
with semiconductor companies

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.250
or are thinking about a
technology like this for use

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:45.800
in something like an action
camera, these are hardware

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.360
designs that get integrated
into a larger design for a

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.750
semiconductor and allow for
a fully accelerated VP9

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.800
experience.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.620
Real time optimizations are
obviously incredibly important

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.870
for video conferencing, Skype
style applications, and also

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.630
for new applications that are
coming out like screencasting

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.680
and screen sharing.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:11.170
By the end of Q3, we should have
real time optimizations

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:15.190
which allow for a very good
real time performance.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.940
Those optimizations should
then allow VP9 to be

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.200
integrated into the WebRTC
project, which is a sister

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.120
project to the WebM project and
basically takes the entire

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.170
real time communication stack
and builds it into Chrome, and

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.280
more broadly into HTML5
capable browsers.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.180
And so what this means is that
when VP9 is integrated into

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.640
WebRTC, you will have tools that
are open source, free for

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.470
implementation that used to,
even four years ago, require

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.400
license fees of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.730
And you, with a few hundred
lines of JavaScript, should be

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.080
able to build the same sort of
rich video conferencing style

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.780
applications and screencasting
applications that you're

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.400
seeing with products
like Hangouts.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.890
And finally, in the end of this
year moving into Q1 2014,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.570
we're going to see,
again, hardware

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.050
designs for the encoder.

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.920
So just to give you an idea of
how usable these technologies

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:27.270
are, we have a VP9 demonstration
in YouTube.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:32.630
If you download the Development
Version of Chrome

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:37.140
and flip the VP9 tag, you can
play back YouTube VP9 videos.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.280
And one thing this should
drive home is this was a

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.260
project that was done over the
course of two weeks, that VP9

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.060
was built into YouTube.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.810
Obviously, we have very
capable teams.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:51.500
Obviously we have people on the
WebM team and people on

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.900
the YouTube team who know a
lot about these tools, but

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:59.060
this demonstration is VP9
in the YouTube operating

00:33:59.060 --> 00:33:59.900
environment.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:01.310
There's nothing canned here.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.170
This is VP9 being encoded and
transmitted in the same way

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.620
that any other video is.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.010
So this, I hope, again, will
give you guys pause to say,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.230
god, we could do this as well.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:18.790
We could come out very quickly
with a VP9 based service that

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.120
will be remarkably better
than anything that's

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.820
out there right now.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.219
So I just want to leave you with
some thoughts about what

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.239
I hope that you're thinking
about coming away from this

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.270
presentation.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:35.760
The WebM project is a true
community-based open source

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.210
project, and obviously, these
sorts of projects thrive on

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.580
contributions from
the community.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.120
We are coming out of a period
where we've been very

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.070
intensively focused on algorithm
development.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.920
Some of this work is certainly
very complicated stuff that

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:51.860
not every--

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.130
even incredibly seasoned--

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.340
software engineer can work on.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.640
But we're moving into a point
where we're focusing on

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.460
application development, we're
focusing on optimization,

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.840
we're focusing on bug fixes and
patches, and that's the

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.070
sort of thing that people in
this room certainly can do.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:10.180
So we encourage you to
contribute and we encourage

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.170
you to advocate for use
of these technologies.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.520
We build open source
technologies, and yet simply

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.920
because we build them, that
doesn't mean that

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.090
people adopt them.

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:23.060
It takes work to get communities
to focus on

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.520
adopting these sorts of
open technologies.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.980
So advocate within your project
in your company,

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.070
advocate within your company for
use of open technologies,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.970
and advocate within the web
community as a whole.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:41.920
We think that with VP9, we've
shown the power of a rapidly

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.030
developing, open technology, and
we hope that people are as

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.630
excited about this as we are and
that you go out and help

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:51.050
spread the word about
this technology.

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:54.210
But most important, we'd like
you to use the technology.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:57.390
We're building this with a
purpose, and that is for

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.270
people to go out, take advantage
of these dramatic

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.700
steps forward that we've
made with VP9.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.760
And so we hope you will go out,
that you'll be charged up

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.900
from this presentation, and
that you'll immediately

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.950
download the Development Version
of Chrome and start

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.050
playing around with this and
start seeing what you can do

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.540
with this tool that we've
been building for you.

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.320
So there are just a couple of
other things I'd like to say.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.080
There are a couple of
other presentations

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.040
related to this project.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.850
There's a presentation on
Demystifying Video Encoding,

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:32.630
Encoding for WebM VP8--

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.350
and this is certainly
relevant to VP9--

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.740
and then another on the
WebRTC project.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.050
And again, if you're
considering a video

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.720
conferencing style application,
screensharing,

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.890
remote desktopping, this is
something that you should be

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.140
very interested in.

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.140
Sorry.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.250
I shouldn't be using
PowerPoint.

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.330
So with that, we can open
it up to questions.

00:37:13.874 --> 00:37:16.840
Can we switch to just the
Developers Screen, guys?

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.796
Do I do that?

00:37:18.796 --> 00:37:20.170
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:25.290
VP8, VP9 on mobile, do you have
any plans releasing for

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.870
iOS and integrating with
my iOS applications--

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.770
Native, Objective
C, and stuff?

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.480
Do you have any plans
for that?

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.030
MATT FROST: He's asking
if VP8 is in iOS?

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:43.700
AUDIENCE: VP9 on iOS running
on top of Objective C.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:48.590
RONALD BULTJE: So I think as
for Android, it's obvious

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:51.230
Android supports VP8 and
Android will eventually

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.110
support VP9 as well.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.360
For iOS--

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.920
MATT FROST: When I was talking
about optimizations, platform

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:02.040
optimizations, talking about
VP9, that's the sort of work

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.850
we're focusing on, ARM
optimizations that should

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:09.570
apply across all of these ARM
SOCs that are prevalent in

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.250
Android devices and
iOS devices.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:17.060
There aren't hardware
accelerators and iOS

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:18.040
platforms right now.

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.680
Obviously, that's something
we'd like to change, but

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.600
presently, if you're going to
try to support VP8 in iOS,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.735
you're going to have to do
it through software.

00:38:26.735 --> 00:38:28.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.140
RONALD BULTJE: Yep?

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.410
AUDIENCE: Bruce Lawson
from Opera.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.100
I've been advocating WebM
for a couple of years.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:34.690
One question.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.440
I expect your answer is yes.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.880
Is it your assumption that the
agreement that you came to

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.010
with MPEG LA about VP8 equally
applies to VP9?

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.490
MATT FROST: It does apply to
VP9 in a slightly different

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.660
way than it does with VP8.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.830
The agreement with MPEG LA and
the 11 licensors with respect

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.200
to VP9 covers techniques that
are common with VP8.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.060
So obviously, we've added back
some techniques we were using

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.890
in earlier versions, we've added
in some new techniques,

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.660
so there are some techniques
that aren't subject to the

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.840
license in VP9.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.880
But yes, the core techniques
which are used in VP8 are

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.310
covered by the MPEG LA license,
and there will be a

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.990
VP9 license that will be
available for developers and

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.880
manufacturers to take
advantage of.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.340
AUDIENCE: Super.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.300
Follow up question.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.720
About 18 months ago, the Chrome
team announced they

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:30.080
were going to drop H.264 being
bundled in the browser, and

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.770
that subsequently
didn't happen.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:35.070
Can you comment further on
whether Chrome will drop H.264

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.320
and concentrate only on VP9?

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.820
MATT FROST: I can't
really comment

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.580
on plans going forward.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.840
What I can say is that having
built H.264 in, it's very

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.750
difficult to remove
a technology.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.100
I think when you look at the
difference between VP9 and

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.820
H.264, there's not
going to be any

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:58.340
competition between the two.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.840
So I think with respect to VP9,
H.264 is slightly less

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.710
relevant because there
was nothing--

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:08.630
we didn't have our finger
on the scale for this

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.300
presentation.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.430
And especially, we were hoping
to drive home with that

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:16.800
initial demonstration which we
put together over the last few

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.280
hours that we're not looking
for the best videos.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.010
We're just out there
recording stuff.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.140
So even if 264 remains
in Chrome--

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.230
which I think is probably
likely--

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.790
I don't think it's going to be
relevant for a next gen codec

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.090
because there's just such
a difference in quality.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:36.062
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
your answers.

00:40:36.062 --> 00:40:36.840
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.920
I have a question about
performance.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.160
Besides the obvious difference
in royalty and licensing and

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.630
all that, can you comment on
VP9 versus HEVC, and do you

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:48.870
hope to achieve the same
performance or proof of

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:49.210
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.560
RONALD BULTJE: So the question
is in terms of quality, how do

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.970
VP9 and HEVC compare?

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and bit rate
performance, yeah.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.360
RONALD BULTJE: Right.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.830
So testing HEVC is difficult.

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:02.160
I'll answer your question
in a second.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.050
Testing HEVC is difficult
because there's currently no

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:09.380
either open source software or
commercial software available

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.970
that can actually encode
HEVC unless it's highly

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.320
developmental in nature or it
is the development model.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.150
The problem with the alpha and
beta versions that are

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.590
currently on the market for
commercial products is that

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.830
we're not allowed to use them
in comparative settings like

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:25.950
we're doing.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.260
Their license doesn't
allow us to do that.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.560
Then the problem with the
reference model is it is a

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.570
really good encoder, it gives
good quality, but it is so

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.500
enormously slow.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.560
It can do about 10 frames
an hour for a

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.990
high definition video.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:44.290
That's just not something that
we can really use in YouTube.

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.190
But yes, we've done
those tests.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.310
In terms of quality, they're
currently about equal.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.180
There's some videos where HEVC,
the reference model, is

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.720
actually about 10%,
20% better.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.160
There's also a couple of videos
where VP9 is about 10%,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.900
20% better.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.000
If you take the average over,
for example, all of those CCL

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.850
licensed YouTube clips that we
looked at, it's about a 1%

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:06.340
difference.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:10.935
I think that 1% is in favor of
HEVC if you so wish, but 1% is

00:42:10.935 --> 00:42:14.730
so small that really, we don't
think that plays a role.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:16.260
What does that mean
going forward?

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.900
Well, we're really more
interested in commercial

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.900
software that will be out there
that actually encodes

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.060
HEVC at reasonable
speed settings.

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.270
And like I said, there's
currently nothing on the

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.760
market but we're really
interested in such products,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.960
so once they are on the market
and we can use them, we

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.270
certainly will.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.030
AUDIENCE: Follow-up question
about the performance.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.840
Is this any reason to not expect
this to scale up to 4K

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.380
video or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.990
RONALD BULTJE: We think that
the current high definition

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.200
trend is mostly going towards
720p and 1080p.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.505
So if you look at YouTube
uploads, there is basically no

00:42:51.505 --> 00:42:54.180
4K material there, so it's
just really hard to find

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.740
testing materials, and that's
why we mostly use 720p and

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:58.560
1080p material.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.080
MATT FROST: But certainly when
we designed the codec, we

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.380
designed it with 4K in mind.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.690
There aren't any limitations
which are going to prevent it

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.960
from doing 4K.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.150
RONALD BULTJE: Right.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:10.370
You can use this all the way up
to 16K video if that's what

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.585
you were asking.

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:13.300
MATT FROST: Sir?

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.683
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:13.683 --> 00:43:16.160
Have you been talking to the
WebRTC team, and do you know

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.030
when they're going to integrate
VP9 into their

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.280
current products?

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.200
MATT FROST: We talk with the
WebRTC team regularly.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.470
As I said, we've got to finish
our real time enhancements in

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.820
order to actually have a codec
that works well in a real time

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:33.450
environment before we can expect
it to be integrated

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.310
into WebRTC.

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:40.256
But I think we're looking
at Q4 2013.

00:43:40.256 --> 00:43:41.320
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.200
MATT FROST: We're
in 2013, right?

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.180
RONALD BULTJE: Yeah.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:44.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.680
I just wanted to talk
about the rate of

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.040
change in video codecs.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.880
I think maybe we can see like
VP8, VP9, we're talking about

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.820
an accelerating rate
of change.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.070
And that's great, and I really
wanted to applaud the efforts

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.295
to getting this out in Chrome
Dev quickly, or

00:43:57.295 --> 00:43:58.810
Chrome Stable quickly.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.130
I just wanted to ask about
maybe some of your

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.520
relationships with other
software vendors that are

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.840
going to be relevant, like we're
talking Mozilla, IE, iOS

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.510
was, I think, previously
mentioned.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.540
As this kind of rate of
innovation in codecs

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.480
increases, how are we going to
make sure that we can have as

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.760
few transcode targets
as possible?

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.810
My company is working
on a video product.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.810
We don't want to have eight
different codecs.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:29.250
And if we can imagine, let's
say, that Version 10 comes out

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:30.640
relatively soon, sometime
down the road.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:33.620
How can we make sure that
devices stick with a

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.790
relatively small subset of
compatible decodings?

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:40.230
MATT FROST: I guess I'm
a little unsure

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.680
of what you're asking.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.820
In terms of how we get support
on devices as quickly as

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.000
possible, or how we solve
the transcoding problem?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.700
AUDIENCE: And just keeping the
number of transcoded formats

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.830
as small as possible.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.420
If IE only supports
H.264, I have to

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.730
have an H.264 encoding.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.980
So I was just wondering what
kind of relationships you guys

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.440
are working on to make sure
that as many devices and

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.510
platforms as possible can
support something like VP9.

00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:09.990
MATT FROST: We're certainly
working very hard on that, and

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:16.230
as I said in the slide on next
steps showing the timeline,

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.900
our focus on having hardware
designs out there as quickly

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.820
as possible is an effort to try
to make sure that there's

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.650
hardware that supports VP9 more
rapidly than hardware has

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.850
ever been out to support
a new format.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:33.140
We had a VP9 summit two weeks
ago, which was largely

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.280
attended by semiconductor
companies.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:42.240
Actually, some other very
encouraging companies were

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.730
there with great interest in
these new technologies.

00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:49.310
But we're working very hard with
our hardware partners and

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.610
with OEMs to make sure that this
is supported as quickly

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:53.470
as possible.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.440
I think internally, what we're
looking at is probably relying

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.410
on VP8 to the extent that we
need hardware now and we don't

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.470
have it in VP9.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.670
So I think what we've talked
about is always falling back

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:10.500
to an earlier version of an open
technology that has very

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.130
broad hardware support.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:16.160
But we're trying to think very
creatively about things like

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.270
transcoding and things that we
can do to ensure backwards

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.340
compatibility or enhancement
layers.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:29.750
So part of the focus of this
open development cycle and

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.770
process that we have is to
really try to think in very

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:36.310
new ways about how we support
new technologies while

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.250
maintaining the benefits of
hardware support or device

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.240
support for older
technologies.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:41.590
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.720
Thank you.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.500
AUDIENCE: So a key point in any
solution is going to be

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.610
performance.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.450
Hardware acceleration really
solves that, and that was one

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.270
of the challenges with the
adoption of VP8 in timing

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.420
versus H.264, which has broad
spectrum hardware

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.050
acceleration.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.880
I understand the timing, the
delays, and the efforts you

00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:00.220
guys are doing to really
achieve that hardware

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.420
accelerated support for VP9.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:03.730
But until then, what's the
software performance in

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:07.020
comparison to H.264, for
either both software,

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.840
software, or software,
hardware?

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.400
RONALD BULTJE: So we've only
done software, software

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.650
comparisons for that.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:15.360
Let me start VP8 264.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.000
Currently, VP8 decoding is about
twice as fast as 264

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.350
decoding using fully
optimized decoders.

00:47:22.350 --> 00:47:26.920
VP9 is about twice as slow
currently as VP8, decoding,

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.900
and that basically means that
it's exactly at the same speed

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.470
as H.264 decoding.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.330
That's not what we're targeting
as a final product.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.970
We haven't finished fully
optimizing the decoder.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.470
Eventually, what we hope to get
is about a 40% slowdown

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.330
from VP8 decoding, and that will
put it well ahead of the

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:48.310
fastest 264 decoders that are
out there in software.

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:48.370
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.282
Thank you.

00:47:50.282 --> 00:47:50.760
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.990
I was just wanting to get some
background on the comparison

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.210
between H.264 and VP9.

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.060
For H.264, what were
you using--

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:05.590
CVR, BVR, and what QP values?

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.260
RONALD BULTJE: This is
two path encoding at

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.310
the target bit rate.

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:11.960
So it's preset very slow.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.780
Since we're doing visual
comparison,

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.750
there is no tune set.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:19.200
It's paths one or two, and then
just a target bit rate.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.460
We tend to choose target bit
rates that are somewhere

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:27.760
between 100 and 1,000 kilobits
a second, and then we just

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.050
pick the same point for the VP9
one as well to start with.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.410
AUDIENCE: So in both of the
comparisons, you were trying

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:38.280
to be very generic so you
weren't tuning the encoder in

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:42.320
any way to make it a better
quality at that bit rate.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.240
You were just giving it two
paths to try to figure it out.

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.980
RONALD BULTJE: So you mean
visual quality, or--

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.020
RONALD BULTJE: So we haven't
tuned either one of them for

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.020
any specific setting.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:57.430
For 264, the default is that
it optimizes for visual

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:01.140
experience, and so that's why
we optimized it to 6414.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.580
So it's not optimized for SSIM
or PSNR in the visual displace

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.720
that we did here.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.200
VP9 encoding does not have any
such tunes, so we're not

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.990
setting any item, of course.

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.490
AUDIENCE: So you just used
the default settings of

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:13.760
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.500
RONALD BULTJE: We're using the
default settings, and we've

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.450
actually discussed this
extensively with the 264

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.700
developers.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.260
They agree.

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.390
They support this kind of
testing methodology, and as

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.350
far as I'm aware, they
agree with it.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:28.620
They fully expect the
kind of results that

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:29.750
we're getting here.

00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:30.220
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.570
OK, thanks.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.030
One more question about
performance.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.150
I think you mentioned a little
bit about the real time.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:44.420
So do you think in the future,
you can manage to bring an

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.120
application like application
desktop into the web?

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.760
I mean like putting three,
four windows in the same

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:56.710
browser, high definition,
things like that?

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:59.940
RONALD BULTJE: In terms of
decoding or encoding?

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:01.730
AUDIENCE: Both.

00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.170
RONALD BULTJE: So for
encoding, yes.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.080
So there will be real time
settings for this codec

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.660
eventually.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.280
For no codec will that get you
exactly the types of bit rate

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.790
quality ratios that you're
seeing here.

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:19.550
These are really using very slow
settings, and that is by

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.090
far not real time.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:25.000
But if you set the VP9 codec
to real time settings, then

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.950
yes, eventually it will
encode in real time.

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.100
It will be able to do four full
desktops all at once, and

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.030
it will be able to decode
all of those also.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.540
You'll probably need a multicore
machine for this,

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:36.770
obviously, but it will be
able to do it, yes.

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.980
AUDIENCE: And you're using
the graphics card and

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:41.035
other things like that.

00:50:41.035 --> 00:50:46.950
You didn't mention about the
hardware, OpenGL or--

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.280
RONALD BULTJE: It's
future software.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.230
There's no hardware involved.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:52.310
AUDIENCE: No using the hardware,
the card hardware.

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.810
RONALD BULTJE: We're not using
GPU or anything like that at

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.040
this point.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.840
I just want to know, how does
a VP9, now or later, compare

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:09.540
to VP8 and H.264 when we're
talking about single task CBR,

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.140
low bitrate, real
time encoding?

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.120
Little background is we are
part of the screen sharing

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.260
utility that currently uses
VP8, and we've been

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.360
successfully using it for a
year, but the biggest gripe

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.080
with VP8 is that it doesn't
respect bit rate, especially

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.490
on low bit rates, unless you
enable frame dropping, which

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.190
is unacceptable.

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.150
So we have to do a bunch of
hacks to actually produce

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:32.200
quality and it doesn't
behave like H.264

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.970
would in that situation.

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:37.590
So how will VP9 address that
problem, or is that even on

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.480
the roadmap?

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.620
RONALD BULTJE: So in general,
desktop sharing and

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.410
applications like this, also
real time communications, yes,

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.060
they're on the roadmap,
and yes,

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.720
they will all be supported.

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.090
In terms of your specific
problem, I guess the best

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:51.963
thing to do is why don't you
come and see us afterwards in

00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:54.060
the Chrome [INAUDIBLE], and we
can actually look at that.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:55.150
AUDIENCE: OK, awesome.

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.870
RONALD BULTJE: As for VP9,
VP9 currently does not

00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:58.715
have a one pass mode.

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:01.370
We've removed that to just speed
up development, but it

00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:04.300
will eventually be re-added, and
it will be as fast as the

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:08.020
VP8 one but with a 50% reduction
in bit rate.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:09.505
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a timeline for that?

00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:11.115
Is it going to this year,
or next year?

00:52:11.115 --> 00:52:13.550
RONALD BULTJE: Like Matt said,
that will happen--

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.010
MATT FROST: Late Q3.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:17.900
RONALD BULTJE: Q3 2013,
around then.

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.940
We're currently focusing on
YouTube, and those kind of

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.266
things will come after that.

00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:22.940
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.490
Thank you.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.430
AUDIENCE: I have two questions,
unrelated

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.500
questions to that.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.190
What is the latency performance
of VP8 compared to

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:36.300
VP9 in terms of decoding
and encoding?

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:42.820
And the second question is, how
does VP9 compare to H.265?

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.820
RONALD BULTJE: So I think H.265,
I addressed earlier.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:50.690
So do you want me to go into
that further, or was that OK?

00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:53.550
AUDIENCE: More in terms of the
real time performance.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:55.730
RONALD BULTJE: So in terms of
real time performance, I think

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.740
for both, that's really, really
hard to say because

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.380
there is no real time HEVC
encoder and there is no real

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:02.650
time VP9 encoder.

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:05.560
So I can sort of guess, but
this is something that the

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.720
future will have to tell us.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.770
We will put a lot of effort
into writing real time

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.350
encoders or adapting our
encoder to be real time

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.610
capable because that is
very important for us.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.020
MATT FROST: But in terms of
raw latency, it should be

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.270
faster than VP8.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.400
You can decode the first
frame, right?

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.260
RONALD BULTJE: I think it
will be the same as VP8.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.010
So VP8 allows one frame in, one
frame out, and VP9 will

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.940
allow exactly that same
frame control model.

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:38.660
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
you've asked hardware

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.480
manufacturers for any concerns
or comments.

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.112
Have you gotten any yet?

00:53:42.112 --> 00:53:42.490
MATT FROST: Sorry.

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:44.530
Are considering supporting it?

00:53:44.530 --> 00:53:47.200
AUDIENCE: Well, in terms of
the algorithms and how you

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.520
would actually--

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.050
MATT FROST: They're working
on it quickly.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:52.070
AUDIENCE: But there's no
concerns or comments or

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.390
anything yet?

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.520
MATT FROST: No concerns.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.890
AUDIENCE: You said you opened
up for comments.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:53:59.060
MATT FROST: No.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.530
We have received comments.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:05.910
We have a hardware team
internally that took a first

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:06.690
pass at comments.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.240
We've received a couple of
comments additionally just

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:14.610
saying, here's some stuff you're
doing in software that

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.630
doesn't implement well,
and hardware.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:20.530
I don't foresee a lot of
additional comments from the

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:22.480
hardware manufacturers.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.080
The other work that we're doing
over the next 45 days is

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.240
we had a bunch of experiments
that we had to close out, and

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.100
so we're doing some closing
out as well and just

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.350
finishing the code.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:41.100
Absent act of God, this is bit
stream final on June 17.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.220
RONALD BULTJE: So we have
actually received comments

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:45.020
from some hardware
manufacturers, and we are

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:47.200
actively addressing the ones
that we're getting.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.360
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.170
I might have missed this, but
when did you say the ARM

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.612
optimizations for VP9 are
going to come out?

00:54:58.170 --> 00:55:00.930
MATT FROST: Actually starting
now really, we're focusing on

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.920
doing some optimizations by
ourselves and with partners.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:08.340
So I would say that's going to
be coming out second half of

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.510
the year, and it'll probably be
sort of incremental where

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.960
you may get an initial pass of
ARM optimizations and then

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.980
some final optimization.

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:20.640
It's obviously very important
for us for Android to be able

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.740
to get VP9 working as well as
possible, and obviously, ARM

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.580
is incredibly important for
the Android ecosystem, so

00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:29.430
that's an area of significant
focus.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:34.790
AUDIENCE: And in terms of real
time encoding, so in order to

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:36.620
blend into WebRTC,
you're going to

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.710
have to get that working.

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.720
So is this going to coincide
with the assimilation of VP9

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.520
into WebRTC?

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.790
MATT FROST: It'll be real time
optimizations, which I think

00:55:47.790 --> 00:55:52.060
we were sort of thinking about
end of Q3, beginning of Q4,

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:55.540
and then integration into WebRTC
will follow on that.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.270
Obviously, the one thing
I'd say, it's

00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.670
an open source project.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:02.660
If you guys think that you see
an opportunity, you can go out

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.380
and do the optimizations
yourselves.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.030
There are contractors
who can do it.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:09.170
So I encourage you guys to think
about that, that you can

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:11.060
take the code and you can start
working on some of this

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.440
stuff yourselves.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.910
Obviously, we'd love it if you'd
contribute it back but

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.160
we're not going to
force you to.

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.025
Yeah, I guess last question.

00:56:20.025 --> 00:56:22.940
AUDIENCE: This is a question
about how VP9 relates to what

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:25.120
the Android team talked about
with Google proxy and the

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:25.880
speedy proxy.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.180
You alluded to transcoding
real time for backwards

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.370
compatible device support.

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:33.200
Do you see Google doing the same
thing they're going to do

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.230
with images in this proxy and
doing video transcoding to

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.900
adapt this and use this
for compression mode

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:39.520
in the Google proxy?

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:41.950
RONALD BULTJE: That's a really
interesting application, and

00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:44.730
that's something that we'll have
to look into the future.

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:48.060
It's not as easy as it sounds
because video transcoding

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.370
actually takes some time.

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.410
So that would mean that you
would actually have to wait a

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.610
minute while the video is
transcoding until you can

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:59.570
visit that website, and that
might not be quite what you're

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:00.690
looking for.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:03.250
But it's an interesting
application and we might look

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:04.500
into that in the future.

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.570
MATT FROST: I think that's it.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:10.440
I think we're out of time.

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.030
Sorry, but we're happy to
talk to you afterwards.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.600
[APPLAUSE]
