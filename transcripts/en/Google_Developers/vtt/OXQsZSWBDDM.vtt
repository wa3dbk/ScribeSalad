BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.070
interesting developer community.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.900
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.990
has asked this question.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.436
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.460
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.710
would like to ask questions.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:43.242
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.870
PETE LEPAGE: Welcome,
everybody.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600
Really awesome event today.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.340
We're taking a behind scenes
look at Movi Kanti Revo, one

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.980
of the new Chrome experiments
that just launched yesterday.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.390
My name's Pete LePage, I'm a
developer advocate with the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.270
Chrome team.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.810
And with me, we've got Aubrey
and KC from Subatomic who

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.650
built this absolutely phenomenal
experience.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.970
Do you guys want to introduce
yourself?

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.320
AUBREY ANDERSON: Sure, my
name's Aubrey Anderson.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.790
I'm the president
of Subatomic.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.990
KC AUSTIN: My name
is KC Austin.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.200
I'm one of the lead developers
on this project.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.430
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.920
So this launched yesterday.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.580
This is something that has been
coming to fruition for us

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.460
for probably four or
five months now.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.750
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
about five months.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.930
I'd say we started storyboarding
and concepting

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.730
probably fully five
months ago.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.230
And then did some initial
concept work in the browser

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.370
just to make sure that all our
assumptions, or at least most

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.710
of our assumptions were
going to true.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.430
And then we had a long period
of just asset creation where

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.090
we went out to Las Vegas and
shot the Cirque people doing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.370
their performances on the
blue [? sight. ?]

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.760
And a lot of post production,
and just getting what they

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.960
call mats sorted out, and
getting everybody keyed.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.410
And sort of in parallel to
that, KC and I have been

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.610
developing the browser, working
on building scenes.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.610
And we'll kind of show you how
we build the scenes as we go.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.850
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome, cool.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.400
So for those of you who are
watching live right now, we do

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.800
have a moderator queue, that
if you want to go post your

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.030
questions, you can go post
your questions there.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.800
We'll take your live
questions towards

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.870
the end of our session.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.560
So as we dive into some of these
things, please post your

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.640
questions there.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.670
Let's jump in and talk about
some of the 3D experiences and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.620
how those were built.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.820
Because it's a pretty new
concept for the browser to put

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.420
all of these pieces into the
world and actually build

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.530
something that as it rotates
and moves, really the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.720
prospective just changes.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.670
You've got a really neat
parallaxing going on, all of

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.810
that kind of stuff.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.490
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, so maybe
we'll show you a little

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.890
bit, in case you haven't
seen the experience.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.340
PETE LEPAGE: All right, well if
we can bring up the screen.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.587
Great.

00:03:13.587 --> 00:03:16.390
AUBREY ANDERSON: It looks
like it's happening.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.940
So I'm just going hold off on
the microphone for now.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.290
So what we've done, we've tried
to keep to sort of a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.400
theatrical approach
but do that with

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.330
elements in the browser.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.950
And I'm just going to rotate
this model as we look at.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.820
These are all divs, which is a
sort of important distinction

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.050
from technologies like WebGL or
other ways that you might

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.570
manipulate content in 3D.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.170
But the other challenge we
had is integrating video.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.100
So in this example, you'll see,
as obviously in the real

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.620
experience, you can't turn the
model around because that sort

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.710
of blows it.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.320
But I think it's sort of good to
understand how these things

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.450
are stacked up in 3D space.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.940
We have the front layer here,
which is a video element.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.470
That's a piece of
WebM that we're

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.525
loading and playing back.

00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:08.070
And that has the same background
in the same

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.520
proportions as you see when the
interactive part of the

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.640
experience starts.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.600
But if I flip it here,
you'll see that's

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.050
the back of the video.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.760
There's the sea, which is
actually titled away from us a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.160
little bit.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.734
And then these other elements,
the links, and the back plate.

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:26.340
And if you can see, even farther
behind that, is sort

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.390
of the sky, and the sea,
and some kind of

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.610
foggy elements there.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.980
And as the video plays out, what
it does is it just kind

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.180
of crossfades to the 3D elements
behind it and creates

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.120
this kind of relatively
fluid experience.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.350
I think it's just about to
go in to crossfade here.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.980
KC AUSTIN: We actually build the
scene in CSS with all the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.330
separate elements first.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.720
Screenshot that, composited
that screenshot into the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.760
background plate of the video,
and then that got exported at

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.560
WebM, so it crossfades
perfectly.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.610
AUBREY ANDERSON: So there's
a real back and forth.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.330
And for post-production people,
this is kind of a new

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.040
idea because they're used to
just sort of getting a

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.240
drawing, getting some art,
and then having to

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.460
put that in the video.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.810
But in this case, that
was only the start.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.700
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.720
So now one of the things I know
we were playing with and

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.740
looking at early on was that
WebM doesn't do alpha

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.050
transparency yet.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.310
AUBREY ANDERSON: It's true.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.980
Fortunately, for everybody,
I think that's coming.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.880
And we worked with the animation
codec as a way to

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.770
kind of comp these things
together, which does do video

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.800
transparency.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.710
Obviously you can't put that on
the web because the files

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.370
are hundreds of meg.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.440
But one of the things we look
forward to is being able to

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.020
actually live composite these
elements right into the scene.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.980
So rather than having a back
plate inside the video like we

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.740
saw and having to do this sort
hoop jumping of switching it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.670
out, we'll be able to just
make the background

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.500
transparent, key out the
characters, and just park them

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.020
right in the 3D model,
which is just going

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.220
to be insanely powerful.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.990
KC AUSTIN: And all the scenes
are actually built now.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.430
Even the contortionist scene
with the tree behind it, the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.440
tree was built with CSS, with
every strip of bark on it is a

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.790
different PNG.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.530
PETE LEPAGE: Oh wow.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.730
KC AUSTIN: So it's built in
3D and rotated behind the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.210
characters.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.650
And as soon as we found out
that alpha wasn't going to

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.730
make it, we set it up to
screenshot it, composite it

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.080
again behind.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.515
But all the scenes are set
up, so they do work

00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:37.750
if you had the alpha.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.430
PETE LEPAGE: So we have a case
study that I sort of took this

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.020
particular scene and took it
apart and sort of built each

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.230
of the pieces individually.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.890
But why don't we open up the dev
tools and have a look at,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.530
or even some real code,
and have a look at

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.620
what's going on here.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.890
Like how is this built?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.840
AUBREY ANDERSON: I think that's
a super great idea.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.950
The other think I just wanted to
point out also is that you

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.860
can kind of keep going
in Z space.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.300
So here, if you hit back button,
we have the pink man.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.800
And this is just sort
of non sequitur.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.180
It's just something that
happens if you

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.170
happen to find this.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.420
PETE LEPAGE: It's a nice
little Easter egg.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.490
AUBREY ANDERSON: A little
Easter egg, exactly.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.720
You can zoom the whole model out
and you can keep going in

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.490
3D space, both forward and back,
and left and right, and

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.960
up and down.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.900
Yeah, probably the easiest
thing is to just sort of

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.320
inspect some of this stuff
as a way to get started.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.800
KC AUSTIN: Start with like the
rotational containers?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.050
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.696
I can kind of show you some
of the anatomy of how

00:07:34.696 --> 00:07:35.900
this is built out.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.030
This is probably small
text for you guys.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.550
Sorry about that.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.880
But you will at least get a
sense of how the rotation is

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.280
accomplished.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.710
We have several div containers
which have 3D prospective

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.040
applied to them via CSS.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.980
And I think one of the biggest
brain challenges is not

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.580
thinking of elements as singular
and transformable by

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.230
themselves.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.780
A lot of times, a complex
transformation is happening

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.460
because the element is moving
and its container is moving on

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.580
a different axis, and its
container is moving maybe on a

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.520
different axis.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.310
So we find this model is
generally contained in three

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:18.200
boxes and each box generally
handles one axis of the

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.290
rotation, which gives us kind of
an infinite flexibility in

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.310
moving this model around.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.890
We can move it up and down, left
and right, and kind of

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.600
tilt it all around.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.020
But that requires three
containers to really

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.250
accomplish it in the way
that you would want.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.970
I think I see when people first
approach CSS and 3D,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.380
they're like, well, I have the
element, and I put it, I

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.909
rotated it, and then I wanted to
rotate it that way as well,

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:44.550
and that didn't work.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.260
And it's like, well, it's a
container within a container.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.200
It's just a slightly different
way to think about it.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.040
KC AUSTIN: It's a lot easier to
think about it that way, to

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.640
separate out the translates
and the rotates as well.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.620
Because in the CSS transform,
you have to have translate 3D

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.930
and rotate within the
same transform

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.680
block in the same string.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.020
So if you break those out, you
now can have the translate 3D

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.020
on one div and then the
container and then another

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.610
container have the rotate, and
you can affect them separately

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.860
and not have to worry about.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.120
AUBREY ANDERSON: So I just
wanted to kind of point out a

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.840
couple of things.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.140
We also lean very heavily
on animation.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.220
So I'll show you this behavior
really quick.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:30.340
So when this v first loads,
you'll see it sort of does

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.370
this long drift down here.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.400
And you are sort of drifting
through this

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.820
kind of 3D star field.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.190
Each of these stars is a PNG
file that KC has placed in

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.190
real space, more or less.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.100
PETE LEPAGE: There's
one scene that just

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.920
sort of blew me away.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.270
The one scene where the women
are blowing the little

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.765
fireflies off.

00:09:50.765 --> 00:09:54.490
And just the fact that each one
of those stars is its own

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.530
item that sort of moves
in space and time.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.710
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, each
one has a class.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.750
It's just one class for a star
that has this tiny PNG and I

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.300
just looped through a couple
hundred times, placed them in

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.520
random positions in Z, X, Y. And
it kind of gives you that

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.880
parallaxing feel when you
rotate everything.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.780
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, that's
this view here.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.430
This is an interesting
view as well.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.840
Each of these elements is
obviously, we're accomplishing

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.070
transparency here, but not in
the way you might think.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:28.100
This is a video that we're
making manually by using a

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.800
long animation and moving a
background sprite around.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.540
So each of these women is
actually a big sprite sheet of

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:40.900
PNGs that we're applying an
animation and stepping from

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.340
scene to scene.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, very cool.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.530
OK.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.180
KC AUSTIN: Since we move through
that scene, we can't

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.080
do any sort of background
compositing behind the videos.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.860
So in this case, we had
to do a sprite sheet.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.500
And it's basically like
an insanely large PNG.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.860
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.350
KC AUSTIN: But I mean, even then
as an optimized PNG, it's

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.160
like maybe a meg and a half
per sprite sheet.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.840
So it's not as big as a
video would be anyway.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.620
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, like I was
going to say, compare that to

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.370
a video, and it's pretty much
the same size or smaller in

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.620
some cases.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.470
AUBREY ANDERSON: Just if you're
starting from scratch

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.420
with this technology, I think
it's just important to

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.850
understand how things
get glued together.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.140
So you'll see in the code
here, we're applying a

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.240
transform on this element.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.860
This has an interesting
side effect.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.870
When you translate something 3D,
it also will bounce that

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:41.073
element down into the hardware,
essentially put it

00:11:41.073 --> 00:11:44.990
in the GPU's stack, rather
than having the

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.990
CPU have to do it.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:52.020
And also, importantly, think
in terms of prefixes.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.130
This is probably how
you will start

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.850
working with it in Chrome.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.250
We use a framework called
Neutrino, which helps us

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.320
simplify some of the language.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.930
And each of these, in a
different browser context,

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.140
will have a different prefix.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:14.380
Like that for Mozilla, like that
for Opera, and like that

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.590
sort of the various WebKits,
Chrome, Safari,

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.874
that type of thing.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:21.890
We've done that.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.560
There's a couple of frameworks
out there that will

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.680
help you with this.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:24.935
PETE LEPAGE: That's awesome.

00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:25.610
AUBREY ANDERSON:
It's just nice.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.657
This is how it will look
in a year or two.

00:12:27.657 --> 00:12:30.670
So just to get yourself thinking
in terms of the

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.590
unprefixed syntax sooner
than later.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.190
And just kind of a
couple things to

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.230
try to parse through.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.660
There are transforms and
there are animations.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.470
And animations are just
sequences of CSS state.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.970
Generally they're sequences of
transform state, but they can

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.640
be any state you want.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.900
You can go from a big fat
border to a tiny border.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.550
You can go from a blue
background to a red

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.490
background.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.830
And what the CSS animation
engine does is it essentially

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.070
tweens those states for you.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.610
So you express yourself
in terms of

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.910
where you want to start.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.490
I want the element to begin 700
pixels back in Z space.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.960
So these three elements, this
is X, this is Y, and this is

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.870
Z. And I would like it to end
transformed 90 pixels over,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.660
that's 90 pixels to the right.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:30.100
1,400 pixels down, that's a
push down on the y-axis.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.520
And 100 pixels forward
in Z space.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.110
So you can kind of think
this through.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.960
The element is moving from
somewhere back there to a

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.300
little bit forward of, if you
think of zero, that's the

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.540
plane of your browser,
sort of.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.670
But it's moving forward in
space, as well as down.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.240
It's also a scaling.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.790
So actually, a really immense
amount of stuff if you were

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.245
thinking of this, trying to
accomplish this in, say, a

00:13:57.245 --> 00:13:59.690
canvas, this would be very,
very hard to express.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.810
Just this simple thing, you'd
have to get really granular

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.160
about what was happening to
the element fame by frame.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.460
But here, we just say start
here and end here, take 25

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.630
seconds to make that happen.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.610
And you can even apply some kind
of using easing, sort of

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.510
Robert Penner style
math to how you

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.340
begin and end the animation.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.920
In this case, ease in/out means
that it will sort of

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.880
have a parabolic ramp up, get to
a midpoint, and then have a

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.490
parabolic ramp down, which just
gives it a little more

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.340
organic feel.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.590
KC AUSTIN: We tried to use
animation as much as we could.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.390
Like the bubbles, when you
create a bubble, you just

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.840
place it in a random position,
and then just

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.340
add a class to it.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.590
And when you add that class,
it adds the ascendant key

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.790
frame animation and
the bubble rises.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.690
So you don't have
to go through.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.380
It's just as simple as
creating the div.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.170
PETE LEPAGE: And adding
that class--

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.070
KC AUSTIN: And then it goes.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.910
PETE LEPAGE: --and it
all happens for you.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.470
KC AUSTIN: And if you create
those at different times, then

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.220
you'd get a bunch of bubble
all floating up.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.160
PETE LEPAGE: Very cool.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.440
One of the things I noticed as I
started playing with some of

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.010
these 3D animations was that
when you apply a transform on

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.340
the z-axis, it pushes it back,
but it also does exactly what

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.880
physics says it should do.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.640
AUBREY ANDERSON: It
gets smaller.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.620
PETE LEPAGE: And it
makes it smaller.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.260
AUBREY ANDERSON: That's true.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.500
PETE LEPAGE: So that's one of
those ones where keeping in

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.400
mind that scale factor
is really important.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.580
Because you're going to put
something back or move it

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.150
really close, all of a sudden
it's going to go from being

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.350
whatever size you expected
it to be to

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.070
being bigger or smaller.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.530
AUBREY ANDERSON: I think that's
another important thing

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.010
to keep in mind too, that what
you get from the rendering

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.790
engine generally reflects
reality, but for an

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.320
interactive environment
that's not always

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.100
what you want to do.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.160
It's a little bit like
deceleration physics on a

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.190
touch device.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.570
They're not real physics because
real physics actually

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.220
don't feel that good.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.550
Like the way an element really
decelerates in space, from an

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.990
interactive perspective is
kind of not that cool.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.900
So the same with transforms,
a lot of times we'll find

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.770
ourselves subtly scaling things
up or down and actually

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.560
pulling them out of whatever
you might characterize as

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.630
realism in terms of a real 3D
model, if you're thinking in

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.730
terms of like WebGL terms.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.980
But in order to make them sit
right compositionally and just

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:17.910
to make when your brain looks
at you go, oh yeah, probably

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.510
that tree and that person
are in the same world.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.480
Oftentimes you have to bring
the person way forward and

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.860
scale them way down.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.260
Because bringing them forward
makes them big, and even

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.110
though that is the right
perspective, you have to scale

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.700
them down in order to just
buy it compositionally.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.060
I'll show you another example.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.090
So these lanterns, you'll see
they're sort of randomized,

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.610
and they kind of float out, and
then eventually will shoot

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.390
up into the sky.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.240
Again, this programmatically
would be relatively difficult

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.300
to express because you'd have to
sort of micromanage each of

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.620
these elements.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.750
But in our case here, we
don't actually have

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.850
to do that at all.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.170
We have a lantern.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.280
This is how every
lantern starts.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.690
And we have a little
particle generator

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.720
that makes a new lantern.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.380
Every time a lantern gets thrown
up there, it's pushed a

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.250
little bit in left space.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.200
It has some sort of width and
height, and all the stuff

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.460
you'd normally do to a div
to get it to render.

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.869
And we set a starting point.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.950
And then we just attach an
animation to it every time it

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:19.520
gets added.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.150
And I think the attachment of
the animation can happen also

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.640
in JavaScript, which
is important.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.890
You can sort of wait.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.050
And in this case, the lanterns
start all hidden.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.550
And in JavaScript when the video
is ended, we get the

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.980
ended event on the video, and
we kick off these sort of

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.830
lantern animations.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.770
PETE LEPAGE: So the lanterns
can start floating in.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.150
AUBREY ANDERSON: They can start
floating in, exactly.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.720
But then we can forget about
it, which is awesome.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.780
The lanterns all go through
this same transformation.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.100
But JavaScript, as it loops
through, is setting a

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.200
different time on
the animation.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.880
So the speed at which
they go through it

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.430
will change and randomize.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.500
The place they start, X and Y,
will change and randomize.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.210
But what happens from there
is always the same.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.895
It goes through this
transform, it

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:01.640
drifts basically up.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.400
But if you think of it in 3D
space, up sort of means away

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.995
because we're also scaling them
down as they drift up.

00:18:08.995 --> 00:18:14.350
So you can see the go from this
sort of Y positioning up

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.790
to slightly less
Y positioning.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:21.480
And then in the last 10% of the
animation, they shoot way

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.830
up in Y, which has the visual
effect of making them go up

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.550
into space.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.840
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, I think
that's one of my favorite

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.570
things about the animation, is
being able to say, hey, I

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.240
start at zero, and obviously
I'm going to

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.545
specify my end animation.

00:18:36.545 --> 00:18:39.940
But you can also put in sort of
middle points where you can

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:46.250
say, hey, I want the middle
point to be maybe at 80%.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.570
You can get that math
built yourself.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.210
Like you could go, oh hey,
I want it to go how

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:52.360
I want it to work.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.450
AUBREY ANDERSON: Absolutely, and
you can get really sort of

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.750
propeller heady about it.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.390
This I believe is five
digit precision.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.775
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, wow, I didn't
know that actually.

00:18:59.775 --> 00:19:01.710
AUBREY ANDERSON: Some browsers
have three digit precision, so

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:02.950
I recommended keeping
to three.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.260
But I believe Chrome actually
observes five.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.670
So you can get very,
very specific.

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.130
This in a four second animation,
obviously, is not

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.120
something you'd do very often.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.110
But if you have a very
long-lived animation,

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.850
something that takes 100
seconds, or 500 seconds,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.090
sometimes to get the timing just
right, like when you're

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.010
motion mapping video.

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.290
KC AUSTIN: That's what we were
doing for the videos.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.040
I actually wrote something so
that when you hit the Space

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.630
bar during a video, it would
get put the time over the

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.660
duration and log that.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.090
And then I could just
copy, paste that

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.220
into here and do that.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.970
And that's how we would track
where things to sync things up

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:40.890
with video.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.160
AUBREY ANDERSON: Oh,
that's cool.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.980
So you'd leave the video rolling
and just go tap.

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:44.150
KC AUSTIN: The video rolling,
and I'd be like, OK, I want

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.415
that to happen here, and then
boom, and then just copy that

00:19:46.415 --> 00:19:49.095
in, and that's where that
key frame basically is.

00:19:49.095 --> 00:19:52.500
It's kind of like
a queue point.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.770
AUBREY ANDERSON: Chrome as a
tool for motion mapping.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.880
That's pretty badass.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.310
So do you want to talk about the
fireflies at little bit.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:04.750
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, so the
fireflies, I thought about how

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.250
we could do with that sort of
the key frame animation, but

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.820
we needed them more reactive.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:16.220
So when they're made, they're
generated, and then they sort

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.990
of fly down the path in front of
you in Z. And then when you

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.120
get to the next scene at the
fork, they kind of split and

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.150
go left and right.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.040
And that's where you
can choose a path,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.560
either left or right.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.760
And when you lean left, they
have to all kind of

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.660
hover to the left.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.650
When you lean right, they have
to hover to the right.

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.340
So in that case, since they're
reactive, we couldn't really

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.210
use the key frame animations.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.290
So as you can see here, they're
kind of just flying

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.680
down in front of you.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.020
So there's a state that they all
look for that's out in the

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.840
main application that's
called control.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.450
And if that's set to center,
they just go in the center.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.150
If that's set to right, they
all move to the right, if

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.590
that's set to left.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.280
So you can call that
from anywhere,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.980
and set that variable.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.040
For example, right now--

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.770
AUBREY ANDERSON: You'll see
them, there, they're more or

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.240
less centered.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.160
Or they're split, right?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.480
KC AUSTIN: Left and right.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.820
If you just make this variable
control, if you set it to

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.570
right, you'll see them
all kind of--

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.300
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, and they
all move to the right.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.760
KC AUSTIN: --they all
meander over.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.020
And then if you set it
to split, they split.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.800
And then if you set it to left,
they'll all meander over

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.270
to the other side.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.080
And these, there's an object.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.950
There's a few ways that I was
experimenting with doing this.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.560
There was the jQuery
thing where you can

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.870
add data to a div.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.360
And that was the first thing.

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.870
But I ended up just doing the
way that I'm used to doing,

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.700
which is I have an object that's
a firefly JavaScript

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.110
object that has all the X, Y, Z
positions and the logic for

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.220
updating it, the particle.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.400
So it's a very simple
particle system that

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.670
updates on every frame.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.910
And then I have a loop
that goes through

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.340
and updates all those.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.150
And then within that object,
there's also a

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.080
reference to the div.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.330
AUBREY ANDERSON: Are those
guys their own view?

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.430
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, they
have their own view.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.440
It's fireflies.js.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.250
So you'll see, this is
the fireflies object.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.380
Oh, this is the control here,
so that could be center,

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:34.180
split, and then disperse just
sends them off of the screen.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.570
Where to generate them in the
beginning is a whole other

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.560
thing to get into.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.520
But we needed them to actually
show up at the end of the hand

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.210
when the siren actually
raise her hand.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:51.560
So what I had to do was find the
X and Y position of that

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.380
sprite sheet and then go into
the sprite sheet in Photoshop

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:03.060
and see how many pixels left
and top where the hand is.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:03.700
PETE LEPAGE: Oh wow.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.510
KC AUSTIN: And add that to
the sprite sheet X and Y.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.165
PETE LEPAGE: So you were going,
OK, here's my sprite

00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:11.110
sheet, I know that the
hand ends at this.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.900
KC AUSTIN: And the hand
pixels where I want

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.010
it to form is there.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.380
And then you add that to the
X, Y, Z of the sprite sheet

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.750
and then that places it where
you want it to go.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:27.140
With then you call that on the
WebKit animation iteration.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.480
So when that iteration is done,
the sprite sheet is

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.970
ended, that's when her hand is
up, create the thing, and then

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.890
it just goes by itself.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.300
And you can see it in the
update loop here.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:50.490
This is all the variables
for the set-up.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.255
And if it's left, it sets
the center and border.

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:56.100
If it's right, it sets the
center and border.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:04.210
If it's split, it checks if
its ID is even or odd.

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.515
If it's even, then it goes to
one side, if it's odd, it goes

00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:08.070
to the other.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.730
And if it disperses, it just
takes off, off the screen, and

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.480
doesn't mind the borders.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.700
It's a very simple
particle system.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.850
But for this, we had to
update it on every

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:20.350
frame with the interval.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:25.380
AUBREY ANDERSON: And then, let's
look at the CSS as well

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.400
just as kind of see how they
get bound together.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.435
Because the fireflies
themselves have a--

00:24:32.435 --> 00:24:35.680
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, they also have
an animation on them.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.870
And the CSS animation is
to make them blink.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.470
AUBREY ANDERSON: So each of
these elements, every time you

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.330
add a div, you give it the class
firefly, it's going to

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:48.960
obey these directions here, and
bind itself to the firefly

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.800
light animation.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.260
And it'll do this independently
of whatever

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.290
JavaScript is doing to the div
that actually contains them.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.840
This bit just keeps
running on a loop.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.490
KC AUSTIN: And since they're
created at different times,

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.210
then they blink at
different times.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.510
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, these
will all go from zero.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.420
Animations are also interesting
in the sense that

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:12.460
when the element is visible,
the animation runs.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.860
But they'll clean
themselves up.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.650
If you set the elements to
display none, the animation

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.013
stops and unloads.

00:25:19.013 --> 00:25:20.690
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, cool.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.610
AUBREY ANDERSON: So we were sort
of pleasantly surprised

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.950
by how much management
you get.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.720
We never have to go in and
cancel the information.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.930
KC AUSTIN: Like for the bubbles
for example, when we

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.450
would create the bubble, it
would play the animation.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:38.410
And then on WebKit end, we were
settings display to none,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.960
that would clear
the animation.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.570
PETE LEPAGE: Then it's
not taking up memory.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:44.120
Something like this--

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.330
KC AUSTIN: It's not on
the render queue.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.400
PETE LEPAGE: --if every piece
of bark on some of these

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.630
things is its own element--

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.800
KC AUSTIN: Oh yeah,
it gets heavy.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.960
PETE LEPAGE: --you got
to start thinking

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.455
about a lot of usage.

00:25:52.455 --> 00:25:55.620
KC AUSTIN: Or if you're
generating bubbles every

00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:01.470
second, the divs start
piling up.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.880
Actually for the bubbles, on
WebKit end I was actually

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.280
removing the div.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.050
AUBREY ANDERSON: Oh right,
when the animation ends,

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.130
[INAUDIBLE], you can just
take the div out.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.260
PETE LEPAGE: And there's an
event that's fired when the

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:13.470
animation--

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:15.606
PETE LEPAGE: --oh, that event.

00:26:15.606 --> 00:26:17.520
AUBREY ANDERSON: Both transition
and animation get a

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.580
start and an end.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.240
And animations get an iteration,
which means that

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.080
like if it's looping over
a second, you'll get an

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.685
iteration called [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.685 --> 00:26:28.420
You can actually fake a
setTimeout that way.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.180
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, very nice.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.640
AUBREY ANDERSON: I didn't say
that and I don't recommend it.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.700
PETE LEPAGE: Now, actually
that's a good point.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.450
I assume you guys used
requestAnimationFrame as

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.470
opposed to setTimeout for?

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.120
AUBREY ANDERSON: We ended up
using setTimeout for almost

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.800
everything, primarily for
compatibility's sake.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.670
Because requestAnimationFrame,
I think, is cooler and better

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.730
objectively speaking.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.980
PETE LEPAGE: Absolutely.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.810
AUBREY ANDERSON: Obviously this
is a Chrome experiment,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.115
but we wanted to be as
compatible as possible when

00:26:55.115 --> 00:26:57.230
you took it to another
environment.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:02.900
And not all environments speak
requestAnimationFrame, with

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.830
some notable exceptions.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.770
And then in testing also,
I did a bunch of sort of

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:14.090
parallel testing in terms of
setting timeouts that way,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.550
setting them with animation,
setting them with setTimeouts.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.580
The main thing about setTimeout
is that you just

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.410
have to be really careful
that you don't

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:21.720
leave anybody hanging.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.310
So when you view tears down,
you just have to make sure

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.170
that any time you set a timeout
you keep a reference

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:31.050
to it, and as your view tears
down, you cancel.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.390
And I think timeout has got such
a bad name for a number

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.360
of reasons, but that's
one of them.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.750
It's very easy to make
terrible mistakes.

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.860
KC AUSTIN: I think we'd prefer
to do the animation frame,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.620
because it is clocked
like exactly.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.850
But for this kind of stuff
too, it's just fireflies

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.360
flying around the screen, it
doesn't have to be perfectly

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:56.740
precise at exactly 60 frames
a second or exactly

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:57.450
whatever you need.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:00.830
So as long as they move around
realistically, the interval

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.910
works fine, as long as
you clear it after.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.280
AUBREY ANDERSON: And
for us, there's

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.940
so much media happening.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.970
So a lot of times, our timing,
the holder of the master clock

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.700
is actually a piece of video
or a piece of music.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:18.811
So if you look at like the
tree, for instance.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.480
PETE LEPAGE: And just as a
reminder, if people have

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.330
questions, please go and post
those on Google Moderator so

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.510
we can come back to some of
these in a little bit.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.160
And as well, you can go visit
this at MoviKantiRevo.com.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.370
It's available as
of last night.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.710
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
I heard it launched.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.402
PETE LEPAGE: Woo-hoo.

00:28:41.402 --> 00:28:42.980
Yay.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.990
AUBREY ANDERSON: So in this one,
we have one big animation

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.380
which is transforming the
whole model, essentially

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.980
creating a pan up effect.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.390
But we're not really panning
up, obviously.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:55.860
One big div containing
everything is actually

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.680
animation down very slowly.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.760
And then there's all these sort
of individual pieces of

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.610
video that we're listening to,
specific events, the start,

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.120
the end, and, in some cases,
various timing events.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.890
So there's multiple things
happening, but there's no

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:10.220
setTimeouts in this context.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.110
We're looking at how much time
has elapsed in the animation

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.630
and how much time has elapsed
in a given piece of media.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.220
And those things are keeping
time for us.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.450
The advantage there is if for
some reason somebody hits this

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.570
on a slow network connection and
the video takes an extra

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.430
five seconds to start, obviously
you don't want your

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.150
timing to get all messed up.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.160
So pretty much up to lean on the
video to kind of run the

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.320
clock and tell you what's
happening when.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.150
KC AUSTIN: We also have a simple
queue point script in

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:45.240
there that tracks the video on
video update and tracks what

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:45.850
time it is.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:51.370
And then you have an array that
has times and functions

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.640
that fire during those times.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.490
So as soon as it hits those
times, it will fire those

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.220
functions off.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.340
So you can bring up the video,
see what time exactly you want

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.120
that to fire.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.480
Like on the curtain, when she
leans, we need to trigger the

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.910
curtain to open.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:12.270
So we just say at five seconds,
trigger the current

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.320
left, and then it'll
fire that.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.320
AUBREY ANDERSON: One of the
things I'd love to see happen

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.480
in the media tags, in general,
is some sort of a better way

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.120
to plug into what's happening
in the media world.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.090
Like a of times, we have to
manually set up a framework to

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.710
observe a piece of media.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:33.030
The media tells us a lot when
it's loading and about whether

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.420
it can play or can't play.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.285
Once it's rolling, it's kind
of quiet unless you ask it,

00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:39.960
and basically just go
in and getTime.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.600
You get the element and ask
it for current time.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.660
And current time will give
you seconds and sometimes

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.390
milliseconds.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.090
And then you have to kind of
infer from what's going on.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.870
But it'd be great to have that
API get deeper someday and be

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.443
able to have the media tell us
and create callbacks that we

00:30:59.443 --> 00:31:00.870
can listen for.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.450
It's very new, it's very
young, so there's a

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.850
lot going on there.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.530
PETE LEPAGE: I think there's
so many opportunities.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:12.020
We've got like the now with
the Web Audio API.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:15.160
Hopefully we'll be able to get
something potentially similar

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.400
sort of for video that we'll
be able to get a lot more

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.160
stuff with.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.680
AUBREY ANDERSON: Oh yeah,
and we had high hopes.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.870
Obviously, we're using Web
Audio and WebRTC in this.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.550
But one of the things we ran
into, which I think just got

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.390
fixed in Canary, like yesterday,
was the ability to

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.170
essentially loop those
things back and plug

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.880
them into one another.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.970
Which you wouldn't think would
be that big a deal, but it's

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.450
actually a super, super
important when creating things

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.420
like voice control.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:54.920
So what we had hoped to
accomplish here was to allow

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.490
us to listen to the camera
and microphone.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.570
And obviously, we're painting
the camera frames

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:05.150
in here with a canvas.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.030
But the audio, we cannot, or
at least have not been able

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.100
to, sort of feed that back into
the Web Audio API and

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.100
analyze it.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.820
Our sort of dream for some of
these sections was she would

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.060
come up and ask you to whistle,
you would whistle, we

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.650
would look at the frequency and
use Web Audio to sort of

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.900
analyze whether you had hit a
certain frequency range, and

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.520
create different behaviors
based on low tone, a high

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.150
tone, a loud sound,
a quiet sound.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.350
And that's something that I
think we will get to as we go.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.810
But it's really exciting to see
that kind of come about.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.390
And there was a bug filed
about it already.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.590
But we jumped on the bug and
we're like, well we're trying

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.610
to do this, and this,
and this.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.470
And then we saw other people
kind of go, oh yeah, we want

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:47.610
to do that too.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.910
So I think it built some
momentum and has now actually

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:52.610
been sorted out.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:55.590
PETE LEPAGE: So let's talk about
the facial detection,

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.800
getUserMedia, and what's
going on there.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.240
Because you start Movi Kanti
Revo for the first time and it

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.000
says, hey, this application
wants to use your webcam and

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.910
microphone, do you
want to allow?

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.260
And you click Yes, and all of
a sudden, there's your face.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.380
What's going on there?

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.810
AUBREY ANDERSON: So there's a
bunch of stuff going on there.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:19.480
The first thing happens is
when you click Allow, it

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.820
creates a video tag.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.070
And it sets the source of that
video tag to whatever

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.480
WebRTC gives you.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.980
WebRTC gives you this sort of
string of gobbledygook, which

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.432
is really just a kind of a
reference, I think, so that

00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:34.290
the system can bind
up to the feed

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.130
coming in from the camera.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.330
But that's really
only step one.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.050
The video tag doesn't get you
very far in terms of doing

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.360
motion tracking or anything
like that.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.670
To do that, you really
need to use canvas,

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.770
at least right now.

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.860
So you never actually see the
video that we bring in.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.390
The first thing you see
is a canvas element.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.300
This canvas element has some
sort of vignetting going on

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.410
and some other treatments,
which is why I'm sort of

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:00.510
partially transparent here.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.770
But the sort of meat of what's
happening is that the frames

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.810
from the video are getting
pulled into the canvas, we're

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.690
then blowing through
the pixel.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:14.840
The pixels of the canvas gives
you a sort of big and

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.909
unfortunately convoluted
pixel array.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.420
So it's actually just a big
single list of pixels.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:27.090
And pixels 0, 1 2, and 3, are
the R, G, B, and A of the

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.750
first pixel.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.739
Those are the first
four slots.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:35.830
So you have to take the slots
of the array, four by four,

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:39.219
and just make a note for
yourself that every four means

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:43.605
a pixel, and start your start to
pixel-level analysis there

00:34:43.605 --> 00:34:45.969
and that way.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.270
So we're using a couple
of things.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:53.330
One is this really fantastic,
and reasonably fast JavaScript

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.775
CCV library to recognize face.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.590
It's very fast, but it's still
JavaScript, so it's

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.590
comparatively slow to
like native code.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:07.870
So every second or so, we do
face detection and average out

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.480
the things like the size and
the location of your face.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.520
And so, if you kind of lean it,
it's keyed to zoom, and

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.880
that will sort of trigger
the zoom in.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.800
Leaning out will sort
of push out, again,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.460
with the zoom level.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.320
And then from there, we're just
looking at what I think

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.955
of as pretty traditional
motion detection.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.040
And Jason who's not here wrote
this, and he's very smart.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:39.040
So it blows through pixels, it
looks at an interval, it looks

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.380
at what that pixel looked like
last time it checked and what

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.100
it looks like now.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.950
And so it's a threshold
for a difference.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.970
So if that pixel is these
different enough, that is the

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.130
color or the tone has changed
past a certain threshold, we

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.310
call that motion.

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.950
So that means there's
something happening.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.930
There's some places where
that falls down.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.880
But actually, in practice,
especially with a laptop or

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.730
whatever sitting on the table,
it's pretty darn accurate, and

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.190
actually very, very fast.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.850
Fast enough for where this is
probably 15 or 18 frames per

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.870
second, and we're still doing
all this other stuff, and 3D

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.290
transforms, and animations
and stuff.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.030
So we're definitely beating
up the JavaScript

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.530
run time pretty badly.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:21.386
But it's OK, it actually runs.

00:36:21.386 --> 00:36:22.650
PETE LEPAGE: We're pushing
the browser pretty hard.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.410
KC AUSTIN: And we threw
everything else onto the GPU

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:26.920
with the translate 3D.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:33.450
So that frees up all the CPU
that we can this other stuff.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.970
AUBREY ANDERSON: It's that
sort of balance.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.600
Anything that you can say, here,
graphics card, and get

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.040
it out of--

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.580
PETE LEPAGE: You go do this.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.570
AUBREY ANDERSON: I mean this
is a huge difference.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.640
This is sort of a tangent.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.200
But like the way we used to do
it with JavaScript, or like if

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.900
you do jquery.animate, or
anything that is essentially

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.440
clock-based animation where
JavaScript is setting timeouts

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.540
or running an interval and
observing elements.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.340
It's just dog slow compared to,
an even with a very fast

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:04.530
JavaScript run time, it's that
sort of single-threaded like

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.330
JavaScript has to think
about every frame.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.950
Which, I think there's 150
lanterns, there's this

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.920
background animation happening,
there are all these

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.055
elements positioned in 3D space,
the canvas analysis,

00:37:18.055 --> 00:37:21.660
the video coming in, there's
a lot going on

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.410
even in this one page.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.390
PETE LEPAGE: So I think that
one of the things that just

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:30.180
sort of blew me away with the
getUserMedia and WebRTC is

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.780
like you get access to the
camera, of course, user's

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.095
permission first.

00:37:35.095 --> 00:37:38.350
You then take that, render that
onto canvas, you can do

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:39.540
whatever you want with
it from there.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.090
It's not going anywhere.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.530
All that video's sitting
on your local machine.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:48.360
So you're doing all that
analysis there.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.680
And then being able to make an
entire scene and the world

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.490
move about in that way.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:59.720
So as your head goes one way,
you start to tilt the world.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.600
To go back to the 3D transforms
we were talking

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.330
about earlier, you start
applying those.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.420
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, in the
real app we have thresholds on

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:07.330
these 3D transforms.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.260
I've turned them off for the
sake of this demo so you can

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.280
see and spin the whole model
all the way around.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.890
PETE LEPAGE: Is that something
that developers

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.500
can go do very easily?

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.780
Is there a place with dev
tools they can go?

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.190
KC AUSTIN: There was one
variable author mode that

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.790
turned it on.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:25.420
But since, you'd have to just
take one condition out.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.340
But yeah, it's just
one condition.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.010
AUBREY ANDERSON:
It's tweakable.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.643
Maybe I'll send it to you and
you can post it somewhere.

00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.590
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that
would be kind of cool.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.540
Because it really is one
of those fun things for

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.930
developers to go, oh, hey,
I want to take this part.

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.510
I want to see what's going on
behind each of these pieces.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.960
AUBREY ANDERSON: And you don't
even have to do that by

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.690
tweaking variables.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:49.380
You can actually go into the
inspector and just change the

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.010
translate 3D state
of the element.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.290
And almost all the
elements here are

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.280
transform in 3D space.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.010
And so you can just go in and
change the rotate Y value and

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.630
or add a rotate Y value if
it doesn't have one.

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.620
And you'll see it do this.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.180
KC AUSTIN: You do to force
perspective container and go

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.630
into the X, Y, Z of that.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.410
And you can sort of do
whatever you want.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:13.930
AUBREY ANDERSON:
Move it around.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.160
PETE LEPAGE: See how
that happens.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.166
AUBREY ANDERSON: I like that
you get to see the back

00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:18.350
of the video too.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.642
You don't have to have this,
but we've left it on just

00:39:20.642 --> 00:39:22.380
because it's kind of cool.

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:24.600
PETE LEPAGE: Well, that
was one of the things.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.120
I don't think we ended
up doing it.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.460
But I remember us talking about
it at one point, was

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.630
like an Easter egg where like
if you actually turned the

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:34.420
scene around all the way, you
actually would see sort of

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.610
back, like almost backstage
kind of thing.

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.560
AUBREY ANDERSON:
Yeah, totally.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.480
We had kind of a long list of
extra wonderful things that

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.970
time is always against
you in trying to

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.730
actually ship something.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.230
But yeah, there are
several little

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.390
things if you dig around.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.890
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.040
AUBREY ANDERSON: I'm not
giving them all way.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.490
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, we definitely
don't want.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.790
We've given one good one.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.330
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
there's at least one

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.630
good one we gave away.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.230
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.250
So one of the other things that
we thought about with

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:06.060
this experiment was mobile
experiences, right?

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.420
Do you want to talk a
little bit about how

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.380
you approached that?

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.990
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, I guess
there's another sort of

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.930
important side effect to letting
CSS do a lot of this

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.310
heavy lifting for you.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.280
One is obviously it's
just easier on the

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.870
JavaScript run time.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.545
But the other kind
of cool thing is

00:40:23.545 --> 00:40:25.030
that it's very portable.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.850
So any other browser runtime
that thinks about things this

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:33.730
way will allow you to render
these elements on the GPU of

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.820
whatever device you happen
to be looking at.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:42.430
And so we're kind of fortunate
to be coming into an era where

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:45.560
a lot of browsers speak the
same, or at least subtle

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.580
variance of the same language,
and will do the same things

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.020
with those instructions, so
particularly animations and

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.470
transforms.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:41:01.310
So as we set something like
transform translate 3D, we now

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.650
have support for this in pretty
much, at least the

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:09.580
latest releases of, all major
browsers and mobile.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.090
And in the mobile space it is
particularly important because

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.150
obviously your CPU is pegged
down quite a bit.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:18.030
You're generally running
on sometimes dual core.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.060
Now but it's still
100 megahertz.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.000
And its a phone, it's also doing
whatever the phone needs

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.680
to do, and there's
a lot going, it's

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.220
not just the browser.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.000
And so the ability to take
elements in the browser and

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.200
render them on the graphics
hardware is really, really

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.740
huge and really important.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.600
And if you look at this
experience on tablets, you

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.290
actually get pretty competent
rendering, and, in some cases,

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:43.870
really kickass rendering just by
virtue of this same thing.

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.220
And places where we don't have
a really good JavaScript run

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.650
time, we can dodge that to some
extent by rendering right

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.130
on the hardware.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.580
PETE LEPAGE: Now we don't have
getUserMedia on mobile.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.580
So instead, it did something I
thought was brilliant and it

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.760
makes perfect sense.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:05.350
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, what we
did on mobile is we pegged

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:07.410
that behavior to tilt.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:10.670
So as you tilt, you'll see this
kind of interface here,

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:14.336
which is like a little
four-way controller.

00:42:14.336 --> 00:42:18.400
This is a poor man's D-pad.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:24.260
And as you tilt, you will get
the sort of same effect as if

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.750
we detected motion on the
left and right side.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.316
PETE LEPAGE: So tilt device
orientation, so that as you

00:42:30.316 --> 00:42:32.960
tilt the device it gets
that same thing.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.260
And it's pretty rare that I'm
going to pick up my laptop or

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.265
desktop and go, oo, look,
I can do this.

00:42:40.265 --> 00:42:43.860
I've done it A. Few times for
a quick little demo and it's

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.620
kind of fun.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:47.810
But you're not going to give
your kid your laptop and say,

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.956
hey, go play with Movi Kanti
Revo and tilt it.

00:42:50.956 --> 00:42:54.060
So it doesn't work there, but
it works so beautifully on

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:58.840
mobile where people just
naturally think, oh, cool.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.450
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, we tried
to on mobile side do the

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.100
thing that you would think
that it would do to the

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:09.570
greatest extent that we could,
so wherever possible just

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.850
tried to do the right
thing and the thing

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.590
that you might expect.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:16.710
KC AUSTIN: We have sort of this
higher level thing that

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.820
makes it lean either way, and
then that will accept input

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:20.820
from wherever you want.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.260
So if it's the widget that has
the video stuff, that'll tell

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:28.450
it, or the tilt, or whatever
else we wanted.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.180
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, you can
really map any input into the

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:35.820
general rotation controller and
wire up whatever type of

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:36.750
control you want.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:41.200
So you could easily wire
it touch, or keyboard.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.450
PETE LEPAGE: So we could even,
like, game pack controllers.

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:44.725
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
we could do game pack

00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:45.560
controllers.

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.765
PETE LEPAGE: HTML5 has got the
API for doing that, so like

00:43:47.765 --> 00:43:50.160
you could [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.430
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, there's
some potential there.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:52.540
PETE LEPAGE: That would
be really fun.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.300
That would be really
net to go do.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.850
We've been playing with one
for our Chrome Apps.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.470
We've got one of the Parrot
Drone helicopters.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:04.530
And we managed to make it fly
using purely HTML and

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.200
JavaScript with a Chrome
App, which is like tons

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.790
of fun to go to.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.120
I'm going to start pull up some
of the questions to see

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.520
if people have submitted
stuff.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.165
But what was your favorite
part of this project?

00:44:19.165 --> 00:44:19.810
AUBREY ANDERSON: I don't know.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.060
Do you have a favorite part?

00:44:24.386 --> 00:44:27.520
KC AUSTIN: Just overall,
probably just getting to the

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:32.460
point where I can be creative
without having to think about

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:35.380
the CSS, and all the code
and everything.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.180
Getting to a point where I can
set things up, get things

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.090
moving around, build these
scenes out without thinking

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:42.920
about the code anymore.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.170
I think that's the best thing,
when you finally get to the

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.870
point where you're not thinking
about how things

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:48.480
should be set up.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.560
Because we went to so many
iterations of do we do CSS

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.400
animations, do we do JavaScript,
how do we have the

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.950
scenes set up in 3D?

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.910
Once you get to the point
where all that kind of

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.480
workflow is all settled, and
then you can take the assets

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.850
from getting build something
at the end, I think

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:08.590
that's the best part.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.570
AUBREY ANDERSON: I really
liked also when we were

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.090
shooting in Las Vegas.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.590
We had a lot of these models
or at least preliminary

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.730
versions of the models built.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:23.130
And so we were able to take
really quick keys from the

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.280
camera and just make me
quick movie files.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.910
And they were sort of res'ed
out and stuff, but we were

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:34.790
able to drop those right into
the environment as we had them

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:39.760
mocked up and show the actors,
show the performers what they

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.480
were going to look like
in the environment.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.050
And they were like, ah, OK,
I see, so I'm in a forest.

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:47.210
And I think when they went
back and did another take

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:51.970
after seeing it, I think it
changed their idea, and it

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.540
gave them a real sense of
what was happening.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.650
And I think it changed the
quality of the performance

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.100
because they could actually
previsualized.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.190
PETE LEPAGE: Well they were
in this blue screen room.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:05.160
Like literally it was this
cube of just pure blue.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.610
And it's hard to imagine in that
without having something

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:11.630
to start with where
you're going.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.690
KC AUSTIN: And mocking the
scenes up and just having

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.120
layers is really fast.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.280
So you could just have that set
up, throw them in, show

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.870
them how it looks, even change
stuff on the fly.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.730
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, move
things up and down in Z space,

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:23.920
scale things around.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.090
And because it's all CSS and
you're not down there making a

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.970
code level change and forgetting
a semicolon or

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:31.750
whatever, it's very, very quick
and easy to change.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.750
You can change it right
in the inspector.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.875
It was, I would say, my first
experience with something that

00:46:36.875 --> 00:46:41.460
was that real time with that
kind of media production.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, and to see
them all come over and look at

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.320
this, like they were
just so amazed.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.690
And in fact, some of the artists
were at the launch

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.180
last night.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.950
Like we've been heads
down in this.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:54.750
We've seen this--

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.800
AUBREY ANDERSON: They'd
never seen it.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.700
PETE LEPAGE: --hours, and hours,
and hours a day, and

00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.400
they had never seen it.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.820
And the look of sort of joy,
and glee, and excitement on

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.770
their face to see them in this
world was pretty phenomenal.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.660
AUBREY ANDERSON: Right on.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.010
I had to talk, I missed that.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:09.890
But I'm glad that happened.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.390
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.900
So a couple questions
from the audience.

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:18.060
And please post anymore as we're
going through these.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:26.570
But the first question was,
somebody tried to run it on

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:31.060
some of the older browsers, so
like Firefox 3.6, and IE 9,

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.980
and it doesn't degrade
gracefully.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:40.870
And besides WebRTC not working,
why didn't it work in

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:43.500
those older browsers?

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.490
AUBREY ANDERSON: The big barrier
is the ability to

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.630
translate elements
in 3D space.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:53.480
And sort of early on we were
like, well, if we do it this

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.380
way, we are going to
lose some of the

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.100
older browser renderers.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.420
But this being a Chrome
experiment, we wanted to

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.460
really show the latest, greatest
and do the really

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.930
best we could do with the
technology that we have on the

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.400
sort of leading edge.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.740
Not that WebKit transform is
particularly, but broad

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:18.340
support is pretty new.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.090
So the big barrier for older
browsers is that they will not

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.860
translate elements
in 3D space.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:29.340
A lot of them have translate Y,
they have translate X, or

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:35.290
they have a translate function
that takes an X and a Y, but

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:39.840
there's no Z. And they also
don't do that work

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.840
largely on the GPU.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.460
So the barrier for us was a
browser run time that when you

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:51.090
ask it to put an element,
position it in 3D space, it

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:54.190
would do that for you, and do
the right thing, and hopefully

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.990
do it on the graphics card
wherever possible.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:00.350
So you'll see this on Windows XP
as well, like Chrome ships

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:04.650
with acceleration turned off
by default on Windows XP.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.970
And so even though Chrome can
do it, they, I think, can't

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:12.080
reliably be certain of the GPU
environment, so they hedge the

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.430
bet and ship it off.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.260
You can go into about:flags
and turn it back on.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.480
But the browser that can't speak
that language, we had to

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.620
just let those ones go.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.210
KC AUSTIN: Or even you could
have the newest version of

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:26.700
Chrome but with a super old GPU,
it just won't know what

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.250
to do with those layers.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.680
PETE LEPAGE: And one of the
really important things about

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.850
Chrome experiments is they are
meant push the web forward and

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:37.490
show what's possible
on the web.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:40.640
And that's sort of one of those
things where this works

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:46.570
in many, almost all of the
modern browsers without any

00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.230
craziness going on.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.450
And so we want to push that.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:53.420
We want people to look at this
and go, holy smokes, this is

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.890
all HTML, I can do
this myself.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.520
I can go in and look this.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.890
There's nothing proprietary.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:02.630
You can view source on
the code on this.

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.000
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, and
change the whole thing.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.620
And I mean, I think it's also
important to really understand

00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:08.610
that this is an art piece.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.140
I mean, we're not
trying to sell

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:13.950
refrigerators from this website.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:18.090
Like we're trying to do creative
work with new tools

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:20.840
that we have discovered
in modern browsers.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:24.140
And that's, I think, the
experiment part of the Chrome

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:26.210
experiment.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:29.490
We're fundamentally pretty
creative people, and that's

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.580
where our hearts
and minds are.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.930
We're also technical.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:38.030
But the point of this whole
process was to take the tools

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:41.160
that we have discovered in the
browser, push them as hard as

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.640
we could in the name
of doing something

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.220
artistic and creative.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:46.930
PETE LEPAGE: Cool, awesome.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:51.900
The next question, was it easier
to do this in HTML and

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.400
JavaScript than it
was in Flash?

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.662
AUBREY ANDERSON: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:50:56.662 --> 00:50:59.730
PETE LEPAGE: And we talked last
night, you came from a

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:00.570
Flash world.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:04.420
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, I've been in
the Flash world since '98.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.200
I helped shape the plug-in.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.040
I've been working on it for
years, and years, and years.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.490
And it's not so much a
matter of could we do

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.110
it better in Flash.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:21.050
Flash has all kinds of different
effects, and

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.160
filters, and everything
but [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.830
level stuff.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:27.190
And you do get the webcam across
all browsers, which

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.670
would be great.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:33.390
But it's more the point of being
challenging and doing it

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:36.310
without Flash.

00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:37.510
And this is the future.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:41.150
So I think we have to push it.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:44.070
And eventually, we will
have everything

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:45.430
that we have in Flash.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.140
We already have the
CSS filters now.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:52.680
With canvas we're getting
bitmap level effects.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:56.480
So it's getting there and we
just need to push it forward

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.760
until it is 100%.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.750
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, and I think
this is something that we will

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.820
absolutely get to.

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.420
And this is something that is,
I think, in many ways, much

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.960
more accessible to people.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.030
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, and if you
say, we could have had the

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:15.000
microphone in Flash, and we
actually thought about having

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.130
just one element just to grab
the microphone and pipe it in

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:19.450
just from Flash.

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:22.390
But we decided against it just
because we wanted it to be

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.090
complete a complete
HTML5 experience.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:30.510
And now, yesterday, we do have
audio in Canary, and because

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.430
of the fact that we're
pushing it forward.

00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:35.880
So the next thing that we
do, we will have that.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.060
AUBREY ANDERSON: I also think
it's really important that

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.760
this is markup.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.100
We're doing things
declaratively, by and large,

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.550
in this application, which is

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.800
fundamentally a different idea.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.300
KC AUSTIN: It was a paradigm
shift for me to work in this.

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.160
I have a very like
game programming

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.560
mentality in Flash.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.060
And I have the way that
I set things up

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.400
is completely different.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.784
And Aubrey had to kind of turn
everything on its head for me.

00:53:05.784 --> 00:53:08.390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:09.870
PETE LEPAGE: So he had to apply
that 3D transform--

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:11.609
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
to your brain.

00:53:11.609 --> 00:53:12.970
PETE LEPAGE: --and
then rotate.

00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.930
KC AUSTIN: So I had to like
change things around

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.690
completely and get back into
that markup, CSS, JavaScript

00:53:18.690 --> 00:53:19.800
kind of mentality.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.730
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.690
So the next question, what kind
of DOM and JS cleanup did

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.350
you do to keep the performance
and memory leaks to a minimum?

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:31.900
As the user stays in
this experience,

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:33.430
like it runs 10 minutes.

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:34.970
KC AUSTIN: It has to clean
up everything.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.760
You have to clean up
all the intervals.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:43.850
And the Neutrino with like
setting display to none after

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.580
the pages are done.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.980
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, we were
working within a framework

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:50.340
that we also invented
call Neutrino.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:55.280
And what that does is just gives
you a simple lifestyle--

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.550
life cycle.

00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.930
Also, some lifestyle management,
but mostly life

00:53:58.930 --> 00:53:59.450
cycle management.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.030
PETE LEPAGE: That would
be a pretty phenomenal

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.870
framework to have.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.540
AUBREY ANDERSON: It comes
with a hat and some cool

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.310
sunglasses.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.880
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome,
sign me up.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:13.640
AUBREY ANDERSON: It's a tool
that allows you to think in

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.230
terms of a kind of atomic
modular views.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:19.070
And the views have a life cycle,
they become visible,

00:54:19.070 --> 00:54:21.520
they become invisible.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.600
And it just helps you manage
some of that stuff.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.820
Our friend in this situation
is display none.

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:35.100
So what we found in browsers is
display none takes it out

00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.370
of the memory stock.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.360
So then you just have to be
careful about what JavaScript

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.270
is doing, make sure that
JavaScript is not running

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.850
away, or you don't have
an interval or a

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.080
timeout still running.

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.240
But by and large, if you are
animating with WebKit

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.460
animation for with transforms,
and you set display none on

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:02.280
any block of HTML, from there
all the way down the stack in

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.255
the DOM is just yanked.

00:55:04.255 --> 00:55:06.630
And it's yanked actually
fairly quickly.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:10.350
And you get the memory back
almost immediately.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.650
So obviously each of these
scenes has hundreds and

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:16.740
hundreds of things going on.

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:19.150
They're massive, they're
transparent PNG files, they're

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.020
video files, and all
those things.

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.200
And so setting display none to a
whole block, we can actually

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.860
leave it in the DOM.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.790
In some cases, we do, some
cases, we don't.

00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:31.630
KC AUSTIN: Yeah, I was doing
some cleanup where on WebKit

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:33.930
end I would actually remove
the HTML element.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:37.330
But that was more just
for me, so it wasn't

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:39.382
2,000 divs in the DOM.

00:55:39.382 --> 00:55:40.620
AUBREY ANDERSON:
Yeah, totally.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.160
The one exception, I
think, is video.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.060
Obviously, even display
none on video,

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.020
it's a little squirrely.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:53.070
So you'll see, if you watch
the life cycle in the DOM

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:56.660
happen, just let the thing play,
you'll see video tags

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.760
getting injected, they'll play,
they'll get pulled.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:02.760
So we do try to do some more
aggressive cleanup and

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.240
management on video and
audio in particular.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.780
But for animations and all that
stuff, it's just kind of

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.790
wonderfully managed by virtue
of the view state.

00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:13.170
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:15.570
So we've only got like a
couple minutes left.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:16.700
So I'm going to take
this last question.

00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:18.920
I think it's a wonderful
question.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.800
How would you recommend a web
developer that didn't do any

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.160
animations start using them
in their next app.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.220
Is there a good framework
or library that

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:28.190
they should look at?

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.840
Or is there a set of tools?

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.950
How do they get started?

00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:36.190
AUBREY ANDERSON: Well, I think
HTML5 Rocks is actually a

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:37.240
pretty nice place to start.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:39.250
I'm not just plugging
a Google thing.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:43.370
Like it actually is a nice place
to just step through an

00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:44.320
approach to that.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.310
KC AUSTIN: That's what I was
going through a lot when I

00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:47.890
first started.

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.870
Just go through every one of
those things and just get

00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:53.470
things moving around on screen,
very simple things,

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:57.700
and just build, just kind of
snowball up your tool box.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.770
And go through each of the
functions, check all the

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.660
different timing functions,
durations, all

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:03.330
that kind of stuff.

00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:07.670
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah, you do
need to just jump into it,

00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:11.790
make an animation,
and watch it go.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:15.840
But it's not actually
that complicated.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.040
So in some ways, it's something
that is noble and

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.400
easy to experiment with
and you can just do it

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.710
in HTML in a browser.

00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:28.570
Just inline your CSS and
mess around with stuff.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:29.830
And I'd start very simple.

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.470
Just make yourself a key frame
sequence with a 0% and 100%.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.270
And just apply it and--

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.900
PETE LEPAGE: See what happens.

00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:38.850
AUBREY ANDERSON: Yeah,
you'll sort of feel

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:40.470
your way through it.

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.090
It's like any new technology,
where there's a confused

00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:44.710
couple of hours.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.850
But it is actually really
well-documented, and

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:49.280
increasingly well-documented.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.560
The first couple of years, it
was really, really hard to

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:52.415
find anything.

00:57:52.415 --> 00:57:56.050
But I found, this year in
particular, a huge ramp up in

00:57:56.050 --> 00:57:59.640
examples and copy, paste your
way through to something

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.360
happening, and just start
tweaking things, changing

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:05.510
variables, changing
time, and note.

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:08.420
And you'll go, oh, this is
a good way to do things.

00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:11.850
It takes a minute to just change
your brain around from

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:14.510
thinking of there's a thing, I'm
going to select the thing,

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:16.960
and it's going to happen.

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.370
Largely we key animations to
class states, so you're still

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:22.350
selecting things sometimes
in the run time.

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:26.030
But a lot of times you're just
doing document.queryselector

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.480
some thing, and you're adding a
class to it or subtracting a

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.330
class to it.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.520
PETE LEPAGE: All right,
well I want to

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:33.730
thank you guys so much.

about building the 3D

case studies that we're
