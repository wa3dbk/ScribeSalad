SAURABH GUPTA: Good afternoon,
and welcome to everyone in

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.870
this room and watching on the
Livestream and YouTube.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.470
My name is Saurabh Gupta.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.435
I'm Product Manager of
Google Apps Script.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:13.710
JONATHAN RASCHER: I'm
Jonathan Rascher.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.850
I'm a software engineer
at Google Apps Script.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.410
SAURABH GUPTA: And today, we are
going to show you how you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.955
can extend Google Docs
with Apps Script.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.790
So with a show of hands, how
many of you have heard of

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.020
Google Docs or used
Google Docs?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.280
Almost all of you.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.510
I figured that much.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.650
But for those of you who haven't
or those of you who

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.850
are watching on the Livestream,
Google Docs is a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.000
word processing app
in Google Drive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.230
Using Google Docs, you can
create and share documents

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.510
across devices--

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.150
in your browser, on your iPhone
or Android phone.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.520
And yes, it works even when
you are not connected.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.260
It's really awesome.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.720
But you know what is
even more awesome?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.030
Starting this week,
you can use Apps

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.160
Script in Google Docs.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.826
That's awesome.

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:10.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.740
Thank you.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.450
And for those of you who do not
know what Apps Script is,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.930
well, Apps Script is
the JavaScript

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.920
engine in the cloud.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.540
And it lets you integrate and
automate and make the most out

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.320
of Google Apps.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.170
So you might ask, well, that's
all great and good and yeah,

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.700
you can use the Apps Script in
Google Docs, but what does

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.980
that really mean?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.870
So just to elaborate on that,
let me share a simple story.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.830
And this happened a few months
ago, and Jonathan will

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.870
remember this.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.450
Jonathan and I were hanging out
with our friend, Bob, in a

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.360
bistro a few months ago.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.480
And Bob was talking about
awesome research that he's

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.250
doing and this great research
paper that he's writing.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.990
And we were pretty excited
because we know Bob is a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.560
Google Docs user.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.460
So we were super excited
about that.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.930
And he was going on and
on about his research.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.900
But he had a slight problem.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.600
He said, well, he is referring
to a ton of sources--

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.000
books, journals, articles,
you name it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.240
And he's having a hard
time keeping up.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.690
And what's even more worrying
for him was that he wanted to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.970
make sure that he's citing all
these sources, he's giving

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.810
credit where credit is due.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.950
So this was a genuine
problem for him.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.330
So you know what
happened next?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.390
Well, something that usually
happens when you put a user,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.670
an engineer, and a product
manager on the table.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.520
A napkin comes out, and people
start scribbling stuff.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.250
And that's what we
exactly did.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.020
And we drew something and said,
hey Bob, you need a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.220
bibliography management
app in Google Docs.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.550
And Bob said, yeah, I want to be
able to add sources to it--

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.590
all of those sources
that you just saw.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.860
Not just that, I want to be able
to cite those sources in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.480
my research paper.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.670
And, at the end of it, I want to
have a well-formatted, good

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.650
looking bibliography in
my research paper.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.620
So he said, yes, exactly.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.850
This a great use case.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.400
And right after the dinner,
Jonathan and I went back to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.860
the office and said, hey, we've
got to build our friend

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.000
Bob this app.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.490
And that's what we
exactly did.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.320
And you know what we built?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.960
We built an app called Bibstro
using Google Apps Script.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.690
And then you will ask,
why Bibstro?

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.560
Well, it's obvious.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.525
In the moment of sobriety, we
were sitting in a bistro, and

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:31.070
we thought about

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.160
bibliographies, so why not Bibstro?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.980
But the important thing here
is that this app is built

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.560
using Google Apps Script.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.580
And what we are going to show
you here in the next two

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.190
minutes is a demo of Bibstro.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.750
And the point of the demo
is that you can

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.940
build your own app.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.090
And we hope to give you some
insights into how you can

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.930
build your own app
in Google Docs.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.180
So let's get to the demo.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.560
This is Google Docs, and this
is Bob's research paper.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.480
And as you can see, on the Menu
left of Help, is a menu

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.430
item called Bibstro.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.760
So the first thing that
Bob needs to do is

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.420
configure this app.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.200
And so he clicks on Bibstro,
and he clicks on Settings.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.519
And you can see there
is a submenu, and

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.950
he clicks on Configure.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.740
And up comes a form, and he
chooses a citation format, and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.300
he configures the app.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.740
That's pretty straightforward.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.400
The next thing, if you remember
from the napkin that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.990
I was talking about, was he
needs to add sources--

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.180
all of those list of papers
and journals and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.490
all of those articles.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.380
So he clicks on Bibstro, clicks
on Add Source, and up

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.550
comes another form.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.000
And you can see how
well-formatted and good

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.180
looking UI it is.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
And he starts adding all of
these sources in this app.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.820
And he collects a list of
sources, and a bibliography

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.700
gets generated for it.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.020
So he adds a source, and the
next thing he does is he

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.560
scrolls all the way to the
bottom of the document and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.310
sees that, hey, here's
this bibliography--

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.210
well-formatted according to the
standard that he chose,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.950
and it's right there.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.000
So that's awesome.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.760
That's cool.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.540
So he gets a bibliography.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.460
He is able to add sources.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.470
The next thing he wants to do is
be able to cite the source.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.010
So he scrolls up in his
document, locates the cursor

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.640
wherever he wants to cite the
source, then clicks on the

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.380
menu item Bibstro and clicks
on Add Inline Citation.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.140
And now he can choose from any
of the source and cite that

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.100
source right in the document.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.820
So this is awesome, and
you can see the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.550
source is now cited.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.510
So we met all of Bob's
requirements and built this

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.860
app using Google Apps Script.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.980
But Bob is our friend, and we
wanted to throw in a little

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.110
bit of extra.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.000
So the extra that we wanted to
throw in was, hey, what if Bob

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.280
wants to see where a particular
source is

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.560
cited in the doc?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.910
So we built a capability
called Manage Sources.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.050
So Bob clicks on, again, Bibstro
and says, OK, I want

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.360
to manage a source.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.920
And up comes on the right side
a panel which shows a list of

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.770
all of Bob's sources.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.310
And here, Bob can just say,
OK, I want to highlight a

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.420
particular source.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.750
And you can see a source
is highlighted.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.450
And he can remove the source
if he wants and do all of

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.980
these kinds of interesting
things.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.740
But the one last thing that is
pretty interesting is that he

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.840
can scroll all the way to the
bottom of his bibliography and

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.255
say he just plays
around with it.

00:06:37.255 --> 00:06:39.210
Say he corrupts it
or something.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.060
Then he can just click on
Refresh, and a bibliography

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.570
gets refreshed.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.240
So that's a very simple demo of
a type of app you can build

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.770
in Google Docs using
Apps Script.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.080
And we want to make sure that
yes, your app is also as

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.770
awesome as this one using
Google Apps Script.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.760
So let's get started.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.310
How do you build an
app like that?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.630
Or rather, how did
we build Bibstro?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.980
So there are four steps
in building Bibstro.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.470
The first step is that you
want to be able to create

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.650
scripts using the Script
Editor in Google Docs.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.790
So this is Google Docs.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.220
You can see the Tools
menu is expanded.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.160
And in the Tools menu,
you will see

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.680
two new menu options--

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.310
the Script Editor and
the Script Manager.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.290
Using the Script Editor, you
can create container-bound

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.730
scripts to Google Docs.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.190
And you can learn a lot about
container-bound scripts on our

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.900
developer documentation.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.496
But the crux of it is that these
scripts live and die

00:07:50.496 --> 00:07:51.640
with the document.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.630
So this is the starting point.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.820
You want to be able to create
scripts in Document.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.640
What's next?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.410
The second thing is you want
to identify how you want to

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.880
plug your app into the
UI of Google Docs.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.100
So again, this is Google Docs.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.990
And anything that you want to
do with Google Docs always

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.960
starts with this class
called DocumentApp.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.510
If there is one thing that I
want you to take away from

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:22.090
this session, it's this-- that
DocumentApp is your starting

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:28.250
point in building apps
for Google Docs.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.080
So this is Google Docs.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.610
And what you see highlighted
is the menu, or the UI.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.669
And it's very simple.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.110
If you want to get a handle to
the UI of Google Docs, just

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.260
call DocumentApp.getUi.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.320
It's that simple.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.350
And then I'm going to show you
some amazing things that you

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:44.555
can do with the UI.

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:49.030
So first up is inserting a menu,
and it's pretty simple.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.060
As you can see on the code
on the right, that

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.140
DocumentApp.getUi.createMenu,
and you can create a top level

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.320
menu, then add items to it.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.060
And you can even add
submenus and so on.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.360
But the idea is that
DocumentApp.getUi gives you a

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.150
handle to the different UI
aspects of Google Docs.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.980
So adding a menu is great.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.080
What's next?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.980
Showing your app in a sidebar.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:19.870
Now, if your app shows up in
sidebar, that's great, because

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.310
what users get with this is the
opportunity to use your

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.620
app while they're working with
the document so it does not

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.990
interrupt the flow
of the user.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:32.330
So this is a natural place where
your app shows and is

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.900
very useful.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.880
And again, using
DocumentApp.getUi.showSidebar.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.510
You can also surface your
app in a dialog.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.420
That interrupts the flow of the
user, but it's perfect for

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.920
forms and other things.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.340
Again, using
DocumentApp.getUi.showDialog.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.620
It's quite similar to what
you saw yesterday

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.170
in the Forms session.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.910
This was pretty similar where
it was FormsApp.getUi and

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.720
showDialog and all of that.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.630
So there's a consistent theme
around it as to how you get to

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.780
the UI of Docs.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.770
This example here is a little
bit involved, but it shows you

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.980
how you can serve your
app in a dialog.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.790
So say for instance, if you had
a configdialog.html or an

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.040
HTML file in your script project
and that's the app

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.100
that you wanted to show in a
dialog, then you can very

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.470
easily, using HTML service of
Apps Script, create an HTML

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.850
output object and just
plug that in, in Show

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.570
Dialog, and that's it.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:45.700
So you create an HTML output
object using HTML service, and

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.110
just paste that in Show
Dialog, and your

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.360
app as up and about.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.990
So we talked about four steps,
and we talked just two steps.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.180
You can create scripts using
the Script Editor.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.260
You can extend the UI of Google
Docs, plug into the UI.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.450
The third thing you want to do
is you want to wire your app

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.100
into the Google Docs UI.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.370
So the idea is your app should
fire up somehow.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.800
Or another way of asking this
is, what is the Main

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.090
equivalent, Main function,
as you have in Java or C?

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.610
What is the Main here?

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.790
So let's look at how your
app gets loaded up.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.760
So when a user opens a document,
Apps Script looks in

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.080
your code and looks for a
function called onOpen.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.020
So onOpen is sort of that
equivalent of Main.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.660
And once Apps Script finds
onOpen, it executes onOpen.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.260
So a typical use of onOpen
is to insert menus.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.160
Because you want to be able to
extend the UI once the user

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.360
opens the document.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.960
And then, by clicking on menu
items, you want the user to

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.190
start using the app.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.070
So this is a natural flow.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.640
A document is opened, onOpen is
called, onOpen inserts menu

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.660
items, and then user can click
on menu item and the

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.210
corresponding function
will be invoked.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.405
So that's simple,
straightforward.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.580
So we covered three steps--

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.510
create scripts using the Script
Editor, extending the

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.000
UI of Google Docs, responding
to events.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.620
Jonathan now is going to cover
how you can work with the

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.400
document and modify
the documents.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.140
Jonathan?

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:28.410
JONATHAN RASCHER: Yes.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.870
Thank you, Saurabh.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.270
So Saurabh began the talk
with our friend Bob.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.140
And he was a Google Docs user,
like Saurabh and I, like, I

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.460
think, almost all of
you, it seems like.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.140
And he had this problem
with Google Docs.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.110
He wanted an ability to manage
bibliographies in Docs.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.440
And so we built him an app for
that called Bibstro using this

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.160
new Apps Script
[? configuration. ?]

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.770
And so Saurabh just covered
the first three

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.530
steps we used for this.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.090
So we created some scripts.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.630
We extended the Google Docs UI
with custom UI elements.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.330
And we can respond to events
from those UI elements for

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.320
things like menu clicks or
button clicks, for example.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.900
So that brings us to
the fourth point.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.040
And this point is completely
specific to DocumentApp.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.420
If any of you saw, for example,
the talk some of our

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.200
colleagues gave yesterday about
the integration with

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.210
Google Apps Script and Google
Forms, you'll see that these

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.630
first three steps are very
similar in Forms as in Docs or

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.980
in Spreadsheets.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.110
But this fourth step is specific
to Google Docs.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.215
So what we need to learn is, how
is the document exposed to

00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:29.830
Apps Script?

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.630
So when we want to do something
in Bibstro, like

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.060
maintain this live updating
bibliography at the end of the

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.160
document, how do we actually
insert, and read, write, and

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.950
modify the text in
the document?

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.840
And there's a couple of
different ways that we can

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.800
work with the Google Docs
document from Apps Script,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.650
which I'm calling
document models.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.370
The first of those is as
a tree of elements.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.590
So if you've ever done work
with, say, HTML or XML, the

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.780
Document Object Model or the
DOM, then this should be

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.400
somewhat familiar to you.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.180
It's a tree-structured
document,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.990
much like a web page.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.900
Let's take a look at what
this looks like.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.100
So on the left, you can see
we have a document.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.270
This one's pretty simple.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.950
It's got a couple
of paragraphs.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.430
There's a bulleted list.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.530
There's a table and then at
the bottom of the page,

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.060
there's a page footer.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.490
So this is all exposed to Apps
Script as Document, the

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.990
Document class.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.910
And we get this in Apps
Script code by saying

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.530
DocumentApp.getActiveDocument.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.980
And we'll see some
code samples for

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.500
this in just a minute.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.630
So this is sort of the
equivalent of the root element

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.320
of, say, a web page,
the HTML element.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.800
And like the HTML element in a
web page, it's subdivided up

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.920
into sections.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.130
So we can see we have a body
section at the top that's

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.150
highlighted.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.210
And then there's
a little break.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.670
And then down at the bottom,
we have a footer section.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:46.640
A page could also have, for
example, a header section.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.090
Or it could have a
footnote section

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.470
for numbered footnotes.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:50.820
And these are all optional.

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.890
But any page is going to have
a body, a document body.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.750
If we take a look now inside the
body, you can see that it

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.950
contains elements--

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.390
again, like in a web page-- it
contains elements for things

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.110
like paragraphs, list items,
tables, and so forth.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.240
These are kind of
the equivalent

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.190
of block level elements.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.440
And they, in turn, are further
subdivided up into other

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.780
elements, into inline
elements.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.980
For example, if we take a look
at this first paragraph here,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.640
this first paragraph just
has some text in it.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.710
But in the middle of that
run of text, the text is

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.730
interrupted by an image.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.830
So how is this exposed
to Apps Script?

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.810
If you take a look now, you can
see that this paragraph

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:33.110
element has three
child elements.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.740
There's a text element, and
that represents the run of

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.700
text up to but not including
the image.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.770
And then in the middle,
there's an

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.200
inline image element.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.770
And that lets Apps Script access
properties of the image

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.280
like the binary contents of the
image or the MIME types,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.450
so whether it's a PNG,
or a JPEG, or a GIF,

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.970
or what have you.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.980
And then after that, there's
another text element.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.430
And this next text element just
contains all of the text

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.390
in the paragraph from the inline
image up until the end

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.790
of the paragraph.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.890
And again, if you've ever done
work with HTML, it should be

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.320
very similar to what you've
done with web pages.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.220
Some of the element names are
little bit different, but the

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.030
basic idea is the same.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.010
And in Apps Script, when we work
with the document that

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.820
the user sees on screen, what
we're actually doing when we

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.730
use this tree-based document
model is saying, OK, we're

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.400
going to take a look at
the document tree.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.180
And we're going to take a look
just at specific elements or

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.390
specific nodes in the document
tree and do things like insert

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.690
elements or delete them,
change style

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.860
properties, and so forth.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.480
This has all been kind of
an abstract overview.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.440
So now let's see a
concrete example.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.380
So recall from Bibstro, we had
this functionality where

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.156
Bibstro maintained, again,
the bibliography at

00:16:41.156 --> 00:16:42.560
the end of the document.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.070
And you saw that the first thing
Saurabh did in his demo,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.170
he configured Bibstro to
pick a citation format.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.830
So he picked MLA format.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.400
But let's say you have a paper,
and you want to change

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.860
it for another journal.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:55.250
For example, you want
to change it to a

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:56.780
new citation format.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.910
So you go into Configure.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.660
You change from MLA format to
APA format, for example.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.970
So what we want Bibstro
to do--

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.410
and what it, in fact, does--

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.400
is at that point updates the
bibliography, replaces the

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.130
existing sources, the existing
formatted references, with new

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.740
references in the new citation
format that you selected.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:15.839
So now, let's take
a look at how we

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.089
actually do that in Bibstro.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:21.680
Step one is we define the
bibliography in the document.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.510
We need to find the elements
in this document tree that

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.099
represent the contents of the
bibliography that the user

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.270
sees in their Document View.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:31.380
And you can see at the top,
I've put this little blue

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:38.420
rectangle around this element
that says "Works Cited."

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.660
That's what we're going to call
the Title Paragraph at

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.390
the top of the bibliography.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.470
And it's part of the MLA
citation format.

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.650
It's an indicator to somebody
reading an article or an essay

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.950
or what have you that OK,
the paper is done now.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.160
This is where the bibliography
starts.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.330
But it can also be an indicator
to Apps Script

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.150
programmatically of that
exact same thing.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.810
That this is where, in the
document tree, the

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.060
bibliography begins.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.350
So step one--

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.120
there's going to be three
steps total--

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.480
step one here is to find
that paragraph.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.180
So here we have some code
to do just that.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.060
So we start out with
documentApp.getActiveDocument,

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.930
and we say getBody to get that
body section-- the main

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.310
contents of the document
between

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.350
any headers or footers.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.510
And then we just do this while
loop, and we'd use the

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.250
findElement call on
the document body.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.310
So what the findElement call
does is it takes two

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.120
parameters.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.490
It takes the type of element
we want to find.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.610
In this case, we say that's
just a paragraph.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.180
So what we're saying actually
here is, loop over all the

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.550
paragraphs in the
document body.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.910
And then it also takes this
search result object.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.820
And at each iteration of the
loop, the search result object

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.000
is going to be populated with
the elements that we're

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.820
looking at right now.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.890
And so we take that element,
that paragraph that we're

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.420
looking at, and we get its
text using Edit as Text.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.320
And we compare that to
this known string,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.060
which is Works Cited.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.860
And when we find this paragraph
whose text is equal

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.000
to Works Cited, we know that
we've completed step one here.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.590
We found the title paragraph,
and hence, we found the rest

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.590
of the bibliography in the
document, which brings us to

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.060
this point.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.590
And so because the user wanted
to change their citation

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.770
format, the easiest way to do
this is just completely wipe

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.230
out the contents of the
bibliography and then just

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.590
reinsert new bibliography entry
paragraphs using the new

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.650
citation format.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.990
So let's take a look
at how we do this.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.840
We start out with the title
paragraph that we had

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.980
previously.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.770
And now we do another
while loop.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.850
But this time, we're not
finding elements.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.080
We're looking at the next
sibling elements.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.450
Again, if you worked with the
document tree in HTML--

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:39.110
with JQuery, for example--

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.100
this should be somewhat
familiar.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.140
And if not, basically, a sibling
element is just the

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.460
element in the document that
comes immediately after the

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.420
bibliography title.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.970
So we do this, and now we want
to remove that paragraph, that

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.550
first bibliography entry after
the title from the document.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.690
So how do we do this?

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.270
It's a two step process.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.220
So we take the title paragraph,
we get the

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.500
paragraph after it.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.840
And we take this bibliography
entry

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.840
paragraph and we call Clear.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.960
What Clear does is it says,
take the contents of this

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.110
paragraph, any text or any other
elements inside of it,

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.210
and just wipe them out
of the document.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.640
So at this point, we have the
title paragraph followed by an

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.410
empty paragraph where the
first bibliography

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.280
entry used to be.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.840
But we don't even want
an empty paragraph.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.340
We don't want to have any
paragraph at all left.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.450
So what we do is
we call Merge.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:26.680
Merge is kind of an interesting

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.150
operation, I think.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.380
It doesn't really map up cleanly
to the HTML document

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.730
object model or to an XML
document operation.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.920
What Merge is going to do is
it's going to say, take this

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.920
second paragraph, this
bibliography entry paragraph--

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.790
now it's empty because
we just cleared it--

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.680
and collapse this empty
paragraph into the

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.060
paragraph before it.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.642
So now, after we call Merge, the
end result is we used to

00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:51.320
have two paragraphs, now
we just have one.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.790
And its contents is just the
contents of the title

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:57.330
paragraph, because we cleared
the contents of the old

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.530
bibliography entry before
we called Merge.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.890
And so then we just
do this in a loop.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.320
And each iteration of the loop
uses this two step process to

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.430
remove one of the biography
entries from the document.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.740
And we do this until we've
removed all of those

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:15.005
bibliography entries after the
title paragraph, which brings

00:21:15.005 --> 00:21:16.150
us to this point.

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.370
So at this point, we have
the Works Cited

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.040
paragraph at the top.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.520
And it's sitting there all by
its lonesome self, and it's

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.120
kind of sad, because all of
its friends are gone.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.060
So now what we want to do is
insert some new paragraphs

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.920
after it with the same
bibliography data from the

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.270
data store, but with the
new citation formats.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.860
The text in the document will
be different even though it

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.530
represents the same sources.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.060
And we do this as follows.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.280
This time, instead of removing
elements from the document, we

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.550
want to insert elements into
the document tree.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.190
So we take the title
paragraph--

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.680
once again, this is kind of our
anchor or our reference

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.110
point that tells us where in
the document tree does the

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.285
structured bibliography start?

00:21:55.285 --> 00:21:57.460
And we take that title paragraph
and we get its

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.920
parent element.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.390
So in this case, that'll
most likely be the

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.860
document's body element.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.780
But it makes the code a little
bit more general to speak of

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.880
it just as a parent.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.660
And so we take this parent
element, and we use it to get

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.510
the child index of the
title paragraph.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.705
That is to say, we use it to get
a number that represents

00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:17.900
OK, which element, how many
elements into the parent is

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.660
this title paragraph?

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.980
And then we load some source
data for the bibliography

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.660
references.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.400
We load that from
a data store.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.710
And for each source, we have
some code somewhere to format

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.060
that according to the
citation format that

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.200
the user has selected.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:31.820
And so we do that.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.100
And we have this
formatted text.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.800
And now we need to actually
put it into the document.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.970
And this is really simple.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.270
We take the parent element that
we found a minute ago,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.270
and we just say, Insert
Paragraph.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.850
That takes two things.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.200
First of all, it takes a child
index or an insertion point.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.610
And to get this, we just use
the insertion point that we

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.390
computed previously, by getting
the child index of the

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.600
title paragraph and adding
one to that.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.440
And then this also takes a
string, which, in this case,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.780
is just the formatted contents
of this new paragraph of the

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.290
bibliography entry.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.430
So we make this Insert
Paragraph call.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.990
And after we do that, we've
now inserted a new

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.270
bibliography entry paragraph
after the title paragraph.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.880
And then we can do things like
set margins, set styles, or

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.610
whatever we want to do
on this new paragraph

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.500
that we've just inserted.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.410
And that's about it.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.580
We do this in a loop, over and
over again for each source.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.640
And at the end of this loop and
at the end of this three

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.000
step process, we've now removed
the old bibliography

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.990
entries from the document and
replaced them with new entries

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.500
using the new, up-to-date
citation format.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.910
And so that's pretty much how
we use the document tree in

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.610
Apps Script to work
with the document.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:37.445
And it's great.

00:23:37.445 --> 00:23:39.240
It's a little bit involved,
but it's really not that

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.870
complicated.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.650
But it does involve a
good bit of code.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.240
You can see I had to split
this over three slides.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.680
So for cases where we don't
actually care about the

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.360
elements of the document, about
the tree structure, it

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.550
seems like it would be nice if
we had some way to work with

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.240
the document just as rich text,
ignoring intricacies

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.390
like different elements.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.220
It turns out that we also can
look at the document as this.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.310
The second document model is a
long string of formatted text,

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.800
of rich text, ignoring anything
like non-text

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.870
elements, like sections
and so forth.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.800
And you recall from Bibstro,
we had this functionality

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.230
where we have this sidebar,
which I totally love.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.210
We have this sidebar, and the
user can pick a source in the

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.355
bibliography in the sidebar.

00:24:23.355 --> 00:24:25.570
And they can click the
Highlight button.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.990
And then that source, all the
citations that reference that

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.620
source, will be highlighted in
the document by setting their

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.580
background to yellow.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.720
So how do we do this?

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.590
Do we need to worry about
element trees and all of this

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.655
for something like this
that's strictly

00:24:37.655 --> 00:24:39.130
a text-based approach?

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.110
I saw somebody shake their head,
and I love that, because

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.600
no, we don't.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.310
So we have
DocumentApp.getActiveDocument

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.380
and getBody, and that's
the same as before.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:50.350
But now the technique we're
using here starts

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.620
to diverge a bit.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.590
So now we say Edit as Text.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.590
You might recall we did this
a minute ago on a single

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.010
paragraph to get just the
text of a paragraph.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.820
But we can also do this on the
entire document body, and this

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.480
is going to give us back a text
element that contains

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.240
just the textual contents of the
paragraph with things like

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.390
inline images or inline drawings
just left out.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.940
So they're still left
in the document.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.440
They won't be removed from the
document that the user sees.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.940
But they're removed from the
model of the document, or the

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.780
view of the document, that's
exposed to Apps Script.

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.780
And then we can use normal
string operations in

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:22.850
JavaScript.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.710
For example, here we have a
regular expression in the

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.350
middle of the slide.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.760
And that matches parenthesized
substrings in the

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.920
document, or citations.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.820
And you can tell it's a regular
expression because it

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.450
is horrendously ugly
and it's just an

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.980
abomination to look at.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.220
But that's just standard
JavaScript.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.960
And so we do a JavaScript
regular

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.770
expression match in a loop.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.890
And we loop over all the
citations in the string

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:45.790
contents of the document body.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.160
And for each of those citations,
what we do is we

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.090
say, OK, we have some
logic to find out.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.180
Does it go with the source that

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.410
we're trying to highlight?

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:55.470
And if it does, we want to set
the background color for that

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.000
substring in the document
body to yellow.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.130
So we use this body text element
that we got in the

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.780
first step, and we say
body text element

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.360
set background color.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.040
And that takes just
three things.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.920
It takes the first two
parameters as indices, so a

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.270
start index and an end index.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.330
And we compute these just
using the normal regular

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.860
expression indices we got from
the RegEx match, because these

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.620
indices, they're just character
text indices.

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.540
They ignore things like
element child

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.640
positions and so forth.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.810
And then finally, we just
pass in a color.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:28.630
So that's the hexidecimal
color code for yellow.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.910
And that's about it.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.380
So this Edit as Text based
approach, you can see it's

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.960
very different than
the document tree.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.730
It is not quite as powerful.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.450
The document tree can do
anything to the document,

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.830
whereas this can only perform
text and formatting

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.880
operations.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.510
But for text and formatting
operations like highlighting

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.870
citations in an essay, in fact,
this lets you do the

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.380
same thing as you can do with
the tree-based approach, but

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.660
in much less code.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.670
And, in my opinion, in code
that's much easier to read,

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.710
regular expressions
notwithstanding.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.440
So that's about it.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.290
We have these two models
of the document.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.650
We can work with it either as a
tree, like a web page, or as

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.520
a long string of rich text with
formatting attributes

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.470
applied to each character
in that string.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.810
There's one other model of
working with the document.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.100
This is not launched yet, but
it's going to be coming out in

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.760
the next couple of weeks after
I/O. And you saw Saurabh

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.330
actually hinted at
it in his demo.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.600
And that is, we're going to give
you an API to work with

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.000
cursor and selection
in the document.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.240
So when the user positions their
cursor in some text or

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.500
next to an image, or selects a
range of text or a table or

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.930
whatever you might have, we're
going to give you the ability

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.650
to determine where is the
cursor, or what is the

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.260
selection, and to operate on
the cursor or selection by

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.400
doing things like inserting
text at the cursor.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.350
So recall from the Bibstro demo
that Saurabh showed, we

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.090
have this menu, and we let the
user put their cursor after a

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.070
sentence or phrase they
want to cite.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.470
And the user says,
Insert Citation.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.270
And we show them a dialog,
and they pick a source.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.710
And then that source appears
in the document right after

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.060
their cursor.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.570
So this is working today.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.410
We're finalizing the API for
launch to give you something

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.970
that reduces complexity in
a bunch of edge cases.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.350
There are surprisingly
many edge

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.700
cases in document selection.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.340
It's kind of amazing.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:12.880
So there you go.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.740
That's about it.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.480
We have these four steps that
we use to build this app

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.255
called Bibstro, to build
a bibliography

00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:20.000
app in Google Docs.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.640
So we created some scripts using
the Script Editor, using

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.290
the new Google Docs integration
that we just

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.120
launched a couple days ago.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.990
And we extended the Google Docs
UI to add things like

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.990
custom menus and dialogs, and
my personal favorite, custom

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.540
sidebars, because who doesn't
love a sidebar?

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.920
And then we also have the
ability to respond to events,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.730
just like in any other

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.890
event-driven programming framework.

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.880
And those events can do things,
they can do operations

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.150
on the document on behalf of the
user, which is what makes

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.140
this all work together and
lets us build apps that

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.750
automate Google Docs--

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.500
apps like Bibstro or apps like
whatever you all want to do

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.940
any use case, document workflow,
whatever you want in

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.070
Google Docs.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.340
I'm excited to see what
you all are going

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.460
to build with this.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:02.320
I kind of hope you give it a
better name than Bibstro,

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.510
because that's just bad.

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:06.430
So we have this.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:07.680
That's about it for the talk.

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.850
We have some links here
to our documentation.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.240
And also, I know I brushed over
the code samples kind of

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.380
quickly to get in a couple
of examples.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.670
So we're going to be posting
all of the code for this

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.530
Bibstro sample app online in a
couple of weeks after I/O. So

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.910
keep your eye on, say, the
Google Apps Developer Blog and

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.920
the Apps Script pages on
developers.google.com.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.190
So I think that's about it.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.530
Thank you all for watching.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.150
And, at this point, if you have
any questions, looks like

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.920
there's a couple of mics in
the middle of the room.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.960
So come up and talk
into the mic.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.798
Thank you.

00:29:36.798 --> 00:29:46.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.320
AUDIENCE: Hi Is this available
only for Docs, or available

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.520
also for the Spreadsheets
and the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.220
SAURABH GUPTA: Today, you
can use scripts in

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.580
Spreadsheets and cite.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.070
In yesterday's session, we
announced in Forms as well and

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.460
now in Documents.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:06.020
Yes, please.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.690
AUDIENCE: The adding of the
menus is different on

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:08.630
Spreadsheets, right?

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.110
So in Spreadsheets,
you say, Add Menu.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.830
And so when are you going
to integrate the same

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:20.580
functionality, the new UI
service to add the sidebars?

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.730
What's the timeline for that
coming on Spreadsheets?

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.910
SAURABH GUPTA: It will
happen pretty soon,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:27.730
and this will converge.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:33.370
As you saw in Forms and Docs,
we are creating a concept of

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.845
DocumentApp.getUi.

00:30:34.845 --> 00:30:37.080
So if you can get handle to the
UI, you'll see something

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.660
similar in Spreadsheets
as well.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.920
JONATHAN RASCHER: Right, and
this will include the full

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.630
range of what we talked
about today.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:44.070
So things like, for example,
the sidebar that you can't

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.780
show today in Spreadsheets.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.950
That sidebar that exists now in
DocumentApp and in FormApp

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:50.360
will be coming to SpreadsheetApp
in the next

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.630
couple of weeks.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:57.180
AUDIENCE: Just on the new
cursor-based location, would

00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:01.520
we get a right click menu?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.250
SAURABH GUPTA: We have not
planned for it, but let's talk

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.980
about it at the Office Hours.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.080
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.170
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes, please?

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.140
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
about deployment.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.790
So is it something I can create
only inside my own

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.910
document, or is it something I
can create once and deploy it

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.812
to all the users in my domain?

00:31:17.812 --> 00:31:19.680
SAURABH GUPTA: So what you're
asking is really how you

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.380
distribute a script that can
be inserted into all the

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.210
documents across a number
of users and stuff.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.700
So we're working on that.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.090
And do watch the Google Apps
Developers Blog for

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.180
more news on that.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.992
It's not there yet,
but coming soon.

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:36.710
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.020
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes, please.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.530
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask about
if you've considered

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.020
cross-document integration.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.000
So for example, if I have a
spreadsheet I want to use as a

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.720
data source to fill a Doc with
the citations, for example, or

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:53.030
if I want to hit an external
data source, such as I've got

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.160
a Cloud SQL database running and
I want to be able to pull

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.800
content from that into a report,
for example, and then

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.680
drive that into a Doc.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.570
JONATHAN RASCHER: So that is
an excellent question.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:04.510
And I think the answer is, we
don't have anything pre-built

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.360
to do this, but I think we give
you all the tools you'd

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.640
need to do that.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.030
For example, we have
services called

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.190
SpreadsheetApp and DriveApp.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:13.490
So what you could do--

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.280
I can't think of any
reason not to--

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.720
is you could have a sidebar in
Google Docs, or a dialog, that

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.910
uses the DriveApp service to let
the user pick a file from

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:24.630
their Google Drive, to pick a
spreadsheet, and then use the

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.250
SpreadsheetApp to take that
spreadsheet, read it in data

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.080
format, and populate it
into the document.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.070
So there's nothing prefabricated
to do this, but

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.833
I believe we have all
the tools for

00:32:34.833 --> 00:32:36.083
you to do that today.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:40.550
SAURABH GUPTA: Yes, please?

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.180
One more question.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:44.610
AUDIENCE: Are you planning
on extending the document

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.550
permissions to, for example,
keep allowance for editing

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:53.630
document but not editing the
scripts inside of documents?

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:54.040
SAURABH GUPTA: I'm sorry.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.520
I did not understand
your question.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.070
AUDIENCE: So when you give
somebody a permission

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.080
currently to edit your document,
you automatically

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.160
give them the permission to edit
scripts in the document.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.550
Are you planning on having a
separate permission to allow

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.500
editing the document, but not
allowing editing the scripts?

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.870
SAURABH GUPTA: That's an
interesting question, and we

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.390
debated this a lot.

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.940
When you create scripts,
they're

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.870
a part of the document.

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.340
They are inherent in the
sharing model from the

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.130
document itself.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.890
So Edit privileges on the
document mean Edit privileges

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:27.770
on the script.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.310
However, as a developer, what
you can do is you can use

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:36.010
libraries and then sort of
abstract that out where you're

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:39.030
using a library and not giving
editor permissions on the

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.080
library, just a view.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.370
And so you can abstract
some of that out.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.280
But really, what might help
you is things that we are

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.990
working on, which is the
distribution model, which is

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:52.720
how do you take a script and
just let users install it in

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.900
their documents and stuff.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.180
JONATHAN RASCHER: Yeah,
do you want to--

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.260
AUDIENCE: Can I control the
existing menu of a Google Doc,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.900
like download or print?

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.460
If I want to remove
that or disable

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.930
that, is that possible?

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.040
SAURABH GUPTA: Not today.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.300
You can insert a new
top level menu.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.639
You cannot tinker around with
the existing native menu

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.705
options just yet.

00:34:13.705 --> 00:34:14.120
JONATHAN RASCHER: Right.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.719
And we've thought about things
like this, but there's some

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:17.830
intricacies involved.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.739
For example, Google Docs can
change their menu structure as

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.540
they add features or just as
they move menu items around.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.100
And you wouldn't want your
script to break, for example,

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.429
if a Google Docs menu item
wasn't in the location you

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:29.679
expected it to be at.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.389
is for disabling downloads.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.010
Sometimes you want to share a
folder, and you want people to

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.350
only read documents.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.120
And except for PDFs, where
really you can disable

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.780
downloads, you can't do that
on most document types.

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.400
SAURABH GUPTA: So if I rephrase
your question, you

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.690
want more control over whether
a document can be

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.480
downloaded or not?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.915
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:55.915 --> 00:34:57.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:57.380 --> 00:34:58.030
SAURABH GUPTA: I'm sorry?

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:02.190
SAURABH GUPTA: You cannot
play around with the

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.810
existing menu options.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.530
What you can do is if you want
to build an interesting app,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:11.572
you can add new menu options,
and let users use all of that.

00:35:11.572 --> 00:35:13.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:13.496 --> 00:35:16.184
SAURABH GUPTA: Can you please
come up to the mic?

00:35:16.184 --> 00:35:18.670
AUDIENCE: Is this in your
roadmap, controlling the

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.560
existing menu items, because we
do a lot of requests from

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.200
customers, I can share a
document with someone, but I

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.010
don't want them to print
them or download them--

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.890
just view it.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:29.210
SAURABH GUPTA: Yeah.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.070
I mean, you can share
documents with View

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.620
privileges, and that's a limited
set of things that you

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.080
can do on a document,
and that's about it.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.480
Let's just check online if
there are more questions.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.630
Any questions?

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.220
No questions.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.800
Thank you.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.850
JONATHAN RASCHER: Thank
you very much.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:52.722
[APPLAUSE]
