00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.941
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:02.070
Yeah, let's get started.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.760
To open the summit, we're
going to welcome onto the stage

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.960
the vice president for
engineering for Chrome.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.890
It's a warm welcome to
Linus Upson, everyone.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.945
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:14.778
LINUS UPSON: Thanks.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.000
Wow, a lot of people here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.090
So not surprisingly, I'm
here to talk about the web

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.385
and what we're doing
about it in Chrome.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:28.580
Let's figure out
which button to push.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.650
That looks good.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.310
How many people
here recognize this?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.520
Oh wow, there's a lot
of old people here.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.620
So those of us old
folks will remember,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.370
in the very early
days of the web,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.640
there was this thing called
the NCSA What's New page.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.610
NCSA was where Mosaic was
developed, the first really

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.290
popular web browser.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.650
And back in those days, the
way you found things on the web

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.110
is you went here.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.096
And it had a list of all
the sites on the web.

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:57.720
And so when you stood
up a new website,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.970
you sent an email saying,
hey, I've got a new website.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.360
Could you please link to
me on the What's New page?

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.011
And they would go do that and
have a link to your website

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:05.510
there.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.210
And you can see here
in June 27, 1993,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.300
we had one, two,
three, four, five

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.870
websites that launched that day.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.829
Nothing on the 26th.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:15.870
It was probably a Sunday.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.995
Needless to say,
this didn't scale.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.080
So then the next popular way for
finding things was directories.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.670
Yahoo!

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.900
was the most successful of them.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.384
And many conferences
were held about how

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:34.550
the web should be organized.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.320
People talked about ontologies,
and they came up with ways

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.830
to categorize
everything on the web.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.970
And when you wanted
to find something,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.136
you'd go to Yahoo! or one
of these other directories

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.230
and click on Games
or Entertainment.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.290
And eventually you'd
find a group of websites

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.300
that you could look down and
pick which one you wanted,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.320
or try a few of them
to see if that's

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840
what you were looking for.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.480
And Yahoo!, at the peak of
popularity, had about 3/4

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.050
of a million sites
in their directory.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.790
And I think they peaked at about
a million and a half sites.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.350
So needless to
say, this approach

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.539
didn't scale for
the web, either.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.653
Then came search
engines, Google being one

00:02:12.653 --> 00:02:15.010
of the more successful ones.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.880
The really clever thing
that Larry and Sergey

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.850
did at the very
beginning of Google

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.840
was they figured out that
just the text on the web pages

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.460
told you a lot about the web.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.550
But the links
between those pages

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.012
were also really important.

00:02:31.012 --> 00:02:32.970
And in fact, this chaotic
structure of the web,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.410
with everyone linking
to everyone else,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.440
actually told you a lot
about what was important

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.148
and what wasn't so
that you could deliver

00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:41.440
really great search
results for people.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.110
And so far, this is still
scaled with the web.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.290
And when you think about
it, it's pretty amazing.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.750
Because there are billions
and billions of web pages

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.050
out there.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.430
Hundreds of millions
coming and going every day.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.280
Billions of users.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.820
And for many of us,
on any given day,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.200
we'll consume tens,
if not hundreds,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.240
of different sources of
information, content, services,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.260
applications, communicate
with people, all just

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.930
by doing a search and
clicking on a link.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.220
And so we've been thinking
a lot on the Chrome team

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.570
about what has made
the web successful.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.970
And what are the areas that
it really needs to improve?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.770
And so first, let's
talk about what's

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.700
made the web really successful.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.280
And this first thing
is the HT of HTML.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.750
Everything is a link.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.760
So you can get to anywhere on
the web by typing in a URL,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.090
clicking on a link.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.771
These links can be spoken to
people, just try domain name.

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.270
They can be written
down on napkins.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.530
They can be emailed, IMed, and
so they spread very freely.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.830
And it makes it really
easy to try something

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.320
because all I have to do is
click on a link to do it.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.042
The other important part of
that is it's also ephemeral.

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.000
In other words, there
should be no side effects

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.420
to clicking on links.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.960
I don't have to
install software.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.180
I don't have to update software.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.740
I can just run any piece
of software-- untrusted,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.660
third party code-- by
clicking on a link.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.310
And then when I go
away, my browser

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.400
may end up caching it
for a period of time,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.620
or something like
that, but I, as a user,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.649
don't have to worry about that.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.840
The next thing is indexable.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.220
So web pages show you all
of their text by default.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220
You don't necessarily
have to write it that way,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.290
but the easiest way to write
a web page makes it indexable.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.357
And so this allows
search engines to appear.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.190
And even though search
engines didn't really

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.180
exist at the very
beginning of the web,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.190
the fact that the
web had this property

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.410
allowed it to scale
to this massive size

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.890
with all of these
different pages,

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.486
and yet you can
still find things.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:46.860
And you don't have
to go manually

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.340
organize them into directories
and things like that.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.094
The next thing--
composability-- was not

00:04:54.094 --> 00:04:55.260
at the beginning of the web.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.190
But not long after that,
iframes were invented.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.580
And it made it possible
to take multiple sites

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.560
and mash them up
into one web page.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.020
And so this allowed you to
do things like embed YouTube

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.270
videos in a page, or
put a map in a page,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.040
or, very importantly
for many publications,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.250
to be able to put
an ad in a page.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.840
And the composability also had
some very important properties

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.870
that the page containing
the other page

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.080
couldn't muck with what's inside
it, and the thing inside of it

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.660
couldn't muck with the
outer containing page.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.680
And so this allowed
it to very safely

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.736
be able to aggregate content
from lots of different places

00:05:31.736 --> 00:05:33.610
and make much richer
applications than if you

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.920
had to go get code and
import it from someplace else

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.680
onto your website.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.140
And that also brings me to
the last point, which is safe.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.940
If you're going to run arbitrary
code by clicking on links,

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.310
it had better be safe.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.920
And so one of our most important
jobs as browser vendors

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.340
is to make it so that it's
safe to click on links.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.680
It should be impossible for a
bad guy to lure you to a site

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.040
and then install malicious
software on your computer,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.740
or steal your credentials,
or do anything like that.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.880
And so this set of
properties is what

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.800
we think has really
made the web successful.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.674
Because you saw from
those early screenshots,

00:06:07.674 --> 00:06:09.890
the web was pretty
ugly in the early days.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.040
Everything was gray.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.140
Someday gray will be a
popular background page

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.180
color again, but probably
not any time soon.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.160
But even though the web was
kind of slow, kind of ugly,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.400
the fact that it had these
really nice properties

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.980
caused it to just take off.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.880
And for the better
part of 15 years or so,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.200
most of the innovation that
happened in the technology

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.840
industry happened on
the web because of all

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.425
of these advantages it gave you.

00:06:37.425 --> 00:06:41.820
Then in 2007 came the
iPhone, and shortly

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.430
after that, Android, and a
number of other smartphone

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.930
OSes.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.250
And they completely
changed the game.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.980
And they reset user expectations
in a number of important ways.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.630
One of which is everyone now
expects all user interfaces

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.120
to have rock solid,
60-frames-a-second animations

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.230
and transitions.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.230
This was not something
the web was built to do.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.020
But now everyone expects this
in all of your user interfaces.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.160
Other things it did--
it gave you the ability

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.700
to pre-cache a whole
bunch of software and data

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.914
when you installed an
application so that it worked

00:07:17.914 --> 00:07:19.580
well in flaking
networking environments.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.470
And if any of you remember
the early generation iPhones

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.120
or Android phones, everything
was a very flaky network

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.510
environment.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.040
I can remember when I got
3G, and I was so excited.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.250
I saw the little 3G on there
like, wow, this is fast.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.860
Now with an LTE phone, every
time I see the 3G, I go, aww.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.420
But being able to cache all
of your application code

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.730
and resources upfront
made it work really

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.125
well in these flaky
network environments.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:47.500
Other things it
did-- it gave you

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.770
access to a lot more
IO capabilities.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.666
It gave you direct
access to the GPU.

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:54.165
It gave you access
to touch sensors.

00:07:54.165 --> 00:07:59.060
It gave you access to
raw network access,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.020
device motion, location,
GPS, a whole bunch of things.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.260
It allowed developers to build
more interesting applications

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.560
and ones that were more suited
to the mobile environment.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.740
And it also allowed
you to bring to bear

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.050
a whole bunch of different
development tools.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.390
You weren't stuck
programming in one language

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.480
or one environment.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.810
Even Apple-- I don't know
if you guys remember this,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.840
but a few years ago,
they tried to make it

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.700
so that everyone
building apps for iPhone

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.180
had to write in
Objective-C. They

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.930
tried to ban other languages.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.059
And developers rioted.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.750
And this is Apple.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.929
The Apple development community
more easily follows direction

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.559
and is more homogeneous
than any other development

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.659
community I've seen,
and even they rioted.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.320
The game developer's
like, we need Lua.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.150
And they were like, I need
to write C++ GL games.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.730
And so even Apple had
to back off there.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.580
So the importance for developers
to use whatever languages

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.170
and tool sets and
libraries they want

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.450
to use to build
their applications

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.491
is also really important.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.470
So these are all
the places where

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.120
mobile applications excel.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.180
And these are all
places where we really

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.907
need to close that
gap on the web

00:09:09.907 --> 00:09:11.990
so that you can do all of
these things on the web,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.890
so you retain all the advantages
that web applications have

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.430
that native applications lack.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.120
But one of our goals
on the Chrome team

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.630
is to really close that gap.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.637
So the first thing on the
list is rendering performance.

00:09:25.637 --> 00:09:27.220
So I mentioned before
the expectations

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.180
around mobile devices
now are everything

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.980
is 60 frames a second.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.864
And so when the web
was originally created,

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.530
people really weren't
thinking about how

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.410
to do rendering using GPUs, how
to make it so that you don't

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.220
have stutters and
frame rates, and all

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.220
of these kind of things.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.178
So there's a bunch of
projects we have underway

00:09:47.178 --> 00:09:49.570
in Chrome to do
this, some of which

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.030
involve new web standards
like web animations

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.040
so that you can specify
declaratively what animation

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.770
or transition you
want to have happen.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.910
And then Chrome, or the
browser, can then automatically

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.680
make that happen for you so that
you don't have to write code

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.830
to handle every single
frame of the animation.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.720
And that allows the
system as a whole

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.415
to schedule activity to
maintain that frame rate so

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:13.440
that you don't get glitches.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.070
Other things we're
doing are things

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.740
like reducing garbage
collection pause time.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.594
So if you have to do
work to produce a frame,

00:10:20.594 --> 00:10:22.010
you want to make
sure that you can

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.650
maintain that
constant frame rate.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.890
It really sucks if you're
trying to produce a frame

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.300
and a GC comes, and you go
away for 60 milliseconds,

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.500
and you drop four frames.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.470
And so we're working very hard
to both measure and improve

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.380
garbage collection and other
VM latencies that exist.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.670
Because in complex VMs like
V8, they do clever things like,

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.670
oh, I notice you're running
this function a lot.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.450
Let me optimize it for you.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.110
And even the process
of doing that,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:50.350
that could cause you to
miss an animation frame.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.141
And so we're working
very hard to make sure

00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:53.150
that that never happens.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.000
And there's a bunch of
work under way to do that.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.640
And it's particularly tricky,
both for garbage collection

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.430
as well as [? compilation ?]
pauses and things like that,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.444
because even if you
have multi-core--

00:11:03.444 --> 00:11:04.860
and we work hard
to take advantage

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.693
of all the different
multi-core processors--

00:11:06.693 --> 00:11:08.830
your application might also
be competing for cores.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.480
Or even if you're not
competing for cores,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.938
very often you may be competing
with the garbage collector,

00:11:12.938 --> 00:11:15.390
the compiler, for memory
bandwidth or cache

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.190
pressure, things like that.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.470
So it's a very
challenging problem.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.230
But we've made a lot
of progress on that.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.890
So here's some examples of
the improvements we've made.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.530
So this was one of our
performance dashboards

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.960
that tracks JSGameBench.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.440
And you see some
changes were made

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.990
that dramatically
improve performance.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.490
Now, we also look for
performance regressions.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.670
And we have a lot of
performance dashboards.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.839
If any of you have crawled
around the Chromium site

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:47.130
and tried to look at all of
the performance dashboards,

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.505
I think there are
so many of them

00:11:48.505 --> 00:11:50.780
now that no human can
keep track of them all.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.600
And in fact, about
a year and a half

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.780
ago, we had a massive
regression on one of them.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.210
And nobody noticed.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.410
Because there were just too many
for people to keep track of.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.022
And so that spurred
the team to think

00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:05.480
like, how do we
solve this problem?

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.480
And so since the thing we know
how to do is build software,

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.000
we actually built software to
watch all of the performance

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.480
dashboards for us.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.300
They actually found this
really cool anomaly detection

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.522
framework that was developed
elsewhere in Google

00:12:18.522 --> 00:12:20.730
and trained it to look at
the performance dashboards.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.550
Because as you know,
sometimes it's hard to tell,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:27.740
is it slowly getting slower, or
was there temporary regression?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.110
Was the bot just
having a bad day?

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.610
And so now, we've
got this system

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.737
where I get email
alerts when performance

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:38.070
regresses in any of these areas.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.200
And we have a team of sheriffs
that go and look at the results

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.700
from all of this,
and then go figure

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.350
out what change
caused the regression,

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.690
and go nag the developer who
does that to revert the change

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.650
or make a fix so that we
get the performance back.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.890
And so now, even though we
continue to add capabilities

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.780
to Chrome, and the code
keeps getting bigger,

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.430
it's actually, in
almost every area

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.420
that we can measure,
faster, and uses less memory

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.910
today than the day
we launched five

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:06.637
years ago because of this
continual measurement

00:13:06.637 --> 00:13:07.220
of everything.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.770
Basically for places we regress,
they're usually in areas

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.070
that we failed to measure.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.570
And then when we find them, we
add a new measurement for it,

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.070
and we work hard to
never regress on them.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:20.150
We're not perfect, but we're
getting better and better.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.730
Another area we've improved a
lot is JavaScript performance.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:31.810
We've improved on mobile about
50% in the last year or so.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:37.269
And this is an area that is,
of course, very important to us

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:38.810
because most of the
code that you run

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:40.018
is all written in JavaScript.

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:45.090
And so this goes directly to how
fast your applications can be.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.700
In addition, we
launched a new version

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.230
of the Octane benchmark.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.417
So Octane is the benchmark
we use to tune V8 against.

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:56.000
Because we basically try to put
things in Octane that we think

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.020
are important to make go fast.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.020
And then we work really
hard to make it go fast.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:03.030
And in Octane 2.0,
the changes we

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.727
made there were
primarily around latency.

00:14:06.727 --> 00:14:08.810
For the first time, we
have a JavaScript benchmark

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.860
that actually
measures latency so

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.140
that if you have long GC
pauses or frequent GC pauses

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.340
or things like that, you'll
score poorly on the benchmark.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.740
We also brought in a bunch
of code from Emscripten.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.710
So basically, we have a zlib
compiled down to JavaScript

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.030
with Emscripten.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.200
So we're using asm.js-style
JavaScript and include that

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.490
in the benchmark as well.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.470
And we don't implement a special
compiler or anything like that.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.380
But we're just trying to
make generic V8 work well

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.610
on all kinds of JavaScript, even
machine-generated JavaScript,

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.690
like the stuff that
comes out of Emscripten.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:52.520
And then we also added some
other large programs in there

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.645
to really test parse time,
compilation time, and latency,

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:57.520
and things like that.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.511
So large code
bases of JavaScript

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.510
so that those things get
benchmarked and tested,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.010
as well.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:08.250
So another area-- and we
talked about working well

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.510
in flaky networks and
network performance.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.200
One of the things we've
done to make the web more

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.940
usable on mobile
devices is we've

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.670
introduced this mobile
data compression proxy.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:22.550
And it gives you a 50% savings
on the data transmitted.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.580
Right now, we're really
focused mostly on saving data.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.160
Because a lot of people's
usage of their mobile device

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.810
is limited by
paying for the bits

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.540
that they get over the air.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:37.765
And so we're really focused on
shipping fewer bits to them.

00:15:37.765 --> 00:15:40.390
But also, there's opportunities
to get performance improvements

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.070
here, as well.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.430
In addition to
building proxies--

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.800
and one of the biggest
things that the mobile data

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.300
compression proxy does is it
converts JPEGs to webp images,

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.890
which are about 25% smaller for
the same quality level as JPEG.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.550
But also, by making that image
format available on the web

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.680
generally, a lot
of sites at Google

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.590
have converted to using webp
if the browser supports it.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:14.460
And a number of sites at Google
have seen latency reductions

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.300
on the order of 30%, 40% because
a large portion of that page

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.576
load time is just transferring
data down to the user.

00:16:20.576 --> 00:16:21.950
So if you can
transfer less data,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.030
you can make the
web much faster.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.670
And the same is true on video.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.360
Going from VP8, which is about
comparable to H264 in terms

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.950
of quality per bit,
and moving to VP9,

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.582
we're getting a 50%
savings in the data rate.

00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:38.540
And so there's a number
of properties at Google

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:42.760
that are moving to
use VP9 inside of webm

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.950
to transfer less
data down to users.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.460
And this, of course,
is particularly

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.630
important on mobile devices.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:55.270
So some of you may know-- how
many of you have met app cache?

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.030
How many of you have typed
"app cache" into Google,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.079
but not hit Return to see
what the suggestions are?

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.510
LINUS UPSON: So
ServiceWorker is an attempt

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.500
to repent for those sins.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.329
We want web applications to
be able to work really, really

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.099
well, even in flaky
network connections,

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.119
or even when you're
completely offline.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.619
And so we're putting
a lot of effort

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:24.710
into ServiceWorker to make
that much easier to program

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.150
and much more reliable to
program in that kind of model.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.460
And we're also
doing a lot to add

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.780
APIs to access all of
the different hardware

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.560
capabilities of both
desktops, laptops,

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.160
as well as mobile devices.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.610
We've already got parts of
the device motion API in.

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.490
We already have a location.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.320
And a bunch of additional
things are underway.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.870
Three other big things
have landed recently.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:01.680
We've got WebGL,
WebRTC, and Web Audio.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.910
And so this allows you to do
much more interesting graphics

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.550
on the web than you
could do before.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.515
Allows you to do very
interesting multimedia,

00:18:08.515 --> 00:18:10.390
both video and audio.

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.140
And WebRTC, in
particular, I think

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:15.640
is really going to
revolutionize communications.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.960
Because now, you can really--
when you think about it,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.740
web is really about
communicating with people.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.580
And it's a shame that we've
gone all this time without you

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.510
actually being able to
communicate with people.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.180
And WebRTC is going to enable
this for the first time.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.620
It's very cool.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:39.960
I talked about some of the APIs
that have come in recently.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.760
The other thing that
mobile applications

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.950
have gotten to take advantage
of is new UI toolkits and new UI

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.300
paradigms.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.790
So we're working on
a number of things

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.180
here to make it much easier
to build really beautiful user

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.240
interfaces and to make them
work well in touch environments

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.390
and in different screen sizes.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.970
So one of the things that's
obvious about mobile is typing

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.250
is a lot harder.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.150
And so we've recently
introduced something

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.900
called request autocomplete.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.110
And what this does is
it allows the browser

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.810
to remember sets of information,
the most important of which

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.750
is payment.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.990
Because if you want to
buy something on the web,

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.670
having to type in
credit card number,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.470
shipping address,
mailing address, all

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.770
of those kinds of
things, it's a real pain.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.860
And so this allows
you to do that once,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.660
either on a mobile
device or on a desktop,

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.950
and then Chrome syncs it across
all of the different platforms.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.187
And then when you want to
go check out on a website,

00:19:40.187 --> 00:19:41.770
it can just call
request autocomplete.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.100
It shows you a dialogue with all
of your information filled out,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.740
and say, hey, do you want
to send this to the website?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.698
You can look at it and
say, yeah, that's great,

00:19:47.698 --> 00:19:48.862
and click OK.

00:19:48.862 --> 00:19:50.570
If you need to change
something, you can.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.790
You can select a different
shipping address, for example,

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.350
or select a different
credit card.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.950
But for most cases,
this really just brings

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.259
really, really simple checkout
flows to mobile devices.

00:20:00.259 --> 00:20:01.800
And there's some
other things we have

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.290
in the pipeline along
this line, as well.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.400
Another big thing
we're doing is Polymer.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.450
How many people here
have heard of Polymer?

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:10.530
OK.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.290
It's really exciting
on two levels.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.510
One, and this may seem obvious,
but in most programming

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.730
environments, you
can write a function

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.560
in terms of other functions.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.370
With web components that
Polymer's built on top of,

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.970
for the first time
on the web, you

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:34.010
can actually write HTML tags
in terms of other HTML tags

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:35.934
and bundle the appropriate
CSS and JavaScript

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.100
with it and things, as well.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.810
So you can build real
first class components

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.730
and have structured
programming on the web,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.860
and not just
cut-and-paste programming.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.950
And so this is huge.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:50.440
And Polymer is a toolkit that
was designed from the beginning

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.530
to live on top of
web components.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.130
And it brings both the
structure of the application,

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.730
to make it much easier to build
your app, as well as a user

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.670
interface layer so that you
can have really beautiful 60

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.131
hertz animations
and transitions.

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:07.380
It knows what all of the
fast paths are in the browser

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.610
and tries to stay on them.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.230
In fact, by definition,
there's this constant feedback

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.672
loop going between the Polymer
team and the Blink team

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:16.130
so that every time the Polymer
team needs to make something

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.100
fast, the Blink team
goes and makes that fast.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.920
And so by using this toolkit,
it's one of the easiest ways

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.750
to stay on all of the fast
paths inside of Chrome.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.657
And it's also got
polyfills for all

00:21:25.657 --> 00:21:27.240
of the other modern
browsers, as well.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.190
So you can write your
application once and deploy it

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.731
across all of the
different browsers.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.500
So what else is this one?

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.896
I forgot what's on this slide.

00:21:40.896 --> 00:21:42.300
AUDIENCE: Add to homescreen.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:42.800
LINUS UPSON: This is what?

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.966
AUDIENCE: Add to homescreen.

00:21:43.966 --> 00:21:46.450
LINUS UPSON: Add to
homescreen, right.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.430
So in the latest
version of Chrome,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.610
you can now be browsing
around in Chrome on Android,

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.340
and you can take a
web page and add it

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.700
to the homescreen of Android.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.870
So something really
simple, but it

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.400
makes it a lot easier for
people to go back and get

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.290
to websites again.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:13.090
And of course, we're working on
making handling the source set,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.240
or what's the other one called?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.347
Set In?

00:22:17.347 --> 00:22:18.180
AUDIENCE: Source In.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.084
LINUS UPSON: Source In, yes.

00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:22.500
So that you can handle multiple
image resolutions, as well

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.376
as handling composition and art
direction and things like that,

00:22:26.376 --> 00:22:27.750
which is really
important-- being

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.660
able to work across lots
of different screens.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.297
And also very
importantly, we care

00:22:33.297 --> 00:22:34.755
a lot about developer
productivity.

00:22:34.755 --> 00:22:37.660
So we've invested a lot
in Chrome's dev tools.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.711
How many people
here have used them?

00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:40.210
Everyone.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.584
OK, so you're
familiar with them.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:49.726
So if you can't easily
develop debug applications,

00:22:49.726 --> 00:22:51.350
you're not going to
be very productive.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.180
And so we really want to
make this better and better.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.980
So a lot of things
have shipped recently.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.360
And let me take a look here.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.860
See if I remember all of them.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.540
We have-- let's see,
there's projecting.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.485
There's remote
debugging to mobile.

00:23:12.485 --> 00:23:17.440
And I think there's also--
what was the other one?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.410
Screencasting?

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.850
AUDIENCE: The Layers panel.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.484
LINUS UPSON: The
Layers panel, yes.

00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.400
And in addition to that,
there's a whole bunch

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.020
of tools we've developed for
debugging GPU performance.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.744
Because it's very
hard, sometimes--

00:23:28.744 --> 00:23:30.160
when you're writing
something, you

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.610
see a little screen stutter--
to figure out what happened.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.485
And being able to go
into the developer tools

00:23:34.485 --> 00:23:36.930
and see a timeline, and
watch exactly, like, ah.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.690
This bit of code was
running right here,

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.273
and that's why I
dropped those frames.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.080
We also want to make
it possible for people

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.340
to use whatever languages
or tools they want,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.620
and still be able to
deploy on the web.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.510
So we want to make Emscripten
code run really fast so that

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.190
you take C or C++ code and be
able to deploy that on the web.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:00.240
We want people to be able to
write more structured programs

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.950
than you can in
JavaScript with Dart.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.190
We want that to be able to
run across all browsers.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.530
We just released Dart
1.0 a few days ago.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.090
And with Dart to JS, you
can deploy it everywhere.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.070
There's even a number of
cases where the Dart to JS

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.280
will actually produce faster
code than idiomatic JavaScript.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.140
Because, I mean,
a lot of you here

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.660
are very good
JavaScript developers.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:22.530
But for many
JavaScript developers,

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.310
it's very easy to accidentally
shoot yourself in the foot.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.770
And by having a more structured
language compiled down

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.540
to JavaScript, you can often
get much better performance out

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.650
of it for most programmers.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.870
In addition, we have portable
Native Client inside of Chrome

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.730
so that you can run native code
even faster than Emscripten

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.580
or asm.js-style code.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.490
But you can also take
that code and run it

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.247
in other browsers
with pepper.js.

00:24:48.247 --> 00:24:49.830
So you can take all
of the pepper APIs

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.209
and emulate them
on other browsers.

00:24:53.209 --> 00:24:55.500
And as I said earlier, the
V8 team is working very hard

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.280
to take asm.js-style code
and make it run really,

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.922
really fast in V8.

00:25:00.922 --> 00:25:05.015
Lastly, I talked a lot
about the advantages

00:25:05.015 --> 00:25:07.550
of the web-- of
this linkability,

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:11.680
ephemerality,
composability, being safe,

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.090
and it being indexable.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:15.890
And these are not things
that you typically

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:20.090
get with native
mobile applications.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.220
But we realized that
some people might

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.490
want to be able to ship a native
app but use web technologies.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.110
So we've invested a lot in
contributing to Cordova, which

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.310
is the open source
project behind PhoneGap,

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:33.765
so that you can take what
you've built on the web

00:25:33.765 --> 00:25:36.140
and package it up and deliver
it as a mobile application.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.330
You don't get those core
capabilities and advantages

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.180
you get by being on the
web, but at least it

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.940
allows you to leverage
the same technology

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.330
stack for developing
across different platforms,

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.080
including the web.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.270
So lastly, I would like to
thank you all for coming here.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.760
There's a lot of exciting talks
over the next couple of days.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.260
And so this is a
great opportunity

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.510
to connect not only with all
the other developers here

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.340
in the room, but with a lot
of the Chrome developers

from Google.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:07.275

this conference.

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:11.220
We'll be following along on G+.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.530
