[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.810
PETE LEPAGE: Hey, everybody, and
welcome to another great

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.240
Behind the Divs.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.280
Today, we're going to be talking
with the team behind

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.120
the new Chrome experiment,
Roll It.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.030
So with that, I want to
introduce you guys to two of

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.150
the engineers.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.006
Sean, why don't you go ahead
and introduce yourself?

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:27.200
SEAN KLASSEN: Hey, everybody.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.300
My name is Sean Klassen.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.000
I am one of the founders of a
company called Legwork, and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.380
we're based out of
Denver, Colorado.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.320
And the Google Creative Lab
came to us to help them

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.130
realize this new experiment.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.430
They wanted to show off some
technology with WebSockets and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.190
syncing your mobile device
with your computer.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.060
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.050
And Justin, do you want
to introduce yourself?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.950
JUSTIN GITLIN: Absolutely.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.580
I'm Justin Gitlin, also
in Denver, Colorado.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.940
I'm one of the co-founders and
partners in a development shop

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.280
called Mode Set.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.275
And we've worked with Sean at
Legwork before, and we all

00:04:07.275 --> 00:04:09.270
used to work at a company
together back in the day.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.800
So I've got a great relationship
with them, and,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.920
yeah, so we did most of the
front end development.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.350
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.910
So actually, that's a good
question to start off with.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.780
You guys are sort of two
different agencies.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.260
How did you split the work
between the two of you guys?

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.020
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah, I guess
originally, the Creative Lab

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.890
came to us, and they were
like, hey, we have been

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.720
prototyping with this
new technology.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.490
We want to make a
game with it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.663
What do you guys
have for ideas?

00:04:42.663 --> 00:04:46.310
And we came up with a bunch
of different things.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.200
I remember at one time, we
were talking about making

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.630
almost like a "Guitar Hero"
type of thing, where you'd

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.260
rock out against someone and
eventually settled on where we

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.960
did with this game.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.270
And we brought in Justin--

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.910
like he was saying, we've worked
together on a bunch of

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.150
projects, and he's awesome at
mobile development and just a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.340
great developer in general.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.420
And he helped us make this
thing a reality.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.020
It is really a pretty agile
environment We had some

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.390
initial features and user
stories set up and then just

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.320
kind of kept iterating on the
design and the dev really all

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.400
the way 'til the end
and the launch, and

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.290
we run out of time.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.430
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
often how it works.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.820
It's sort of like really crazy
right up until the end, and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.350
then once you hit the end,
you're like, this is actually

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.110
really good.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.180
We're really impressed
with this.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.480
So--

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.030
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah, and it's
always nerve-racking, too,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.540
because you've been so buried in
it, you don't know how it's

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.030
going to be received.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.370
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.210
And I want to mention to the
folks who are watching live

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.000
right now that if you have
questions that you want to ask

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.440
of either Justin or
Sean, you can post

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.890
those to Google Moderator.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.750
The link is there on screen
somewhere that way I think.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.970
But you can post those there.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.740
We'll be taking those as we go
throughout our Hangout today.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.940
But I want to ask you a little
bit about the workflow because

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.060
working between two agencies and
the Google Creative Labs

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.810
team must've been kind
of interesting.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.320
And I know that at Google I/O
this year, one of the most

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.430
popular sessions from the Chrome
side was about the

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.810
modern mobile workflow.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.390
What did your mobile
workflow look like?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.390
JUSTIN GITLIN: So the workflow
from my end, from the

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:49.010
development side on the front
end, was writing all of the

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.750
code in a Ruby on Rails
environment.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.940
And with that, you get all the
benefits of the Rails asset

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.970
pipeline, which concatenates
all your files, compresses

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.070
them, transcompiles any
CoffeeScript or Sass, Haml,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.830
using Sprockets and whatever
other machineries in the asset

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.230
pipeline to make that really
seamless process.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.450
So I've mentioned that almost
all of the custom code for

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.900
this game was written
in CoffeeScript.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.400
And we found that to be--

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.730
we ended up with less code,
cleaner code than writing pure

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.950
JavaScript.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.070
So that's something that we at
Mode Set generally will write

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.340
99% of the time.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.235
It depends.

00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:41.570
If we're writing something under
500 lines of code, and

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.980
that's the entire project,
or a quick prototype or

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.730
something, we might just write
some raw JavaScript.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.015
But we've really come to love
the things that you gain out

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:52.240
of CoffeeScript.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.690
Especially for this project,
which was quite a bit of code,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.830
many thousands of lines of
custom code on top the

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.700
third-party product libraries
that we used and built in a

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.830
really object-oriented way.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.980
We found that it really helps
you organize and end up with

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.940
much cleaner and less code at
the end of the project.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.400
PETE LEPAGE: Huh.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.840
That's interesting.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.040
One of the questions actually
on our Moderator queue is

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.430
about why you chose
CoffeeScript, which you kind

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.190
of addressed.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.410
But is it something you'd
recommend other folks use?

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.130
JUSTIN GITLIN: Definitely.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.940
So obviously, you have to--

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.990
they call it transcompiling
CoffeeScript to JavaScript.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.090
So there is one step before your
CoffeeScript is ready to

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.020
be interpreted by the browser.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.760
And in our environment, the
Ruby on Rails environment,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.820
it's really easy to set that
up and make it completely

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.280
transparent.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.680
If you don't have a Ruby on
Rails environment or something

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.300
like that that's going to do
it automatically for you as

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.550
you're writing and refreshing
the page and hitting your

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.170
server, I've found that a lot
of people are using a

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.190
front-end compilation
tool called Grunt.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.080
That seems to be a really
popular one, and I've started

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.480
playing with that.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.120
And it's really nice.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.970
So I'd say if you're not using
any sort of server, backing up

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.440
your code, Grunt's a great way
to go to compile and do all of

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.203
the same things pretty
seamlessly as well.

00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:28.370
SEAN KLASSEN: We've used that
on some other projects here

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.820
ourselves when we don't want to
build any kind of back-end

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.030
system or don't have access to
do that for whatever reason.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.870
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.140
JUSTIN GITLIN: Because not every
project is going to have

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.240
a back end.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.470
We've had projects where we just
upload a bunch of files

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.380
to an Apache server,
and that's it.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.740
So I think in that case,
something like

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.980
Grunt's a great option.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.930
In our case, we did end up
compiling the entire site down

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.180
to static files, and we used the
Ruby on Rails helpers to

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.060
do that for us.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:05.700
So we just wrote a little bit
of Ruby to take our dynamic

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.590
assets and translate those into
a static file system.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.940
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.045
So what other tools were you
using for your build process?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.630
SEAN KLASSEN: Like on a higher
level, because Google Creative

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.440
Labs is in New York, we're
both in Denver.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.810
So we needed just some
communication tools that were

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:28.270
pretty important.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:32.260
We used Google Hangouts
almost every day.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:36.750
And then we used Pivotal Tracker
to track all the

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.777
features that we were working
on and prioritize them.

00:10:39.777 --> 00:10:44.760
And that was probably one of
the biggest, most important

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.985
tools for us.

00:10:46.985 --> 00:10:47.320
PETE LEPAGE: Yep.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:53.430
And were you using that for bug
tracking, or what were you

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.670
using that for?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.110
SEAN KLASSEN: We used it for bug
tracking, and then we also

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:02.160
used it just to know what was
next in our to-do list, if

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.840
there's revisions, or how
difficult things we were going

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.210
to be, like if we were going
to hit our milestones.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.940
And we put design items right
along with [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.070
development items.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.560
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.540
All the design tasks were
in there as well.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.240
Cool.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.670
JUSTIN GITLIN: It's a good
way to sort of have some

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.170
conversation going back and
forth about bugs or features,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.870
creating new user stories if
somebody has a brand new

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.890
feature they want to
add into the app.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.000
It's something that we'd track
all that right there and

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.930
prioritize by sort of
ordering the list

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:36.440
of stories in Tracker.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.330
So it's just a nice project
management tool.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.580
PETE LEPAGE: And that's Pivotal
Tracker, you said?

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.290
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yep.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.480
PETE LEPAGE: All right, cool.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.270
So let's take one of the
questions from the folks who

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.440
are watching live.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.470
And Manuel wants to know, how
is it possible to send the

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.630
data from the gyroscope so
fast through the web,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.510
including all the coding and
encoding that makes such a

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.980
game possible?

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.100
JUSTIN GITLIN: So the key
technology there is

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.140
WebSockets.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.110
So if you're not familiar with
WebSockets, it's a lower

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.440
level, faster protocol.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.970
Rather than using HTTP requests,
it creates more of a

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.670
direct connection between your
machine, a server, and then

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.190
another machine--

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.860
or any number of machines.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.420
But in our case, for Roll It, it
was your mobile device and

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.140
your laptop.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.080
And all those messages are
going through a server

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.850
somewhere else, which I think a
lot of people are surprised

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.310
at how quickly you can get those
messages transmitting.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.390
We were sending about 15 to 20
messages a second during

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.270
certain parts of the game,
specifically during gameplay

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.270
for some of the ambient elements
to have a little tilt

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.200
based on the accelerometer data
coming in, as well as on

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.600
the menu screens, the entire
menu sort of tilts back and

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.040
forth, and you get a little ball
rolling across the screen

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.280
to show what your menu
selection is.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.480
And in our case, we're only
sending a really small amount

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.640
of data for that, pretty much
just the tilt angle.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.020
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.040
So that effectively, in the
document, or in the case study

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.280
that you guys wrote, it looks
like that's only maybe 50

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.940
bytes or so to send the tilt.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:17.943
Is that right?

00:13:17.943 --> 00:13:19.940
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yeah, Something
really tiny like that.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.330
It's a really small JSON object
that gets transmitted

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.710
over WebSockets and picked
up on the other device.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.820
So yeah.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.820
I mean, obviously, the smaller
you can keep that data

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.363
transmitting, the quicker
it's going to go.

00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:34.970
And the chance of losing
messages along the way due to

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.820
latency would be decreased.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.100
So obviously, in our case,
you want to make that as

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.720
small as you can.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.240
SEAN KLASSEN: I think that was
something that we tested a lot

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.380
up front, even before we got
into the interface design

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.466
stuff, because we didn't want
to set up situations--

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:53.880
or at least wanted to minimize
the situations--

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.870
where there would be
that lag time.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:00.400
And we wanted to know how far
we could push that with it

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.520
still feeling like a
nice experience.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.400
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, cool.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.920
Well, why don't we take another
one of the questions

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.170
from there?

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:14.370
Are there going to be more
practical uses for this modern

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.620
technique, do you think?

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.720
I would think so.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:26.030
I mean, Google Creative Labs is
awesome at coming up with

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.070
new ways to push the technology
that's coming out

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.080
in Chrome and just on
the web in general.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:36.150
And hopefully, if we all did
our jobs right, this will

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.300
inspire lots of people to come
up with new, practical ways to

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.000
use this technology.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.240
The game's obviously really fun,
especially it was for us

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.980
to work on.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:49.740
But I think there's a lot
that could be done

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.640
with this for sure.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.512
JUSTIN GITLIN: Gaming
is a great example.

00:14:54.512 --> 00:14:57.770
But yeah, I think there are
plenty of opportunities to

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.750
create new gestures and create
new interactions with the web.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.440
And it's up to us to come
up with those, right?

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.780
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, and that's
one of the cool things about

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.110
Chrome Experiments is they are
designed to make it really

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.120
easy to show developers what is
possible and what's sort of

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.910
available on the web.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.810
I'm kind of curious about one
of the comments in the case

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.950
study that you guys wrote.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.910
And you talked about the
development tools becoming

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.890
more mature for the web.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.730
And you talked about just some
of them that you use, like

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.140
CINEMA 4D and Blender.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.500
What we're some of the other
tools that you liked, and what

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.000
was the part of the Chrome
Developer Tools that you found

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.250
most useful?

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.020
SEAN KLASSEN: I can speak
to some of the other

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.600
applications.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.090
We still used Photoshop to do
the interface stuff, which I

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.210
know some people think is
old school, probably.

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.050
But it still is the best
method for us.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.930
And then I think all the
developers these days are

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.910
using Sublime Text to
edit their code in.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.520
And then when you get into like
the console and stuff in

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.430
Chrome, that's obviously
critical.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.584
Justin probably can speak better
to that than I can.

00:16:13.584 --> 00:16:19.500
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yeah, I think
the biggest tool in the

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.310
developer tools inside of Chrome
was the timeline with

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.130
watching memory usage, just to
make sure that our memory heap

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.870
didn't keep growing beyond
a reasonable boundary.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.590
So that helped just kind
of track down memory

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.450
leaks along the way.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.500
I think when you're running at
60 frames a second inside of a

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.610
video game environment, you
have to be really careful

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.910
about instantiating new objects
and rather reusing

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.690
objects whenever possible and
resetting values rather than

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.020
creating new objects
along the way.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.320
So I think the memory
usage tool is really

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.100
helpful with that.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.160
Obviously, the Network panel
will show you any requests

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.860
coming down, so that was helpful
in kind of reducing

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.290
the overall number
of requests.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.829
So one thing that we did to sort
of minimize the amount of

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.960
requests was Base64 encoding
everything that we possibly

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.819
could that was a reasonable
size to Base64 encode.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:24.010
So any image under around 10 K
in size, we'd Base64 encode

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.930
and put that directly into the
CSS or inline in the HTML as

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.792
an image source attribute.

00:17:31.792 --> 00:17:36.230
As well you can use
Base64-encoded images as

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.790
three.js textures.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.330
So three.js was the 3D library
that we used to create the 3D

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:42.816
environment.

00:17:42.816 --> 00:17:45.330
As well, we Base64 encoded
the fonts.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.450
So pretty much anything that
was going to be an external

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.980
request that was small enough,
we encoded to be inline with

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.380
the CSS or the JavaScript.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.480
PETE LEPAGE: Now I remember
reading in the case study that

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.570
you said in particular with
Base64 encoding the fonts, did

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.960
you Base64 encode both the
different types of fonts?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.990
And if so, do all browsers
download both of those?

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.520
Or do you do some smarts to say,
oh, this browser supports

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.460
this, so I'm going to send only
this type, this browser

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.870
supports this, so
that you reduce

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.763
the size of the download?

00:18:18.763 --> 00:18:21.900
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yeah, all of
the modern browsers should

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.550
download them fine
at this point.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.460
And we did have to do a
little rearranging.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.690
I found one little bug in which
case a certain browser

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:38.140
needed the SVG font listed in
front of the WAF font to draw

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.960
into the canvas context
correctly.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.500
But generally, we used an SVG
font and a WAF font, and that

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.280
seemed to be enough to cover
all the modern browsers.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.780
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.920
Well, why don't we take another
question from our

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.790
Moderator queue?

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.830
And again, the link if you
want to submit your own

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.010
questions is there
on the page.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.430
But did you have any challenges
syncing the devices

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.130
in the screens?

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.760
And this is from
Fred in London.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.460
SEAN KLASSEN: I think the
Google team had that

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.510
theoretically working when
they came to us.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.010
And there was a little
bit of a challenge.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.210
But that was not one of
the harder parts of

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.954
development at all.

00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:26.320
JUSTIN GITLIN: And that system
was built not by us.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.460
It was the development team that
also built the back end

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.840
for the Racer experiment
and the Jam with Chrome

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.370
experiment.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.860
And they've sort of
gotten down to a

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.920
science at this point.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.870
And that all works over
WebSockets once the connection

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.560
is established.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.130
But there is a bit of up front
process that has to happen

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.340
between the two devices.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.140
So there's the code that you get
when you start a game that

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.210
you use to connect the
two devices together.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.400
And there's a bit of back-end
work that goes into generating

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.850
that code, the desktop telling
the back end, OK, we're using

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.740
this code, so give
me a server.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.820
And once you get that server,
that's sort of stored on the

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.210
back end to create the
WebSocket connection.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:17.580
And then on the mobile end, you
enter your code, and the

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:20.880
back end recognizes that code,
sends you back that server,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.960
and that's how both devices
end up with the

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.460
same WebSocket server.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.730
So that upfront process, there
was certainly a bit of

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.080
back-end work that
went into it.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.830
But implementing it from the
front end was pretty easy with

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.400
the API that they had set up.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.570
PETE LEPAGE: Oh nice, nice.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.300
So it was just simply an API
library that you could call

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.640
into and just be like, hey, I
want to go do this, and it

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.730
just worked relatively
easily for you?

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.770
JUSTIN GITLIN: Because the back
end developers were great

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.960
at what they did, definitely.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.540
And that's all built with the
Go language on Google's App

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.480
Engine and Compute Engine.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.050
There's a whole series of
technologies that will create

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.780
like a private WebSocket server
for the two machines

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.670
per game and does a lot load
balancing up front.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:12.390
And one interesting piece of
that equation was that on the

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.440
front end, we would receive a
list of up to three different

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.020
WebSocket servers, and we would
ping each one to try to

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.990
find the closest and fastest
WebSocket server to the user.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.990
So there was some optimization
there to make for the quickest

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.300
experience on the front end.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.500
PETE LEPAGE: Right.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.450
So actually, that leads into
another interesting and I

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.170
think pretty important question
for mobile and just

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.610
for the web today in general.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.640
And that's like, perf
matters, right?

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.130
Like, performance is
really important.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:48.370
How did you guys think about
performance throughout the

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.960
entire building of
this experience?

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.010
SEAN KLASSEN: I'd say that was
really challenging because we

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.010
were using some things that we
hadn't necessarily developed

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.250
any kind of major projects
with before.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:07.200
And luckily, we didn't have to
support every browser out

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.150
there for this because some of
the technologies don't work.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:16.660
But it was something that we
had a balance with just

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.450
building the actual features
themselves.

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:23.590
So even close to launch, we've
noticed some bugs and stuff

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.980
that we've fixed, or just ways
to improve performance.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.440
But there's always room to get
better at that, for sure.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.120
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.160
JUSTIN GITLIN: And I think some
of the things that I ran

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.100
into that were really big hits
on performance were in

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:47.515
three.js, the 3D library, the
more you have loaded into that

00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:49.440
3D environment, the slower
it's going to go.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:55.610
So in the 3D world, the lower
poly you can make your models,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:56.950
the faster it's going
to perform.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.530
So having fewer polygons
in your 3D meshes.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.960
So that's something we went back
and forth a lot between

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.190
the code end and Sean's team,
who were building the 3-D

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.650
models for the skee ball lane
and any other 3D models that

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.240
were in the game.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.470
So there was definitely a bit of
figuring out through their

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.350
tools, like CINEMA 4D and
Blender, on how to reduce the

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.560
polygon count before they
exported those models and sent

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.500
them over to me to drop into
the three.js scene.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.150
Similarly, the physics library
that we were using, Physijs,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:37.180
which is sort of a wrapper
around a 3D physics library

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:42.990
that is really easy to drop
into a three.js scene, the

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.250
more walls that you create that
are physics-enabled, the

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.090
more collision detection
has to happen.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:52.400
So the less processing per
frame in the game that we

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.950
could execute, the better.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:00.640
So we did some manual sort of
creation of the physics scene

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.560
that's invisible to
the user but is--

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.300
like the 3D models that they
see in the game are just a

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.220
facade over some 3D physics
objects that were created

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.650
manually in JavaScript.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.360
PETE LEPAGE: Now did you guys do
any dynamic changing of the

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.730
amount of processing that's done
depending on how fast the

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.790
user's computer is or what
device they're running from or

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.030
anything like that?

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.970
JUSTIN GITLIN: We started to.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.640
So I got into something along
those lines towards the end of

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.060
the project when some older
machines weren't

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:36.990
running quite as well.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:43.310
But it turns out that some of
the aspects of three.js can't

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.340
really be changed on the fly.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.500
And that's kind of what
I was checking.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.880
Like if you were running at 20
frames a second versus 60

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.190
frames a second, I was
trying to drop

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.450
certain lighting or shadowing.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.670
But it turns out that's pretty
hard to achieve without sort

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.540
of rebuilding the entire scene
without those features.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.460
And that's due to three.js
being really good at

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.250
optimizing lighting and building
your shaders once and

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:07.520
storing those on
the video card.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.590
And that's why three.js
runs so quickly.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.500
But it also means that changing
certain things on the

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.710
fly is going to be
really tough.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.920
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah,
that makes sense.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.970
SEAN KLASSEN: And WebGL was
pretty interesting to work

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.910
with, too, because we had to
try and detect a bunch of

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.360
different stuff.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.660
Like some computers will allow
aliasing, some don't.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:36.360
And there's a software component
to it to make it

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.150
work, but there's also
a hardware component.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.560
And we can tell someone to
upgrade their software, but we

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.000
can't get them to upgrade
their hardware.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.950
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah, that's
a little bit harder.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.350
Yeah.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.590
Why don't we take one of the
next questions in the

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.370
Moderator queue?

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.380
And Manuel, again, wants to
know, why didn't Chrome need

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.980
any special permissions to use
the gyroscope without having

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.660
to root the device or
anything like that?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.410
JUSTIN GITLIN: I guess there
are certain things that are

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.910
clearly sort of violations
of somebody's privacy.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.010
If a website's going to access
your camera without asking,

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.110
that shouldn't be allowed.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.900
I think most people would
agree with that.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.950
And we did work with the Google
Creative Lab team to

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.580
make sure that we were not
sending any sensitive user

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.620
data over the connections
because I

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.650
think Google clearly--

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.840
with that process that we had
to go through to sort of

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.130
outline every little bit of
information we're sending from

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.430
machine to machine--

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.540
that there's clearly a lot of
sensitivity to people's

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.490
privacy, which I definitely
appreciate.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.420
And I think you can't really
glean anything from the

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.970
accelerometer about where
someone is or necessarily what

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.915
they're doing, or you
can't really be

00:26:54.915 --> 00:26:56.250
creepy with that data.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:56.840
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.420
Yeah, no, that's very true.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.890
One of the cool things is the
accelerometer, the device

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.120
motion, device orientation
stuff, is all part of the

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.370
standard HTML5 spec.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.360
So that's available to any
developer who wants to build

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.870
for the web.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.980
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah, and I think
Androids and iPhones,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.310
pretty much all smartphones
allow you access to that

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.340
within the browser
now, at least if

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.640
the software's current.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.200
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.060
Actually, that's a
good question.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.480
Did you face any problems in
dealing with the experiment or

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.980
with anything like that, in
dealing with the device

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.880
orientation in device
motion stuff?

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.205
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah, there was
definitely challenges.

00:27:43.205 --> 00:27:43.880
PETE LEPAGE: And I'll
be right back.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.195
SEAN KLASSEN: I think the
biggest thing was doing our

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:51.580
best to normalize the data to
one solution that worked

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.250
across everything that supported
those objects.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.990
Some phones are better
than others.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.810
But I think we came up with a
pretty good way to make it

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:13.347
work across everything
pretty much the same.

00:28:13.347 --> 00:28:14.141
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:28:14.141 --> 00:28:19.330
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yeah, just to
follow up on that, I think

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.640
certain phones will have a
faster rate at which the

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.040
accelerometer updates come in,
or the accelerometer event is

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.340
fired on a window.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.560
So to pick those up at different
intervals, we

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.270
implemented some time stamping
along with each update to

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:37.690
normalize them across devices.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.750
So maybe a device that's running
slower than another

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.630
device will hopefully feel
pretty much the same.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.400
And we definitely went through a
lot of iterations of how the

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.390
swing, like as you swing your
phone to perform the roll

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.650
gesture, we went through a lot
of iterations where we would

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.750
think it felt good, but then
we'd hand it to somebody else

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.280
to beta test, and they just
wouldn't be able to do it.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.210
So there was a lot of sort of
back and forth on watching how

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.660
people picked up a phone and
swung at and adjusting based

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.470
on what we saw.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.890
It's easy as somebody who's
developing something like this

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.270
to get to a point where you
think, oh, this is great.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.380
It works.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.980
And then you hand it to someone
else, and they just

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.740
can't figure it out.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.490
So there was definitely a lot
in terms of making the roll

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:25.290
gestures feel right.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.180
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.325
So another question, this one
actually comes from Paul

00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:32.890
Kinlan, one of the guys on my
team who's based in London.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.700
He wanted to know if there were
any features that don't

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:42.240
exist as part of the Open Web
Platform that you guys would

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.670
have liked to have had, that
would've been useful, that

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.690
would've made building this
experiment easier.

00:29:50.434 --> 00:29:52.850
SEAN KLASSEN: I don't know.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.450
I never even thought about that
because the job from the

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.363
start was to think what can we
do with this technology.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:11.400
But I guess maybe like you're
somewhat limited in the speed

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.350
of your connections and how fast
things return from the

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.480
gyroscope and accelerometers
and stuff.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.636
But I don't know.

00:30:21.636 --> 00:30:23.030
I think it was pretty good.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:23.410
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:24.200
JUSTIN GITLIN: Yeah.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.500
I guess one thing that I could
think of is given that the

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.860
game is based so much on the
WebSocket protocol, and that

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.990
does require obviously going
out to a remote server and

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.570
then coming back into your house
or office or wherever

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:43.850
you're playing, there are
certain corporate offices or

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.340
cell providers that block
WebSockets connections.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.840
So that was a pretty big
challenge that we ran into,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.310
and especially testing that
was really tough.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.660
Somebody testing it may have
been in an office that was

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.720
blocking WebSockets, but we
didn't have access as

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.650
developers to get in there and
actually see what type of

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.400
errors were being thrown or how
that WebSocket connection

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.540
was closing automatically.

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:08.550
So we ran into some
pretty tough

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.940
issues along those lines.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.260
So I think one thing that maybe
would have been cool

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.470
would be to not have to hit a
remote server to have your

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.800
WebSocket connection
established, or maybe some way

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.970
of syncing two devices and
creating that connection

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.000
without having to
hit a server.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.170
That could be cool.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.300
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.140
In fact, that is coming.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.950
That's coming as part of
the new WebRTC APIs.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.140
And they're going to allow
peer to peer connections.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.450
So today by going, you guys have
to go up to the server to

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:38.550
come back down.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.460
With peer connections, you'll
have to go up to a server in

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.680
order to do the initial
handshake and figure out where

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.390
the other user is.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.600
But once you've done that
initial handshake, you can

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.580
connect directly to the other
machine, which means much

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.250
faster connections, no longer
needing to deal with that,

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.840
hey, somebody else might
shut anything down.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:04.620
Much better option, I think,
and a much better future.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:04.910
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:07.260
I think that the WebRTC stuff
is really exciting.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.330
Because you can already see with
our experiment you can

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.300
make stuff feel pretty
real time.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.220
And so you're going to be able
to send so much more

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.790
data back with that.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.560
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.360
And you guys have written a case
study that goes into some

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.530
more technical depth on
some of the stuff

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:25.230
on how you did this.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.190
And you've got some great code
examples and that in there.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.960
I've put the URL on screen
for people to check out.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.470
But you can see that
case study there.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.935
It's on HTML5 Rocks.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:41.570
I think we're down towards
the end of the questions.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.200
Is there anything that you guys
want to add or sort of

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.750
mention before we wrap up?

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:50.940
SEAN KLASSEN: I don't know.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.480
I can't really think
of too much.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.980
I'm thankful for the
opportunity to

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.720
be a part of this.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.220
PETE LEPAGE: Well, it
was a great project.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.750
I think you guys did a really
great job and should be very,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.320
very happy with what you got.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.120
JUSTIN GITLIN: I guess one sort
of thing that I've been

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:09.510
pondering a bit as we've wrapped
it up, I think there

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.160
is something about the
familiarity of skee ball that

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:15.110
I think made this really
successful in the hands of

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.830
people that may not be so
tech-savvy and may not be

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.730
quite as hip to what's hot
and new on the internet.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.425
And that's something we've been
talking about, just why

00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:31.260
do people sort of latch onto
it across the internet.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.160
And I think it's due to some
amount of familiarity wrapped

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.160
into these sort of cutting-edge
technologies.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.990
So I think that's a lesson to
take away just for other sort

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:43.480
of experimentation.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.970
If you can make something that
may be using these new

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.790
technologies that feels so
cutting edge to us web

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:53.330
developers but make it feel not
so intimidating for the

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.580
average user to pick up and
start interacting with, I

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.940
think there's something
to be said for that.

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.170
SEAN KLASSEN: Yeah, I think
that's a good point.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.920
You just have to learn
one new thing.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:05.780
You don't have to learn two or
three or whatever new things.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.810
So that's a lot less
intimidating.

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.670
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.179
Well, I have one last question
for you guys.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.429
What's your high score?

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.449
SEAN KLASSEN: Oh man.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:19.380
I got a fireball on the first
turn of the game once.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:22.070
So I got like 940
or something.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.280
PETE LEPAGE: All right, 940.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:24.710
And Justin?

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:25.620
JUSTIN GITLIN: All right.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.460
I guess I've play this game so
many times that I don't know

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.659
that I have a good
answer for you.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.639
I will say, though, while we
were at the Google I/O

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.820
conference, we had a competition
for how many 100s

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:39.350
we could get in a game.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.010
And Sean and I both tied
at two 100s per game.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.480
PETE LEPAGE: All right.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.380
So just two.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:49.760
So folks who are watching
at home, g.co/rollit.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.946
You've got to beat two
100s in a row.

00:34:52.946 --> 00:34:54.730
SEAN KLASSEN: Oh, just
in the game.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:56.800
PETE LEPAGE: Just in the
game, all right.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.650
Cool.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.660
Well, guys, Sean, Justin,
thank you very much for

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.940
joining us today.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.490
The URL for the documentation is
there that you can go check

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:09.270
out and have a look
at the case study

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.640
that these guys wrote.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.720
And thanks for joining us.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.640
We're going to be back next
week with a special Chrome

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.780
mobile event, where we're going
to be talking about

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:25.210
Chrome Racer and have
the developers

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:26.510
behind that join us.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.450
So with that, I want to say
thanks, everybody, and thanks

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.900
for joining us.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.000
All right, bye guys.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.730
SEAN KLASSEN: Thank you.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:33.980
Bye bye.
