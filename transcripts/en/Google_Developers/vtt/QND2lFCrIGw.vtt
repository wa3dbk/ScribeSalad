00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:01.334
Glazkov: So I'm, um,
[coughs]

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.534
I'm Dimitri Glazkov.

00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:04.300
I've been preparing this
all night.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.000
And I hope this works.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.968
And actually I decided
to do slides

00:00:08.968 --> 00:00:11.300
about 30 minutes ago.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.868
Because I didn't think
that all of this

00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:16.834
can be explained with
enough love and care

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:20.868
by just using, you know,
shooting from the hip.

00:00:20.868 --> 00:00:22.701
So basically there you go.

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:23.901
This is a WebKit.

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.901
It's a rendering engine
that we use.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.734
Obviously
who doesn't know that?

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.534
You're probably
in the wrong spot.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:35.434
Um, and it's a fairly, um,
um, complex piece of code.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.567
And basically
it has the structure

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:38.968
is there's a WebCore

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:42.267
which is where the majority
of rendering occurs.

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:46.133
And then there's JavaScriptCore
which we don't use.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.734
And in JavaScriptCore
there is a subproject,

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.934
or a subset of classes
that's called wtf.

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:54.334
man: Yes, really.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:56.501
Glazkov: Yes, that's really
how it's called.

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.868
And it's a WebCore-type
foundation.

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:03.100
Or WebKit-type foundation.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.300
And then there's some threading
stuff there

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.000
because that was the easiest
place to stick it into.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.667
So you will find some
really interesting nuggets

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.534
of information like this

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:18.400
as you start studying the code.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.501
What am I looking at?

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.033
Should be looking
at everybody.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.734
And so WebCore is where
most of the magic is.

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.868
And then there's WebKit

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:30.033
which is essentially
the glue layer

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:33.567
or the actual port
of WebCore.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.868
And there's one for Mac,
there's one for Qt.

00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:39.868
There's one for Chromium
coming soon.

00:01:39.868 --> 00:01:41.501
And Darin is working on that.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.133
Where's Darin?
Did he leave?

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.267
man: He left.

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:48.734
Glazkov: Now I can bad-mouth
him all I want.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.834
So the directory structure
is also fairly--

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:54.234
if you look at the WebCore
it's fairly straight forward.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.734
Pretty much all the naming
convention

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:02.033
has now been made
pretty much logical.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:03.367
You can kind of understand
what's going on.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:04.767
Like bindings for example

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.234
is where all of the bindings
to JavaScript engines

00:02:08.234 --> 00:02:09.834
or objective c live.

00:02:09.834 --> 00:02:11.767
Dom deals with dom.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.834
Css deals with css.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.300
And so on and so forth.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.501
And so what we do

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.667
is we--we now have
a formal--

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.334
we have a foothold
in WebKit upstream.

00:02:24.334 --> 00:02:26.000
And this is our port

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.701
which is basically
the chromium port.

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:30.033
You will see a bunch
of directories.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.300
Like there's one
for platform chromium.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.200
There's one for graphics
and skier related things.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.434
There's Google URL
that we implement very nicely.

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:42.868
V8 obviously.

00:02:42.868 --> 00:02:44.801
And so this looks
really, really cool

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.501
except have you guys seen--

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.701
Who hasn't seen &lt;i&gt;The Matrix?&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:53.300
Okay.
You haven't seen &lt;i&gt;The Matrix?&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.467
Okay, then this is gonna be
completely irrelevant for you.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:00.434
Have you guys seen one
of those famous action shots

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:03.501
where Keanu Reeves is, like,
you know, dodging bullets

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:04.734
and he's, like, standing
that way?

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:08.400
And if you were to be
introduced to Keanu

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.901
at this particular moment
in time,

00:03:09.901 --> 00:03:12.467
you'd have a very uncomfortable
impression of Keanu

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:15.467
because the guy basically
walks like this.

00:03:15.467 --> 00:03:19.434
And so this is exactly the
impression that you would get

00:03:19.434 --> 00:03:21.200
if you look at our port
right now

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.000
because we are in transition

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.234
and so there's a bunch
of things that are supposed

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:27.133
to be in the right spot
but they're not.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.868
And so we're still moving.

00:03:29.868 --> 00:03:34.467
And so when you go look
at for example v8 bindings,

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:36.133
you'd find that some v8 bindings

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.968
live in upstream proper
and some of them live

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.267
in source WebKit port
bindings v8.

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.300
That's not because
we're so smart.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.667
That's because we are
still working on it.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:49.834
And so a lot of people
get--

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:52.267
I actually was asked
today at lunch

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:53.601
is like, "Why is some files
are there?

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:54.901
Why couldn't you just
move them there?"

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.734
We're working on it right now.

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:58.334
Okay, so this is
a resource constraint.

00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:00.567
This is not a matter of us
picking and choosing

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.300
what things we want to keep
downstream and upstream.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.367
It's all going
to move upstream one day

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:08.934
sooner--sooner or later.

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.467
Hopefully sooner.

00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:14.067
And so we also have now
our own WebKit port

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.200
which Darin has birthed
and now he escaped

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.234
so that he doesn't have
to listen about it.

00:04:19.234 --> 00:04:23.267
But it lives downstream
unfortunately

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:25.434
because it's very hard
to kind of jiggle

00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:28.501
the wires very quickly
and adjust it

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.367
if some breakage occurs.

00:04:30.367 --> 00:04:32.567
And so we build it
downstream

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.267
and then we're gonna move it
upstream wholesale.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:36.267
Hopefully.

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:40.801
And so one of the please that
I have to you, WebKit newbies,

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.067
whoever you are,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:48.300
is if you want to learn WebKit,
please help upstreaming.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.033
So any, um--
any, um--

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.133
Anybody who has extra cycles

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:56.501
or is very actively interested
in learning WebKit,

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:58.467
the bindings for example,

00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:00.167
please help upstreaming.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.267
What it involves is essentially

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:05.734
grabbing a piece of v8 code--
v8 bindings code--

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:09.100
and make it conform
to WebKit code style,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.968
submitting it as a patch
upstream,

00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:12.701
getting it landed.

00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:16.300
And then you'll feel
really, really good, so...

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.501
man: [unintelligible]

00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.033
Glazkov: Yes, and all
these patches count

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:20.634
to your WebKit commuter access.
Exactly.

00:05:20.634 --> 00:05:23.033
So this is all really helpful

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:26.834
it you want to be like
a commuter for example.

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:28.400
And, oh, by the way,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.601
it's not really that much fun

00:05:29.601 --> 00:05:31.567
because sometime you have
to go through

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:33.667
three or four rounds
of iterations

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.067
based mostly on nitpicking
and style

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:40.067
and style violations.

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.467
So it's sometimes very,
very frustrating.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.801
But it teaches you patience,
right?

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.701
This is the most exciting thing
that you can learn.

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.767
Or if you have, like, a kit,
you're done.

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:53.067
You can do it very easily.

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:56.100
Um, so, um--

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.868
We're also in this continuous
effort of trying to unfork

00:05:59.868 --> 00:06:03.167
and move ourselves out
of the situation

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:06.200
where we actually are
a fork or bender branch

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.033
um, of WebKit.

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.234
And this is a very--

00:06:11.234 --> 00:06:14.634
very, um, hard work
and we actually track it

00:06:14.634 --> 00:06:16.267
right here.

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:18.934
As you can see,
this is our current state.

00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:24.167
Just this Monday,
the count was down to 15.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:27.801
And thanks to a merge
that I did on Monday afternoon,

00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.000
it's back to 34.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.601
Because unfortunately sometimes

00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:34.067
the changes made upstream
necessitate a fork

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:36.567
in our, um, in our port.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:39.667
And now I have to go and work
to remove that fork

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.067
which really sucks.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:43.467
But unfortunately
that's what it is.

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:48.067
So we have now removed--
not physically,

00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:50.400
but we removed commit access

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.033
to the third party WebKit

00:06:52.033 --> 00:06:53.901
so we try not to commit there
at all.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.267
Unless this is like
a super-duper regression

00:06:56.267 --> 00:07:01.400
that blocks us from releasing
a div branch

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.701
or div build for example.

00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:04.634
And there's a daily merge.

00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:08.801
So, um, every day somebody,

00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:11.567
some unnamed hero,
takes the changes from upstream

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:16.100
and plops them down
onto our fork

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.801
and it's sometimes a really
hard process

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:19.367
and hair-pulling process

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.567
of figuring out what just
happened

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:24.901
because 100 layout tests just
started failing for no reason.

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:28.534
And so or you need
to start forking things.

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:31.100
But if you really want
to learn WebKit,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.901
this is, like, the best way.

00:07:33.901 --> 00:07:38.701
Because you will daily touch
various parts of code.

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:41.868
And you will have to study
and figure out what's wrong.

00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:44.334
So this is how I learned WebKit

00:07:44.334 --> 00:07:47.133
and I highly recommend it
to anybody...

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.400
um, who wants to be it.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.801
So currently the rotation
is fixed.

00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.901
But, Ian, aren't you working

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:55.033
to make everybody
a WebKit merger?

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:56.167
This is gonna be so great.

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:57.267
It's just like a sheriff.

00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:59.334
Everybody will get to merge.

00:07:59.334 --> 00:08:04.400
Hopefully we'll unfork by then,
but maybe not.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.601
So, um, now I'm gonna talk
about Toolset.

00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:11.734
What we're gonna do for
if you want to work on, um,

00:08:11.734 --> 00:08:14.234
WebKit and that's very simple.

00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:15.601
Just use Git and you're done.

00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:18.767
Um, well actually
it's not that simple.

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:21.801
But one of the things
you have to learn,

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.534
if you're planning to work
on WebKit,

00:08:24.534 --> 00:08:26.501
forget your Windows machine,
okay.

00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:30.334
Working on WebKit upstream
on Windows

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:33.000
is so hard that most of us
have given up.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.400
Peter: By the way,
I still do this.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.734
And I think it's fine.

00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:37.534
So if you want to do this,
you can ask me.

00:08:37.534 --> 00:08:39.901
Glazkov: If you're Peter,
you can still use Windows.

00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:44.167
But Ojohn can tell you that,
um,

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:47.501
none of us, and I repeat--
even you, Peter,

00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:50.234
none of us have been able
to successfully run

00:08:50.234 --> 00:08:54.133
WebKit layout tests
from upstream and succeed.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:57.634
Because that requires pulling
down all of the Mac fonts

00:08:57.634 --> 00:08:59.534
onto a Windows box,

00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:01.000
configuring your clear type

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.234
just the right way,

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:04.934
and all the just weirdness
that comes with it.

00:09:04.934 --> 00:09:07.934
So it's really--
it's really painful.

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:10.501
So if you want to work
with WebKit upstream,

00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.067
this is your great excuse
to get a Mac,

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:15.033
if you want one.

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.467
If you don't want when,
then you know,

00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:19.000
I can't help you, buddy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.734
So using Git is really,
really helpful.

00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:26.501
I have it set up.
Can you guys see it okay?

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:28.868
So I'll show you just
a couple of things

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:30.367
in terms of Git.

00:09:30.367 --> 00:09:32.767
It's very helpful because
it facilitates

00:09:32.767 --> 00:09:34.467
a much better workflow.

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:38.033
Just like on any other product
or perhaps more,

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:41.234
in WebKit you will often
be having

00:09:41.234 --> 00:09:42.634
several patches in flight

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:44.501
while they're waiting review.

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.267
And these patches will have
to be caressed and loved

00:09:47.267 --> 00:09:48.801
a couple of times.

00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:51.167
And so you have to tweak them.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:53.901
So having multiple checkouts
in svn repository

00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:56.200
is just--is just wrong.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.868
So I highly recommend using--

00:09:58.868 --> 00:10:02.167
using like a Git for multiple
branch work flow

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:03.901
where you can have multiple
branches in flight

00:10:03.901 --> 00:10:05.200
and then rebase.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.033
So I'll do a quick demo
if it works, right?

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.801
Ooh.

00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:17.267
So for example I'm--

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:19.601
WebKit comes with some really--

00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:21.200
Git comes with some
really cool stuff

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.067
like, um, shell completion.

00:10:23.067 --> 00:10:24.801
So for example I have it
configured

00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:27.300
so it always shows me
the current branch I'm on.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.567
Which is land which this
is the branch I use

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:31.801
to land somebody else's patches.

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.934
And so, um,

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.167
I can see that there's nothing
going on

00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:39.868
on this branch right now.

00:10:39.868 --> 00:10:41.367
Whoo.

00:10:41.367 --> 00:10:42.501
Back.

00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:44.834
It's really fast.

00:10:44.834 --> 00:10:47.734
And then I can go
to master branch.

00:10:47.734 --> 00:10:51.501
And, uh...

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.968
It's usually much faster.

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:54.701
I promise.

00:10:54.701 --> 00:10:57.334
Let me plug into power.

00:10:57.334 --> 00:10:59.234
Ah, that's okay.

00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:01.968
So then I do a Git pull
for example

00:11:01.968 --> 00:11:07.234
and pull all of the changes
from the, um,

00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:10.334
from my...

00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:12.968
from upstream from
the master branch.

00:11:12.968 --> 00:11:14.968
Downstream--there it is.

00:11:14.968 --> 00:11:20.534
It's happening actually.

00:11:20.534 --> 00:11:21.667
All right.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.567
This shows me what changes
have been made.

00:11:23.567 --> 00:11:25.200
Really nice.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.467
Everything's pretty.

00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:27.701
Uh-huh.

00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:31.634
And then I can say Git
rebase master land

00:11:31.634 --> 00:11:34.667
for example.

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:37.100
And what this does
is it lifts up

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.601
any divs or patches
that I might have

00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:42.400
on land branch,
applies the changes

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.901
that I just pulled
and then attempts

00:11:43.901 --> 00:11:46.767
to land or to apply
the patches that I have

00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:49.801
onto this branch back.

00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.634
And it's a really cool process

00:11:52.634 --> 00:11:54.901
of um, um, kind of a, um,

00:11:54.901 --> 00:11:58.267
patch-based scm.

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:00.601
So I really recommend it
pretty much for anybody

00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:04.400
working on, um, on WebKit.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.667
And like for example,

00:12:05.667 --> 00:12:07.367
one of the things you would see

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:10.434
is I have multiple branches
right there

00:12:10.434 --> 00:12:13.467
and, uh, pretty much like
I have three inspector changes

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:14.968
going on at the same time.

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:18.133
Because sometimes reviewers
take a while to do it.

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:21.000
To go through the process.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.701
And sometimes I need to modify

00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:26.434
and in order to keep sanity,

00:12:26.434 --> 00:12:28.400
I have multiple branches.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.234
And so I could work
on any of this

00:12:32.234 --> 00:12:34.868
separately and then commit
a rebase.

00:12:34.868 --> 00:12:38.834
For more information,
check with Evan.

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:40.767
And he has a--I think
we've taped it, right.

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:43.167
There is a Git talk
that you can go look at.

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:44.767
It's really--it's really great.

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:47.734
One of the things that
is really good

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.968
about WebKit is they have
integrated really well

00:12:51.968 --> 00:12:53.667
with, uh, with Git.

00:12:53.667 --> 00:13:00.567
So their prepare change log
script works with Git,

00:13:00.567 --> 00:13:04.934
and their result change
log script work with Git

00:13:04.934 --> 00:13:06.834
and so svn applied
works with Git.

00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:09.467
So all of these tools
that they have,

00:13:09.467 --> 00:13:11.901
all of the toolset
is in place.

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:15.367
And so I highly recommend
using it

00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:18.801
because it keeps your sanity

00:13:18.801 --> 00:13:22.534
in terms of maintaining
multiple patches in flight.

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.901
And shell completion.

00:13:24.901 --> 00:13:30.334
So if you're ever applying
a patch,

00:13:30.334 --> 00:13:32.067
uh, to WebKit,

00:13:32.067 --> 00:13:33.934
I highly recommend using
svn-apply

00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:37.200
because it does a lot more
smart things

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.100
than, um, than a normal patch.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.067
And it's just wonderful.

00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:44.200
Like for example if you're
applying your old patch

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.634
with a change log entry in it,

00:13:46.634 --> 00:13:49.200
it will automatically put it
on top of the change log

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.367
and change the date
to today's date.

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:53.567
So it's beautiful,
it's gorgeous.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.300
And so I highly recommend
using it.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.901
And of course the whole
collection of scripts there

00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:01.300
that you might look at.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.634
Highly recommend looking
at them

00:14:02.634 --> 00:14:04.300
because I use only three.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.367
But there's more
and you probably could,

00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:09.133
you know, benefit from them
in some way.

00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:13.634
And trac.webkit.org/browser.

00:14:13.634 --> 00:14:15.267
Very helpful tool.

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:18.267
Obviously anybody who used
Trac before

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:20.300
will be familiar with it.

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.300
But it allows you to go
look at the code

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.667
and browse it online.

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:26.501
It's much better than view,
uh, vc--

00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:28.667
whatever that thing we have.

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.634
So if there are any fanatics
of uvc,

00:14:31.634 --> 00:14:35.634
please, I don't mean it.

00:14:35.634 --> 00:14:37.033
Um...

00:14:37.033 --> 00:14:38.801
any questions on Git
or anything?

00:14:38.801 --> 00:14:41.133
Anything I need to pause on?

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:42.133
No?
Okay.

00:14:42.133 --> 00:14:43.501
Yes.

00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:47.701
man: [inaudible]

00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:49.434
Glazkov: Okay.

00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:51.868
Git acts as a really good tool

00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:53.434
if you're using--
if you're on a Mac.

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:57.534
I've never used it
but I heard it's good.

00:14:57.534 --> 00:15:00.434
Um, actually Jeremy there
who makes suggestions,

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:02.367
he's the one who evangelized
me on Git.

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:06.634
And so I owe him a lot.

00:15:06.634 --> 00:15:07.968
WebKit testing.

00:15:07.968 --> 00:15:10.367
How do we test whether
WebKit is good or not,

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.467
whether a specific
variation is good or not?

00:15:12.467 --> 00:15:14.434
Well, the primary test tool,

00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:17.734
the vehicle that they have
upstream is layout tests.

00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:19.767
And you guys are probably
all familiar

00:15:19.767 --> 00:15:21.434
with what layout tests are.

00:15:21.434 --> 00:15:24.968
It's several thousand
HTML files,

00:15:24.968 --> 00:15:29.367
sometimes SVG,
sometimes, um, XML files

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:32.868
that you load in the browser

00:15:32.868 --> 00:15:35.634
and basically look
for a specific behavior.

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.501
And all of this has been
automated.

00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:40.868
Downstream we have test drill

00:15:40.868 --> 00:15:42.901
that allows us to run
the tests.

00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.801
Upstream it's called
dump render tree.

00:15:44.801 --> 00:15:47.100
Highly misnamed,
but you know.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.834
I recommended that they
rename it to test drill.

00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:52.601
They have seemed to be resistant
for some reason.

00:15:52.601 --> 00:15:56.601
And so--and basically
it's really not a very good

00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:59.100
testing methodology
but that's what we have.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.300
Having a unit test
or more extensive methodology

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.734
would probably--

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:08.167
at this point I don't think
it's really feasible.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.767
So we're going with layout
tests.

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:12.234
And layout tests are born how?

00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:14.467
Anytime you find a regression,

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:16.834
whenever you fix a bug,

00:16:16.834 --> 00:16:18.734
you submit a layout test
with it

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:20.801
to make sure that this bug
is now covered.

00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:22.534
And so this is how
you obtain coverage.

00:16:22.534 --> 00:16:26.634
Instead of forward thinking,
you're kind of reacting.

00:16:26.634 --> 00:16:31.267
And...and also there's
a couple of test suites.

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:33.033
W3c suite, 

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.701
Hicksy's svg suite.

00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:37.000
Batik svg--
a bunch of them.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.367
Css suite.

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:40.234
Um, but, um,

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:42.400
those rarely ever fail because

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.734
they're kind of,
you know, simple.

00:16:44.734 --> 00:16:47.234
Not that complicated.

00:16:47.234 --> 00:16:49.300
Not that big of an edge case.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.067
And the obviously we have
reliability tests.

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.934
Chromebot gives us crashes,
which is really great.

00:16:55.934 --> 00:17:00.100
And that's something they don't
have downstream,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.868
so if you're ever in builder--

00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:07.734
By the way, I'm a sheriff today.
Let's see how we're doing.

00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:09.334
Tree's open.

00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:11.968
I don't know if that's because
it's actually open.

00:17:11.968 --> 00:17:13.767
It's okay.

00:17:13.767 --> 00:17:15.067
Or if it's because I'm missing.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:18.000
Nobody closed the tree
for good reason.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.601
[laughs]

00:17:19.601 --> 00:17:22.601
So there are
reliability tests.

00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:24.334
Is that it?
No.

00:17:24.334 --> 00:17:25.734
Is that it?

00:17:25.734 --> 00:17:28.000
That's a really nice bot.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.868
This is your really good
indicator

00:17:29.868 --> 00:17:32.300
of something--
ooh, look at that.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.200
So you would see
that something happened.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.467
For example we have
new crashes.

00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:41.467
And reliability test
uses Chromebot, right?

00:17:41.467 --> 00:17:42.534
Somebody correct me or not.

00:17:42.534 --> 00:17:44.634
All right, it's the same
infrastructure.

00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:46.801
And it just is a really
convenient way

00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:50.334
for you to quickly see
what happened.

00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:53.634
And so you can look
at the stack traces.

00:17:53.634 --> 00:17:56.467
This is something the Mac
people--

00:17:56.467 --> 00:17:58.267
or not Mac people--

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:00.100
what Git upstream does not have.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.601
So we benefit from this because

00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:06.534
we can discover things
that they cannot see.

00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:07.701
So anyway.

00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:10.634
We usually share
those results gladly

00:18:10.634 --> 00:18:12.634
because we need to fix them
as well.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:15.501
And performance tests,

00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:17.267
obviously.

00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:21.167
Who has not seen
performance tests here?

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.901
Do I need to go?

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.501
Look, you guys are fine.

00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:26.133
Okay.

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:28.567
Let me look.
Oh.

00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:30.868
Prf?

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:32.100
Click on prf.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.868
I clicked on prf.

00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:35.701
So you can see very quickly

00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:38.167
how each commit reflects.

00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:40.634
See how great we're doing.

00:18:40.634 --> 00:18:42.167
We have just recently
implemented

00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:44.667
TCMalloc allocator.

00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:50.868
So this brought down
all of our numbers.

00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:54.467
And then we have fixed
a major--

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.901
well not major,
but a bug in v8.

00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:59.634
So this really shows us.

00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:01.200
And when it goes
the opposite way,

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.267
then you're in trouble.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:03.400
You have to fix it.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.033
Peter usually comes
and bugs you

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:07.667
because he really watches
those things.

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.601
Well, he come and bug me.

00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:13.033
Oh.

00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:15.701
So this is real useful

00:19:15.701 --> 00:19:20.033
because it allows you to see,
um, um, what's going on.

00:19:20.033 --> 00:19:22.868
Page cycler--

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:24.634
anybody knows what
page cycler is.

00:19:24.634 --> 00:19:27.868
Has this been covered earlier?

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:29.334
Have you guys been talking?

00:19:29.334 --> 00:19:31.901
Wow, so this is a huge omission
obviously.

00:19:31.901 --> 00:19:34.267
Um...um...

00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:36.534
So page cyclers
are really cool things

00:19:36.534 --> 00:19:39.467
that essentially it's a bunch
of HTML pages

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:42.000
that we run in succession.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.067
And, um, then track
the time memory,

00:19:46.067 --> 00:19:47.901
virtual bites used,
and things like that.

00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:50.501
And so it allows us
to quickly measure

00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:52.701
if something's changed.

00:19:52.701 --> 00:19:56.267
So if there's a regression
then we have to go

00:19:56.267 --> 00:19:57.868
and look at specific versions.

00:19:57.868 --> 00:19:58.868
Like for example, ooh,

00:19:58.868 --> 00:20:00.467
this is a regression
right here.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.000
Let's see what changed it.
Crap!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.968
[laughs]

00:20:03.968 --> 00:20:05.033
My name on it.

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:08.167
This is just expectations.

00:20:08.167 --> 00:20:09.701
So there you go.

00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:12.033
Externalized strings
but not results, blah blah blah.

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:13.334
Non strings.

00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:16.033
So something--you have to look--
oh, and me too.

00:20:16.033 --> 00:20:18.100
Well anyway,

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.234
so any regressions you can
clearly see

00:20:20.234 --> 00:20:21.567
what changes caused it.

00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:23.400
You can see what kind
of regression that is

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.334
by clicking shift.

00:20:26.334 --> 00:20:27.968
Shift.

00:20:27.968 --> 00:20:32.033
Um, no.

00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:33.534
Come on.

00:20:33.534 --> 00:20:36.501
All right, so apparently Safari
doesn't do that.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.267
But you usually can shift click

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:40.868
and you can then track down
and see what percentage

00:20:40.868 --> 00:20:43.601
of regression that is...

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:45.968
And you can see specific
revisions

00:20:45.968 --> 00:20:47.801
that caused the failure.

00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:51.634
And then what is
the orange line?

00:20:51.634 --> 00:20:53.267
That's the reference build.

00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:54.601
What a reference build is

00:20:54.601 --> 00:20:55.801
is that at some point in time

00:20:55.801 --> 00:20:59.434
we took our build that we had
at the time

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:01.701
and put it in a separate
directory

00:21:01.701 --> 00:21:03.467
and now we run it

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:05.567
every time we run
the reliability test

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:09.000
so that we know
that any fluctuation

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.367
in the tests are not caused
by some hardware changes

00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:14.701
or the machine fell ill.

00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:18.000
You can see that if
the ref has not changed

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.133
but the, um, blue line
has changed,

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.267
that means that it's really
a regression.

00:21:22.267 --> 00:21:24.400
Sometimes you would go
in the morning

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.434
and you will see all of them
go down

00:21:26.434 --> 00:21:31.133
because Nikolai has rebooted
the machine

00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:32.367
and suddenly it runs faster.

00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:34.067
But if both of them go
at the same distance,

00:21:34.067 --> 00:21:36.000
you probably go, "Wow, that's
really not a regression

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.267
or anything."

00:21:37.267 --> 00:21:39.067
So that's what reference build
is for.

00:21:39.067 --> 00:21:40.968
That's a great explanation.

00:21:40.968 --> 00:21:42.934
Sorry if I'm fumbling.

00:21:42.934 --> 00:21:46.367
But anyway, this is how
you usually look at WebKit

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:49.501
and see what you've done.

00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:53.100
If you're merging, this is one
of the greatest things

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.000
to watch for because even though
your layout tests

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.400
may be passing,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.634
Dave Hyatt upstream may've
introduced some new code

00:22:01.634 --> 00:22:04.734
that tremendously affects
painting for example.

00:22:04.734 --> 00:22:06.701
And you will see regressions,

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.367
especially during HTML

00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:10.334
[indistinct]

00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:14.501
cycler that affects--that
involves a lot of repainting.

00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:18.434
So you can clearly see
that, oh, something happened.

00:22:18.434 --> 00:22:19.667
These 50 revisions of WebKit

00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:21.868
caused us to regress 30%.

00:22:21.868 --> 00:22:23.601
Roll back.

00:22:23.601 --> 00:22:25.567
We usually just go
and look and see.

00:22:25.567 --> 00:22:27.033
One of the interesting things

00:22:27.033 --> 00:22:29.200
is with sheriffing,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.234
the sheriffs typically don't
roll back the merge.

00:22:31.234 --> 00:22:35.467
So if a specific individual
changed may be rolled back

00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:37.667
but merge is really rolled back.

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:40.968
So it may seem like
a good thing,

00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:42.167
but actually it's a bad thing
because

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:44.133
it puts pressure on you
as a merger

00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:46.968
to go and fix the regression
rather than--

00:22:46.968 --> 00:22:48.901
because nobody wants
your regression,

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:51.167
and yet you must go on.

00:22:51.167 --> 00:22:53.968
So it's--there you go.

00:22:53.968 --> 00:22:57.434
Uh, here's a simple sample.

00:22:57.434 --> 00:22:58.601
Simple sample.

00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:02.667
Bug-fix workflow for WebKit.

00:23:02.667 --> 00:23:04.501
Suppose you're fixing
a WebKit bug.

00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:08.467
This illustrates how inefficient
our system is

00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:09.934
and how much we need
to unfork.

00:23:09.934 --> 00:23:13.100
So typically the way you do it
is like this.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.868
You get your bug fixed locally.

00:23:14.868 --> 00:23:16.801
Reviewed in LGTM.

00:23:16.801 --> 00:23:19.734
Then take that patch,
apply it to WebKit tree.

00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:22.701
Prepare patch.

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:25.567
Then get it reviewed
on WebKit.

00:23:25.567 --> 00:23:27.834
And then submit for review--

00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:31.100
then--then commit
if you have a commit access.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.834
Couple things to mention
is that

00:23:33.834 --> 00:23:37.100
the etiquette of bugzilla

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.667
is that when you attach
a patch,

00:23:39.667 --> 00:23:41.467
don't designate
a specific person.

00:23:41.467 --> 00:23:43.567
Like, you know,
"Oh, Darin is a reviewer.

00:23:43.567 --> 00:23:45.067
I'm gonna ask him to review it."

00:23:45.067 --> 00:23:50.534
This is considered like
a faux pas

00:23:50.534 --> 00:23:53.567
from the WebKit perspective.

00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:55.501
They get angry with us
for some reason.

00:23:55.501 --> 00:24:00.901
So instead I suggest highly
to just CC Darin.

00:24:00.901 --> 00:24:04.367
And he will know.
Stamped to review.

00:24:04.367 --> 00:24:08.067
So anyway, blah.

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:09.701
Are we recording this?
Scratch that.

00:24:09.701 --> 00:24:12.334
[laughs]

00:24:12.334 --> 00:24:15.234
So, um...

00:24:15.234 --> 00:24:17.767
one of the hardest things
by far in WebKit

00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:19.868
is code style.

00:24:19.868 --> 00:24:21.667
It's different.
It's very different.

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.968
Like there is no edit lines.

00:24:23.968 --> 00:24:27.567
The braces for methods
go on the new line.

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:32.367
Four characters--four spaces
rather than two spaces.

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:34.601
Lots of stuff like this.

00:24:34.601 --> 00:24:35.901
Naming members,
variables.

00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:39.200
And believe it or not,
for Googlers,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.100
that was the hardest part.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.467
That always is.

00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:44.767
Because most of the time
your review comes back negative

00:24:44.767 --> 00:24:47.834
only because of, you know,
the style violations.

00:24:47.834 --> 00:24:49.968
So if you've never written
C++ code before,

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:51.200
you're in luck.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.634
You could learn this.

00:24:52.634 --> 00:24:54.067
If you've been a Googler
for five years,

00:24:54.067 --> 00:24:57.567
you're screwed.

00:24:57.567 --> 00:25:01.400
Um, I have five minutes
so I'm gonna rush.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.400
So if you want to talk
to the browser

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.834
in your new code
like you're writing

00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:06.400
web sockets
or something like this,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.467
you need to use ChromiumBridge

00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:13.968
or the new WebKit API
that Darin is cooking currently.

00:25:13.968 --> 00:25:16.000
Since it's in progress
you need to talk to him

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.434
before doing anything.

00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:19.133
Before even considering
design decisions

00:25:19.133 --> 00:25:22.968
because he's the right guy
to discuss these things.

00:25:22.968 --> 00:25:26.667
Um, now, when you--

00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:28.400
if you're considering
making changes to WebKit,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.200
try to put your WebKit hat on

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.400
and think about it this way.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.601
This is not
a Chromium-specific change.

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.367
This is change that should
benefit WebKit as a whole.

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:39.934
So try to avoid making changes

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:42.167
that are just for benefit
of WebKit.

00:25:42.167 --> 00:25:43.667
So if you're writing web sockets

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.934
or a new functionality
like html five forms,

00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:49.334
think of it as this--

00:25:49.334 --> 00:25:52.400
"I'm implementing it
for WebKit, not for Chromium."

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.567
Does that make sense?

00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:56.234
And obviously be aware
of other ports.

00:25:56.234 --> 00:26:00.100
So try not to break Qt
or some other obscure ports

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.000
that are on the build bot.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.968
Becoming a committer
is an easy task.

00:26:04.968 --> 00:26:06.300
It's just ten patches.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.634
And it's something
you definitely

00:26:07.634 --> 00:26:08.934
should consider doing.

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:11.033
It's very easy.

00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:13.300
A couple of upstreaming patches,

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.634
a couple of bug-fixes,
you're there.

00:26:16.634 --> 00:26:18.767
WebKit prides itself
on communication

00:26:18.767 --> 00:26:20.901
so stay open,
participate.

00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:24.367
You guys in Japan
still might consider

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:26.067
going on WebKit,
you'll be surprised

00:26:26.067 --> 00:26:29.033
that you'll find Apple engineers
working at that time

00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:31.601
because they're really,
really weird hours.

00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:33.501
I mean, it's just unbelievable.

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:36.133
And so any proposals,
any ideas?

00:26:36.133 --> 00:26:38.501
Highly recommend to circulate
on webkit-dev

00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:41.200
unless it involves
forking code.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.334
In which case I highly recommend
talking to Ian first.

00:26:45.334 --> 00:26:48.667
And he will triage it
from there.

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:52.200
And so...

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.934
there you go.

00:26:53.934 --> 00:26:56.000
Any questions or comments?

00:27:00.968 --> 00:27:02.767
Done!

00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:04.701
[applause]
