I'm Matt Papakipos.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.901
I run the HTML 5
Open Web platform efforts

00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.734
for Chrome at Google.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.234
I'll be teaching a session
at Google I/O

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.901
about the Open Web platform
in Chrome.

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.400
This is the set of APIs
that Web developers can use

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.400
to implement applications
that do cool stuff.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.934
Our aspiration is to make it

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.400
so that anything you can build
as a desktop application,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.234
you can build
as a Web application, right?

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:30.234
We want Web apps
that are as cool and as capable

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:33.400
as anything you can build
on your computer.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.234
So the sets of things
that we're working on

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:38.734
to make that happen
are video APIs,

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:42.067
2-D and 3-D graphics APIs,

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:46.834
native code execution
systems, um...

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:49.734
systems for doing
background JavaScript threads,

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:51.934
systems for doing
offline applications

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:55.067
that store on the local disk
and sync back to a server.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:57.067
These are apps
that are starting to look

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:59.400
like traditional
native applications,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.834
have all the same capabilities

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.734
and the same performance
and reliability characteristics,

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:05.067
but they run in your browser,

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:08.067
and they have all
the cool properties of Web apps.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.400
You can use them
on whatever computer you're on.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.067
You don't have to install them.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.567
You have extra
security guarantees.

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:18.400
This is why we're trying
to bring the power of the Web

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.067
to the applications
you use every day.

00:01:21.067 --> 00:01:23.834
In the session, we'll talk
about what the APIs are,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.100
what the road map is

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.234
for when we're releasing
all of this in Chrome,

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:29.968
and where we're going
in the future.

00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:30.934
Hope to see you there.
