PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.560
I'd like to welcome you
to this session.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.900
My name is Prakash Hariramani.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm a senior product
manager at Google.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.120
With me is Michael Galpin.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.120
He's the technical lead for a
very exciting product we're

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.650
going to be announcing today.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.240
And I'm also honored to have
Jonathan Taylor, who is VP of

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700
mobile at Priceline.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.360
And he is going to be talking
about something

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.820
very exciting, too.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.380
So we are very happy because
we are able to announce a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.970
great product for mobile
commerce today called Google

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.610
Wallet Instant Buy.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.220
And as you'll see, it's going to
help your users, consumers

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.880
be able to buy physical
goods and services in

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.720
a much easier way.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.050
So before we get into the
product details, we thought we

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.900
should look at things
in perspective.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.280
Today, when we look at a rotary
dial phone, we laugh,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.000
especially when we have our
nice, shiny Android devices

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
next to us.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
And we believe that the state of
mobile commerce today when

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.350
we take a step back maybe in
the future and look back to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.940
where we are today, that's
how we'll look at

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.020
the state of mCommerce.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.890
So what is the state
of mCommerce today?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.260
Unfortunately, it's a
very painful state.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.420
For many of you who have tried
to make a purchase on a mobile

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.080
device, the average person goes
through 24 plus steps

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.880
because you have to enter your
billing information.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.730
And, god forbid, if you're
shipping information is

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.680
different from your billing
information, you have to enter

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.920
more keystrokes.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.390
And then not to mention that
many sites require you to set

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.180
up a username and password,
log in.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.350
And then you add all these steps
up, you could easily

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.990
have 100 keystrokes, friction,
which leads to abandonment,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.730
which means you don't have
high conversion rates.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.570
And one of the stats that's
staggering is the purchase

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.070
abandonment rate with
mobile commerce.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.830
So 97% percent of users abandon
a purchase midstream.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.480
And just to, again, take a step
back, mobile commerce is

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.259
growing at 100% year
over year.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.830
So the question we ask ourselves
is, how much more

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.030
could this market be growing if
we were able to reduce or

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.720
eliminate this friction?

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.850
And that's where Google Wallet
Instant Buy comes in.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.860
So how are we addressing
this pain point?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.150
So there's a couple
of ways we're

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.020
addressing this pain point.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.650
One is we want to have faster
checkout for physical goods

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.070
and services.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.330
So as many of you know, by
virtue of having an Android

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.890
phone, you have Android Play on
it, the Android Play Store.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.720
And many of you have, hopefully,
made a purchase on

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.880
Android Play.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.030
By virtue of making that
purchase, you've set up a

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.190
Google Wallet.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.880
And now that you already have
the Google Wallet set up, you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.400
can use that same wallet for
making a purchase of physical

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.210
goods and services or,
for example, buying

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.730
something on Priceline.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.040
So we reduce one friction pain
point, which is removing the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560
pain of entering your billing
and payment information.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.920
The other pain point
we covered was

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.450
registration and login.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.580
And I think many of you
may have attended

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.590
the G+ sessions already.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.710
That's a great way to remove
this pain point.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.810
Not only can you avoid the users
from having to set up a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.490
different username and password,
we can also share

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.290
profile information, so
you can make it a more

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.740
personalized experience when
a user comes in to log in.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.690
So speed is everything in
mCommerce And I think,

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.260
hopefully, you are getting
the message.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.470
If you do step 1 and 2, you make
checkout fast and easy.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.870
And it's all about speed when it
comes to mCommerce Security

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.280
is something that we are
very passionate about.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.520
And there's one traditional
misconception out there that

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.530
security and convenience
are a zero-sum game.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.290
We think that's a
false choice.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.920
We think you can raise the
bar on both security and

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.890
convenience.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.720
And we have done that with
Google Wallet Instant Buy.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.040
So what are we doing
about security?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.430
We did a couple things.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.410
One is, every time you make
a purchase, we generate a

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.620
one-time virtual card.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.560
This other thing we do is we
have a Google Wallet Purchase

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.820
Protection Program.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.690
So your users, your consumers
of your application, have a

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.640
peace of mind that any
unauthorized purchase is

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.690
something they don't need
to worry about.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.420
And most importantly, we have
risk-based authentication.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.310
So when you have an Android
device, you're already logged

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.550
into the device.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.980
We don't ask you to enter your
username and password.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.290
But we do have a very
sophisticated risk engine that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.700
will challenge your user if
it gets a risk signal.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.650
There's two other points which
I'll just touch on, but

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.050
Michael's going to cover in
more detail, which relate

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.140
around lightweight
integration.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.620
And the reason for that is
because our integration is

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.340
client-to-client, so
there's no back-end

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.990
elongated server process.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.180
But you don't have to
take my word for it.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.140
Jonathan and team and the other
launch partners, you can

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.880
talk to them directly.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.730
And they'll talk about
their experience.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.060
And finally, we don't charge
any additional fees.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.530
If you use Google Wallet, you
continue to use your existing

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.980
payment processor.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.410
Google doesn't charge
any additional

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.660
fees on top of that.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.910
So how does the product work?

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.500
So this is actually from
our sample application.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.980
And for those of you who will
use our SDK will also get the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.130
source code for the sample
application.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.190
So the typical purchase process
starts with the screen

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.020
on the left.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.520
So I go to Checkout.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.470
And I've chosen what I want
to buy, it's a Cannon.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.800
I'm going to invoke the Buy
With Google Wallet button.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.610
So typically, you would place
the Buy With Google Wallet

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.540
button at Checkout.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.830
And when I do that, it
brings up the middle

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.990
screen that you see.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.830
It's what we called
the Chooser.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.180
This is the Google Wallet
Instant Buy Chooser.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.910
So I mentioned earlier to you
all that if you've used Play,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.670
by virtue of using that, you've
set up an account, a

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.940
Google Wallet account.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.340
So let's say, I set up a Google
Wallet account and I

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.460
had MasterCard as my funding
instrument or what we call

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.060
your backing card, that's
what's going to show up.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.930
That's the MasterCard you see
where it says Pay To.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.200
You can change it to another
source, if you want.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.500
It also has my shipping
address below.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.340
So because it already got this
from my Play account, I don't

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.080
have to go through the
frictional pain point of

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.390
entering it again.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.060
I also want to draw your
attention to the check box.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.180
This is what we call
pre-authorization.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.730
This is very important because
if your user checks this box

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.010
and gives consent, next time
when that same user comes back

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.770
to your application, they
can skip the screen.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.440
So it makes it a 2-tap
purchase process.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.360
Once the Chooser comes up after
the user gives consent,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.390
we pass control back to your
site, which is the

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.640
screen on the right.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.315
We also do what's called
a Masked Wallet.

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:53.530
So essentially, we pass to you
the last four digits of the

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.400
funding instrument, which is the
MasterCard ending in 5417,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.980
and the shipping address.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.440
And as far as you're concerned
as a developer or merchant,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.610
it's as if the user
had typed it in.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.900
When the user hits Confirm
Order, then we pass what's

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.750
called a Full Wallet, which
has that one time virtual

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.430
MasterCard I talked about.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.480
And the beauty about this is
you don't have to make any

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.270
changes downstream from your
payment processing

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.950
perspective.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.400
What I mean by that is it's as
if I had typed a MasterCard in

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.110
a mobile commerce site.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.320
So again, it's very powerful
because it goes back to

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.570
lightweight integration.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.130
So we thought it would be good
if we could have Jonathan now

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.400
demonstrate what I've been
talking about and give a demo

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.800
of Priceline and talk about
his experience integrating

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.770
with Instant Buy.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.680
Jonathan, over to you.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680
JONATHAN TAYLOR: OK, Prakash,
thanks very much.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.890
We'll switch over to the wolf.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.150
Well, at Priceline, we are all
about bringing great travel

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.390
deals to our customers.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.150
And we're especially interested
in making it fast

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.440
and easy for our customers to
book a great hotel room at a

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.710
great rate from their
mobile device.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.820
Now, as Prakash mentions,
speed is everything.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.000
Speed always wins.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.140
And this is a very important
differentiator for us.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.100
We want to make it as quick
and easy to check out on

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.540
Priceline with the Android
app as we can.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.100
So we have teamed up with Google
to introduce a Full

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.540
Google Wallet integration
into our Android app.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.390
And I'll give you an example
of how that works.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.310
But first, I'll say that a wise
man once gave me some

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.370
advice, which is, Jonathan,
never do a live demo on a

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.590
wireless network.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.450
So with that sage advice in
mind, we will do a live demo

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.280
on a wireless network.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.590
JONATHAN TAYLOR: So let's
imagine that I'm a brand-new

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.690
Priceline customer.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.620
I've just downloaded and
installed the brand-new

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.780
Priceline app, which we've just
released today from the

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.280
Play Store.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.680
And I'll bring it up.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.930
And I had this idea that since
we have this great spring

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.760
weather here on the West Coast,
I'll extend my vacation

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.370
a little bit and book a great
hotel room down the coast in

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.620
Monterey this weekend.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.340
So we'll choose the
Hotel section from

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.050
the Priceline app.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.490
Rather than San Francisco, we'll
choose Monterey, which

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.400
we've recently chosen.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.500
And we'll check in on Saturday
the 18th and

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.800
check out on the 19th.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.300
We'll choose one room and
do a search for that.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.450
So let's see what's available
in Monterey this weekend.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.290
The Priceline app is searching
for all the available rooms

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.275
and rates among all the
available hotels in Monterey.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:34.970
And hopefully, we'll have
the results shortly.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.600
Here we go.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.770
A couple of good
choices there.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.855
I think we'll pick the Hyatt
Regency Monterey.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.770
We can browse through
the hotel amenities,

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.090
look at some pictures.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.940
We can look at guest reviews and
just get a general idea of

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.190
what the hotel looks like.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.850
And this is the normal checkout
flow for hotel.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.850
And again, I'm a first-time
customer.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.530
So I have not yet chosen my
Google Sign-in or my Google

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.036
Wallet method of payment.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.115
We may need to switch
wireless networks.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:31.730
Here we go.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.460
No, we didn't quite make it.

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.780
Let me take this off
for a second and

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.030
we'll switch networks.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.400
Almost there.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.650
And there we go.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:24.110
That looks a little
bit better.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.360
The orientation, right?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.830
And we have the details
on our selection.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.350
So we'll choose Book Now.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.440
We'll choose a great room,
coming up here, a king bed.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.090
And we have a brand-new option
in our checkout options now,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.670
which is a Sign-in
with Google.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.860
So this is the Google single
sign-on option.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.610
We choose Sign-in with Google.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.160
And immediately, we'll be asked
to have the app-granted

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.480
permission do a couple things
in our Google profile--

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.160
access to the Wallet information
and access to the

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.460
basic profile information.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.390
We'll say OK for that.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.510
And what will happen is it will
choose Google Wallet as

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.850
our default method
of payment now.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.250
And this is the regular Google
Wallet payment selector, which

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.080
Mike will talk about
in a minute.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.060
And very importantly, we're
going to choose the box that

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.730
Prakash mentioned, which is to
use Google Wallet to pay for

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.740
future purchases.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.740
So the number of taps the next
time through the application

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.400
is greatly diminished.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.860
We'll say OK for that.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.560
And right away, we have our
summary of charges, we have

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.300
our payment method as Google
Wallet is preselected.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.920
It's copied the payment
information and billing

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.730
information from the wallet.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.000
And we can go ahead
and book now.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.540
We have just done our first
Priceline hotel booking using

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.940
Google Wallet.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.500
Now, the good news is that
I'm a repeat customer.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.440
And I come back through the
application the second time.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.220
The number of taps required to
check out is even less because

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.430
I've signed in with Google,
which is sticky.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.310
And I've chosen Google
Wallet as my

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.290
default method of payment.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.990
So then I come back through
the app and decide to book

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.570
maybe another weekend
in Monterey.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.470
I'll show you how much faster
it is the second time,

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.540
especially now that we have
a great Wi-Fi network

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.790
[CHUCKLES].

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.305
Again, we'll choose our hotel
from the available hotels.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.385
Let's try the Casa Munras.

00:13:25.385 --> 00:13:26.440
We'll say Book Now.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.380
And again, we'll choose our best
rate available or choose

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.330
a room and rate combination
that we like.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.320
We'll choose this Queen Room.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.710
And this time through, we go
directly into Google Wallet

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.140
because we're signed in to
Google, we've chosen Google

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:48.820
Wallet as our method
of payment.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.470
And immediately, we have our
payment method selected.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.070
All we need to do
is say Book Now.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.840
We've made our second booking
on Priceline.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.570
This time, much faster.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.570
So we've greatly improved
the checkout flow

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.810
for Priceline customers.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:05.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.780
JONATHAN TAYLOR: Now, the good
news is that the points of

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.870
integration from the app to the
Google Play services are

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.970
pretty straightforward.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.440
And as Prakash mentioned, our
payment back-end systems are

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.530
changed very little because we
actually have a full-fledged

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.840
card number to pass
through to it.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.930
And Mike will talk a little bit
more about the details of

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.220
integration.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.660
But now, I'll turn it back
over to Prakash.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.240
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank
you, Jonathan.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.930
That was great.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.170
I should have mentioned this
earlier, but if you see

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.780
anything that excites you, feel
free to applaud at any

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.640
point in this presentation.

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.540
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So with
that, on the spirit of

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.240
applause, I think we
need to applaud

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.150
all our launch partners.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.320
We are very grateful.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.990
We have a great roster of
partners who have launched

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.830
Google Wallet Instant Buy.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.460
And just to make a shameless
plug, we have a blog post that

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.790
was released at noon.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:54.090
And you will be able to test
those applications out.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.040
So the partners we have launched
with today are

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:04.630
Airbnb, Expedia, FANCY, GIGYA,
GoPago, NFC Task 10,

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.840
Priceline, of course, Rue La
La, Booking.com, Tabbedout,

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.510
Uber, and Wrapp.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.450
What I'd really encourage
everybody to do is download

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.730
these apps and experience
the great

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.790
mCommerce experience yourself.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.240
So for example, if you haven't
made vacation plans for

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.980
summer, I'd encourage you to try
out Priceline and make a

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.880
booking just like
Jonathan did.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.930
We have a slew of other
travel partners, too.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:32.750
If you want to try a local San
Francisco eatery, Bistro

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.640
Burger, I'd encourage you
to download GoPago.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.520
Install it and order ahead.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.570
I'd also encourage you to--

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.250
when you go to some of the
after-session festivities

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.540
they've organized--

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.700
call Uber for a cab ride so
you can drive home safely.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.150
The other thing I want to
emphasize is we have many of

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.220
these partners in the Google
Wallet Sandbox area.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.140
So I'd really encourage
everybody to show up there if

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.060
you're interested in this
product and talk to the

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.550
developers and partners
directly.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.380
So with that, I'm going to turn
this over to Michael, who

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.960
is going to walk you through the
rest of the presentation.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.080
MICHAEL GALPIN: Thanks,
Prakash.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.070
No more demos, I swear.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:16.010
It's really humbling to see
the list of partners out

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:21.210
there, a lot of great apps
using our software.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.410
Hopefully, after you saw the
Priceline demo, you'll agree

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.650
it's a great experience
for your customers.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.350
But you, guys, are developers.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.450
You, guys, want to know
how this works.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.700
So let's take a look.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.030
So this is the Instant
Buy flow.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.130
And you'll notice there's a fork
at the top of this flow

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.300
chart here.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.380
And that corresponds to the
first time versus subsequent

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.690
times a user uses Instant
Buy in your application.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.300
There's four steps involved.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.270
The first is getting
a Masked Wallet.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.050
As Prakash mentioned earlier,
a Masked Wallet is just a

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.260
description of the payment
instrument the user's going to

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.300
use for the transaction.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.470
So if you use something, like
MasterCard 1234, so the last

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.089
four digits, just enough
information for the user to

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.390
identify the instrument.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.890
But it's not the full
16 digits to it.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.170
And it also includes
a shipping address.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.540
So when you get a Masked Wallet,
the first time a user

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.579
uses Instant Buy with your
application, you're going to

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.940
need to show the
Instant Buy UI.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:32.110
So that's the right side
of the fork here.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.250
That's the Chooser UI that
you saw earlier.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.460
It shows the given instruments
the user has.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.030
So if they've bought something
on Google Play, maybe they

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.740
bought an app, you'll see
the credit card there.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.360
If they've bought a Nexus 7,
you'll see the shipping

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.740
address that they shipped it
to will be listed there.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.760
So they can select what they
want to use there.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.090
And then you'll be given
the Masked Wallet data.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.560
And with that, you want
to update your UI.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.040
The first thing you probably
want to do is calculate the

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.225
sales tax, calculate the
shipping costs, and show that

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:07.900
to your user.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.320
You probably also want to show
the Masked Wallet information

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.620
to the user so they know, OK,
it's this card that's going to

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.270
get charged, it's this
address where things

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.790
are going to be sent.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.290
Once they're happy with it,
then they can confirm the

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.240
transaction.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.050
And that's when you
get a Full Wallet.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.940
That Full Wallet is just like
a Masked Wallet, but it also

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.350
includes this generated virtual
card that you can then

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.400
turn around, send to your
back-end systems for payment

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.650
processing.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.850
So we'll go into some more
detail in these steps here.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.250
I was really hoping Jonathan
would give us the source code

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.750
to Priceline, and we could
look at some of that.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.235
But instead, we'll have to
settle for our sample app.

00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:50.630
As Prakash mentioned earlier,
it's a sample application, all

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.440
the source code comes
with the SDK.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.580
So you, guys, can take
a look at it.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.920
On this screen, the only thing
you see going on is this Buy

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.620
With Google button.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.660
It's important for your
users to see that.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.540
It lets them know that, hey,
I'm going to use Google to

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.590
complete this purchase.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.640
It's very reassuring to them.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.350
But behind the scenes, there's
even more going on.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.460
Behind the scenes, the
application is establishing a

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.780
connection to Instant Buy.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.020
Now, that sounds kind
of strange.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.370
So maybe you might want
to know what's

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.620
going on with that.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.730
Well, to understand that, let's
look at the Instant Buy

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:26.430
architecture.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.390
Instant Buy is a component
of Google Play Services.

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.090
You might have heard about
Google Play Services earlier

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.620
today in the keynote.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.330
It's been out for
almost a year.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.630
So you might have, actually,
already be using it.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.180
Its a push to all Android
devices running 4EO or higher.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.220
That includes all those
Gingerbread devices.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.300
And they have the Play Store.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.820
To integrate with Instant Buy,
all you have to do is compile

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.190
in the Play Services client
library into your application.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:03.240
That client library is a very
thin client library.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.980
The bulk of the code is part
of the Play Services APK,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.570
which runs in a separate
process.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.090
And it's because it's running
in a separate process is why

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.750
you have to create this
connection between your

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.125
application and the Play
Services process.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.740
So creating that connection,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.420
First, you want to create an
instance of WalletClient.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.410
This is really the main entry
point into Instant Buy.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.420
It's the object that has all the
APIs you are going to use.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.750
Creating one is pretty
straightforward.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:34.110
You pass on an activity
through it.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.360
You pass on the constants
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.700
environment.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.950
We have a test environment we
call Sandbox where you can use

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.760
fake credit card numbers,
so you can test all your

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.646
integration without actually
having to spend money.

00:20:44.646 --> 00:20:48.900
You can specify an account that
ties into single sign-on,

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.400
which we mentioned earlier.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.280
And I'll go into more
detail soon.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.930
And a couple of callbacks.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.750
The first is this connection
callback, which is going to

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.160
receive life cycle events for
your connection to the Play

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.500
Services APK.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.950
So it's going to receive events,
like onConnected or

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.240
onDisconnected.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.460
And finally, there's
a FailureListener.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.540
If for some reason, you can't
establish the connection, that

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.580
listener gets notified
of that.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.340
Once you've created the instance
of the WalletClient,

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.980
then you just call connect.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.250
That's an asynchronous call,
just like all the other APIs

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.500
in Instant Buy.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.170
So now, you're ready to
get a Masked Wallet.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.960
There's a few things you need
to figure out before you

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.930
request a Masked Wallet.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.490
Do you need a full
billing address?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.815
Do you need a shipping
address?

00:21:33.815 --> 00:21:35.900
Do you need the user's
phone number?

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.200
We really wanted to make Instant
Buy fit in with your

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.210
existing checkout flow.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.870
So if you ask for a full billing
address, then you tell

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.620
Instant Buy you need a
full billing address.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.520
If you only ask for a minimal
billing address-- so

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.970
basically, just a zip code of
their billing address--

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.580
then you can tell Instant
Buy that.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.220
And that's all we'll ask
the user for as well.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.550
So once you got all these
things figured out, then

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.700
you're ready to create a request
for a Masked Wallet.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.870
So when you want to do that
is when your connection

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:10.980
callback's onConnected
method gets invoked.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.160
That tells you that the
connections have been

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.315
established with Instant Buy.

00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:15.460
And it's safe to call
other APIs.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.700
So to build your
MaskedWalletRequest, we have a

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.770
very convenient builder
you can use.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.710
And this is just where you
set all the options.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.770
Like here, I'm saying I need
a shipping address.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.470
When you want to set your
options, you call .build, and

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:34.330
you got a request ready to go.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.630
You take that request and you
call the loadMaskedWallet

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.310
method on the wallet client.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.970
You also pass a listener
to this.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.960
This API dimension, like all the
others, is asynchronous.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.850
So you pass a listener, that
gets invoked once, the data's

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.400
returned back from Google.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.620
At this point, the first-time
users use Instant Buy in your

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:00.250
application, you need to show
the Instant Buy UI.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.150
You're going to get a callback
here that will receive a

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.760
ConnectionResult.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.860
If you happen to have used any
of the other parts of a Google

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.340
Play Services, that
ConnectionResult object should

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.380
be familiar to you already as
it's used through all the

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.430
different components.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.110
It basically has a success
or failure method.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.240
And in our case, success means
you've got data as a response

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.580
to the request you made.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.130
And there's no UI to show.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.560
So that corresponds to the
pre-authorization case for the

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.820
subsequent times a user uses
Instant Buy in your

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.410
application.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.260
Failure, while that sounds kind
of harsh, it just means

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.890
that we couldn't return
the data to you yet.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.770
You need to show the
Instant Buy UI.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.810
To show the Instant Buy UI, we
rely on the startActivityFor

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:45.140
Result/onActivityResult
paradigm.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.650
It's very common in Android
development.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:55.030
To show the Instant Buy UI,
the listener you passed

00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:02.130
through onMaskedWalletLoaded
method that will get invoked.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.780
It gets passed a
ConnectionResult and a

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.940
MaskedWallet.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.390
So you check if it was
a success or not.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.930
If it was a success, then
you got data back

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.540
from Instant Buy.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.450
And now, you're ready to
update your UI with the

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.810
MaskedWallet data.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:21.340
If it wasn't a success, it was
a failure, then it needs

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.000
resolution.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.630
That means you need to show
the Instant Buy UI.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.130
Typically, you'll probably
want to put that behind a

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.740
button, probably that Buy
With Google button.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.360
So that's what we did
in this case.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.700
We created a button.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.580
And when it gets clicked,
then we call the

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.020
startResolutionForResult method
on ConnectionResult.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.370
As I mentioned,
ConnectionResult.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.880
is actually used throughout
our Play Services.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:48.090
And when there is resolution,
it's basically wrapping a

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.820
pending intent behind it.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.800
So it's turning around and
calling startActivityForResult

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.420
using that pending attempt.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.980
So just like anything else,
when you use that

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.220
startActivityForResult paradigm,
your activity's

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.880
onActivityResult method will be
called once the Instant Buy

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.130
UI has been dismissed.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.860
So if everything went smoothly,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.150
you'll get a RESULT_OK.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.820
This is the standard result
you'd see in Android

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.330
development.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.640
In that case, you can pull the
MaskedWallet data out of the

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.400
intent passed to you
on ActivityResult.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.960
And then you're ready
to update your UI.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:32.910
If there was a problem, like
say, there was a network

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:37.220
connection issue, then you can
pull the errorCode out.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.080
We have a list of error codes
in our documentation so that

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.310
you know what each of this
error codes mean.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.015
And you can decide how to deal
with it in your application.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.830
So now, you've got the Masked
Wallet data, you're

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:51.940
ready to use it.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.560
You're ready to update
your UI.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.830
So you want to calculate the
sales tax and shipping, update

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.990
the totals for the transaction,
so the user sees

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.850
how much they are
going to pay.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.630
You want to show the Masked
Wallet information, so the

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.930
description of the payment
instrument that's going to get

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.000
charged for this transaction
and the address things are

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.380
going to get shipped to.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.740
And you should give your users
a chance to change this in

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.750
case they made a mistake.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.370
Finally, you'll provide
a Confirmation button.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.040
So once the user is happy with
their choices, they can

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.800
confirm the order.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.600
When they confirm the order,
that's when you're ready to

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.520
get a Full Wallet.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.250
So to get a Full Wallet, it's
very similar to getting a

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.450
Masked Wallet.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.960
First, you build a
FullWalletRequest.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.010
One thing I want to note here
is setting the Google

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.450
Transaction ID.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:44.850
That's an ID that you're going
to get in the Masked Wallet

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.230
that gets returned to you.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.280
And it lets us tie together this
FullWalletRequest to the

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.540
Masked Wallet we sent
earlier, so we know

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.780
which card to charge.

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.350
You can set some other option,
like the total price, line

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.510
items in the cart.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.930
And then you could build
your request.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:04.800
And then you pass that to
loadFullWallet , another API

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.370
on WalletClient.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:08.460
And just like with
loadMaskedWallet, you'll pass

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.620
a listener to that as well.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.060
That listener will have a single
method through the

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.010
implement onFullWalletLoaded.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.200
And it follows a very similar
pattern that we saw,

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.880
onMaskedWalletLoaded.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.720
You get a ConnectionResult
passed to you in

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.880
a fullWallet object.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.260
You check if the result was a
success, in which case the

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.810
fullWallet object passed
you will not be Null.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.200
And you can use it to send
to your back-end.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.530
There is a chance that it
could require resolution

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.200
without a success.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.090
This would happen if for some
reason we thought there was

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.690
something fraudulent about the
transaction, and we wanted to

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.360
challenge the user to confirm
their identity.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.130
So in that case, you do a
startResolutionForResult, just

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.820
like you did with the Masked
Wallet request.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.940
At this point, you're now
accepting Google Wallet.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.470
So we'll just go over the
steps again real quick.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:07.770
The first thing you want to do
is you get a Masked Wallet.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.610
That is a description of the
payment instrument that's

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.920
going to be charged for the
user, so something like

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.516
MasterCard 1234, plus their
shipping address.

00:28:17.516 --> 00:28:20.880
If you're ready to show the
Instant Buy UI, the first time

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.190
a user uses Instant Buy in your
application, they'll need

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.230
to show you the Instant Buy UI,
so they can pick what card

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.560
they want to use, pick
which address.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.000
They can change these things.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.250
And that's where they get the
option to use Google Wallet as

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.890
their default payment method
for future transactions.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.620
Finally, once the user is happy
with things, and they've

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.870
confirmed they want to pursue
the transaction, that's when

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.120
you get a Full Wallet.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.210
Before moving on and talking
about single sign-on and

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.010
security, I want to mention
there's a few more Instant Buy

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.300
sessions at I/O this week.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.010
Later today, there's session
called Building Compelling

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:00.810
mCommerce Experiences
on Android.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.080
That's being given by two of the
engineers on the Instant

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.510
Buy team, plus an engineer
from the FANCY.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.260
So I really I recommend
you attend that.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.670
They've got a lot of great
tips, even some tips that

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.530
aren't necessarily particular to
mCommerce, but for Android

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.540
applications in general.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.260
Finally, to really get into the
details of Instant Buy, we

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.310
have a Code Lab on Friday.

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.640
In the Code Lab, you get a
chance to integrate Instant

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.180
Buy into an existing
application.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.560
Myself and several other Instant
Buy engineers will be

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.020
TAs for the Code Lab.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.280
So I hope to see you them.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.280
We talked about the faster
checkout part and how that

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.550
gets implemented.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.030
We want to go back to single
sign-on, eliminating

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.770
registration and login
for users.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.462
On here, you see a couple of
screen shot from the FANCY.

00:29:56.462 --> 00:29:58.160
It's an app you might
have seen from the

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.770
keynote this morning.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.590
On the screen on the left, you
see the FANCY with a couple of

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.580
sign-in options here.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.740
The top one is a sign-in
with Google.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.060
There's a couple of other
buttons on there I'm not as

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.350
familiar with.

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.540
I'm sure your users will hit
that big, beautiful red button

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.810
at the top, though.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.200
And then they'll get the
screen on the right.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.510
They're already signed in
through their Android device,

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.810
so they don't have to enter in
a name and password to sign

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:24.050
with Google.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.210
Instead, they just have to
authorize your application to

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:28.460
use Google.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.850
But wait, there's more.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.040
Once you have a sign-in with
Google+, there's some extra

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.670
benefits you get from this.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.810
And one of those is
social sharing.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:46.570
So on these screens, on the far
left, I am posting through

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.990
my G+ account about a
shaved ice machine I

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.740
bought on the FANCY.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.040
I really love shaved ice.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.740
And who doesn't?

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.300
That's what I wrote
in the post.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.230
The middle screen is how the
post will appear to my friends

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.420
when they see it on G+.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.980
So they can see my
comment about it.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.140
They can see a description
and a picture.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.710
But most importantly, they
see a Buy button

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.000
right there on G+.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.700
If they press that Buy button
and they already have the

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.030
FANCY on their device, they'll
be taken directly to the

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.710
shaved ice machine listing
in the FANCY.

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.200
And there they have a Buy Now
option with Google Wallet.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.160
And they'll go into
the Chooser.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.620
And they'll be able to complete
the transaction very

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.400
quickly as we see.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.790
If they don't have the FANCY
installed, they'll be taken to

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.410
the Play Store where they
get a chance to

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.660
download the FANCY.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.195
So with social sharing, you can
really drive downloads of

00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:44.265
the application and
engagement.

00:31:44.265 --> 00:31:46.780
And with Instant Buy, turn all
that into convergence.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.330
Tomorrow, there's a Google+ Sign
In for Android Developers

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.250
session that goes into a lot
more detail on how Google+

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.500
Sign In works.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.070
I know earlier Prakash mentioned
security and how

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.910
Instant Buy makes things
more secure.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.840
And I'm sure all the developers
in the room were

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.630
shaking their heads going,
I don't trust the product

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.490
manager talking about
security.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.480
But he was telling the truth.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.520
Let me explain.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.290
So Instant Buy is easier
and more secure.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.150
And we've seen the easier
parts already.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.650
How is it more secure?

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.960
Well, we don't actually share
the full credit card

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.800
information with anybody.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.860
Consumers are always hearing
about some big corporations

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.640
leaking user data, including
credit cards.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.610
And so you can't blame them if
they have a lot of anxiety

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.370
about sharing their credit card
information with some app

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.380
they just downloaded.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.460
So we can eliminate
that anxiety.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.380
They don't have to share
that full information.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.260
They've already got their
information with Google.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.700
So they can just
leverage that.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.280
Further, the credit cards that
we generate have a limit on

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.120
them that is closely tied to
the amount specified in the

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.620
FullWalletRequest.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.520
So once they've been used for
a transaction, there's not

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.190
much money left on the cards.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.820
So even if they were compromised
in some way,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.390
there's not much damage
that can be done.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.240
Further, they have an expiration
date that is

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.100
closely tied to when the
card was issued.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.670
So there's really only a small
window where any problems

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.030
could happen.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.980
Now you, guys, might be
wondering, is that going to

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.850
cause some complications
for us, these

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:29.040
generated virtual cards?

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.150
But the answer is no.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.390
The card we give you is a
MasterCard just like any other

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.670
MasterCard.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.890
So you can charge it just like
you would have if a user had

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:39.140
entered it by hand.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.770
Every transaction made with
Instant Buy is also backed by

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.150
the Google risk engine because
data we get is not the only

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:52.070
thing users have
to worry about.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.750
Crunching big numbers is
something that Google

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.410
is very good at.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.260
And we use that capability.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.070
We analyze each transaction and
challenge if we need to.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.770
We're so confident in our
ability to detect fraud, we

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.020
offer the Google Wallet
Purchase Protection.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.500
So any purchases made using
Instant Buy are guaranteed for

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.690
180 days after the purchase.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:14.840
So again, this removed even
more anxiety for users and

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.115
helped them feel better about
making purchases.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.359
I'm going to wrap up
now and turn things

00:34:23.359 --> 00:34:24.230
back over to Prakash.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.880
He can tell you how you can
get access to Instant Buy.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.040
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank
you, Michael.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.550
So I just wanted to recap what
we talked about earlier today.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.610
We talked about fast
and easy checkout.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.650
One thing I should mention is
we commissioned Mercator

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:39.110
Advisory Group, which is an
independent payments and

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.469
consulting firm.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:44.080
And they said, when compared to
other digital wallets and

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.380
when compared to credit cards,
Google Wallet Instant Buy was

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.360
the fastest and easiest
way to checkout on

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.980
native Android apps.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.050
So we talked about skipping
registration and

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.909
sign-in with G+.

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.980
Michael talked about security,
kept me honest.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.500
And then we talked about
lightweight integration and

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.160
the fact that we don't charge
any additional fees.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:07.740
So I think many of you are
thinking now, I'm interested

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.010
in this product.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:09.900
How do I sign up?

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.880
What's next?

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.170
Well, this product is in
limited availability.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.090
If you are interested, what we
would encourage you to do is

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:18.710
complete the Interest form.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.880
The link is here.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.400
We'd also be in the Office Hours
section right after this

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.490
to address any questions
you have.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:27.120
If you fill out the Interest
form, we'll get back to you

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:28.380
very promptly.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:31.910
And finally, I want to emphasize
that only sign up if

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.740
you're selling physical goods
and services on Android.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:40.470
So we'll turn it over to Q&amp;A.
But one more thing.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:41.840
You've been a great audience.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.810
And when I see around, I see
many familiar faces.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:49.330
Many of you have been dedicated
partners integrated

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.960
with Google Wallet
Instant Buy.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.350
So we really feel we
should reward you.

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.880
So with that, I'm going to
turn it over to Peter

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.575
Hazlehurst, who is director
of product management.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.370
PETER HAZLEHURST: Hi.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:01.360
Thanks a lot, Prakash.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.400
Awesome demos, guys.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.950
Fantastic.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.180
As some of you may have caught
the fact that we stealthily

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.590
announced a new product
at about noon today.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.920
And that product is
the ability to

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.930
send money in Gmail.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.250
And one of the really awesome
things about it is all you do

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:21.270
is, as long as you have a
wallet, you just click the

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.360
Attach Money button, attach
money like you would attach a

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:27.800
photo, and off the email
goes to the recipient.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.310
If the recipient doesn't have
a wallet, we automatically

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:32.420
help them through the
sign-up process.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.660
They get a wallet, they
receive their funds.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.030
Everything's done and dusted.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.350
It's really, really simple.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:41.230
And it's just what you'd expect
from us in terms of our

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.000
integration with Gmail,
simplicity of the wallet, and

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.150
a great user story.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.020
So we thought really hard about
how do we grow this

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.750
system and get people
using it.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.840
And instead of the traditional
blast it out and everybody

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.180
gets it, we're doing something
a little special.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.230
We're going to make this
a viral launch.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.870
And the way the virality works
is if you have money, you can

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.110
send money.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:07.600
And that seems rather stingy if
you guys don't have money.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.700
So I went to my bank account and
figured out a way to send

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:14.240
all of you $10.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.650
So in, plus or minus, a few
minutes from now, you should

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.030
receive an email from me saying,
"Welcome to send money

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.590
with Gmail.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.930
And $10 is in your Google
Wallet." If you don't have

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.280
one, go get one.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.550
And then if you're watching on
the Livestream and you want

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.430
access to send money in Gmail,
please find one of your

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.570
friends here at Google I/O
because that's the only way

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.300
you get it.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.360
So please help us grow
the business.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.830
And look forward to sharing
and sending

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.630
money across the net.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:44.866
Thank you very much.

00:37:44.866 --> 00:37:51.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.310
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Thank you, Peter.

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:55.450
So we'd like to open the floor
for question and answers.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.320
And just a housekeeping note,
I know it's less than two

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.830
minutes to go, but we
don't want to cut

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:01.010
this discussion short.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:03.700
So like I said earlier, right
after this presentation,

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.740
Michael and I will be
at the Office Hours

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.090
section in the Sandbox.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:08.990
But why don't we take a few
questions in the remaining

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.320
time we have?

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.070
Go ahead, please.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:16.650
Actually, yes, please go to the
microphone because this is

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.730
being live streamed.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:20.590
So we want everybody on the
Livestream to be able to

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.422
listen to the question.

00:38:22.422 --> 00:38:25.522
AUDIENCE: So I'll go because
I'm at the mic.

00:38:25.522 --> 00:38:28.130
Jeff from Opera.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.840
Congratulations on how far this
is coming and how much

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.310
easier it is for publishers and

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.530
e-commerce players to integrate.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.210
Earlier in the keynote, you
talked about an HTML5 spec for

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.140
auto-complete on wallet, in
Chrome, and all that.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.390
How do the two products
fit together?

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:43.640
Could you just repeat that?

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.050
MICHAEL GALPIN: So the product
shown in the keynote, Auto

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:56.370
Checkout, is for web pages, a
way to fill out these long

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.090
payment forms on web pages.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.260
This is for native Android
applications.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.370
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:07.280
You said you only have
it available for

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.470
products and services.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:12.220
When will it be available for,
like golden sites, like

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.210
documents or videos or images
that you want to sell online?

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.720
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Yes, if I
heard the question correctly,

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:19.560
if you're selling these little
golden services, we have a

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.360
great product already, Android
In-app Billing.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.940
So I'd encourage you to use
Android In-app Billing if you

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.170
are selling a product which
involve these little goods

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.660
that are consumed on
or off the device.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.860
AUDIENCE: Quick question here.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.790
Is any geographic limitations
as far as support or added

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.310
currencies and countries yet?

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:37.710
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Great question.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:40.060
Actually, this product which I
mentioned before is we are

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.100
focused on the US right now.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.000
So we do plan to expand
in the future.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.110
But for now, the main
focus is the US.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.285
So you need to be a US seller
and a US merchant.

00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:49.680
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.560
The second question is around
the funding source.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.010
You referred to using a credit
card to back a credit card

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.550
transaction.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.000
How about other funding source,
like a debit account

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.040
or a PayPal account or something
along those lines?

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:02.250
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.330
So today we support credit
cards from all the major

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.480
network brands as a
funding source.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:10.470
We don't support links to
a bank account today.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.320
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.290
I have a few questions,
actually.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:16.560
The first one, charge-backs.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.510
How you handle them?

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.170
Like do I, as a developer,
get charge-backs?

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.250
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: That's
a great question.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.810
And I'm glad you asked that
because this goes back to what

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.800
we said that we have minimum
impacts [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.000
You, as a developer or merchant,
would handle that

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.340
charge-back exactly the way
you handle a MasterCard

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.680
charge-back today.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.400
It's as if I entered
my MasterCard

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.810
number on your site.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:39.650
And if it was disputed, you
follow the exact same process.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.460
No changes.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.990
AUDIENCE: And how about
if I wanted to use in

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.750
my app other forms?

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.950
So if I want to choose Paypal
and Google Wallet, am I

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.370
allowed to do that?

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.370
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So we have
our UI branding guidelines.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.980
We know, again, it's consumer
choice and merchant choice.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.170
But, yeah, you can use other
payment methods.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.440
But we'd encourage you to look
at Google Wallet Instant Buy

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.480
and the SDK, and then make
an informed decision.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.030
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:08.920
Thanks.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.480
MICHAEL GALPIN: We'll
take any more

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.080
questions out at the Sandbox.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:13.680
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Thank you.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.930
[APPLAUSE]
