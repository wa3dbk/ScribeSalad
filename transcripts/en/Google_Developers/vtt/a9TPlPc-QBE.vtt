ALI AFSHAR: Hi everyone.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.240
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.075
My name's Ali.

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:13.030
STEVE BAZYL: And I'm Steve.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.630
ALI AFSHAR: And today we're
going to be talking to you

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.570
about all the exciting
things going on at

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.750
Google I/O this year.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.070
If you don't know Google I/O,
it's our main developer

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.030
conference, and we're really
excited about it.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.510
So, if you want a quick overview
of what we're doing

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.000
at Google Drive, then make sure
you go to the Google I/O

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.480
website, which has the sessions
listed on there, and

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.370
you can see that now.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.440
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, so if you
haven't checked that out yet,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.710
I want to give you a couple
highlights of some of those

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.150
sessions that we're doing
related to Google Drive.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.040
There's one which is a You're
On With Drive SDK.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.580
This is with Nicholas.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.740
And he is just going to review
all the changes since last

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.130
year's I/O. There's been a lot
of developments with the SDK.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.150
And for those who just want to
catch up, it's a great talk.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.350
There will be a few others.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.700
I'm doing one with Josh
Hudgens, who 's our PM

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.480
on the Drive SDK.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.110
And we're going to talk about
some of the momentum that

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.040
we've seen over the last year,
the growth in drive apps, and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.170
how you, as a developer, can
take advantage of that.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.300
Brian and Cheryl, who were on
GDL a few weeks ago talking

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.520
about the real time API,
are going to do a deep

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.870
dive into that API.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.950
It's actually a really good
talk for those who are

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.750
interested in how that
technology works.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.860
Very technical.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.360
Very interesting talk.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350
They're also going to do a code
lab on Friday, the last

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.950
day of I/O, where you can play
with the real time API and

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.490
learn how to build an app.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.260
There are several talks on Apps
Scripts, and how Apps

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.120
Scripts integrates with
Google Drive.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.410
You can do things like
automating Google Docs, and

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.970
also build drive apps using
the Apps Script APIs.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.335
And Ali, I think you're doing
one on app data, right?

00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:49.130
And Android development.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.372
ALI AFSHAR: That's right.

00:01:50.372 --> 00:01:51.730
Plug for my talk.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.580
I think Drive's a really
great solution for

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.060
storing files on Android.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.970
And we're going to talk about
the various ways you can do

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.280
that, and why you
should do that.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.050
So, come along to that
talk as well.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.420
Thanks, Steve.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.870
STEVE BAZYL: And there are a few
more that will be on the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.580
schedule as I/O appears
to get closer.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.060
But those are being kept
a little quiet for now.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.930
But check them out.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.200
Really exciting stuff coming.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.810
And, of course, you can always
come and watch the sessions.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.870
You're encouraged to.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.700
If you happen to miss one of
them, but you want to ask

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.780
questions, you can stop
by the Office Hours.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.280
After each talk, the speakers
are going to be there.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.040
And you can come and get more
information, or ask questions,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.000
for whatever you need.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.620
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, and we love
talking to you guys.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.230
So, please come along.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.240
You can't stop us from talking
about programming, and the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.420
various things involved
with Google Drive.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.900
So, please, please just come
along there and see us.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.830
Now, if you haven't got
a ticket, don't worry.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.410
There are many ways you can
still get involved.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.590
We have Google I/O Extended.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.830
Now, that's hundreds of places
where people have organized to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.700
have events around I/O. So, if
you have one local to you,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.800
then please get involved
there.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.890
You can see the map
of all the places.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.480
And, again, that's on our
Google I/O website.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.650
STEVE BAZYL: And people are
watching these live, right?

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.976
So people in Sydney, you're
going to be watching at two or

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:09.700
three in the morning.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.270
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, it's a
pretty fun occasion.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.010
So if you can get involved
there, I certainly would.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.900
And, again, even if you can't
make that, don't worry.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.800
We're recording all
these sessions.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.550
And we're live streaming a
number of them, as well, on

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.630
Google Developers Live.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.390
So, if you come here while
you're watching this site, you

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.680
can see all the sessions
that you miss.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.000
Even if you go to the conference
and you miss some

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.805
sessions because of conflicts,
you can always catch up there.

00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:37.810
STEVE BAZYL: And if you are
going to be at I/O, I

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.230
definitely encourage
you to check out

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.570
the Developer Sandbox.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.810
This is near the Office
Hours, as well.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.460
And there will be 24 different
developers who have built apps

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.690
around Google Apps, including
Drive, and Apps Script, and a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.230
few other APIs.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.380
And check these out.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.550
The list of developers that will
be on there is going to

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.340
be available later today.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.770
I don't want to spoil the
surprise too much.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.140
But there's some really
cool apps in there.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.770
These people are building really
innovative things.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.210
We have a broad set from desktop
applications, to

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.500
hardware, to web apps, some
really interesting

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.820
integrations with Apps Script.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.090
And these are all developers.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.060
So you come by, ask them about
their implementation.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.110
They can answer questions.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.420
Give you some advice on how
to make your applications

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.490
integrate really nice.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.550
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, and
also ask them why.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.130
What did Google Drive
integration for their apps,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.460
what did that do for
their business?

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.790
Because that's really
important.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.040
We want you to make money.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.600
And these are people who are
making good money out of

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.970
having Google Drive
integration.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.590
So, come along and say
hello to them.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.670
And lastly, some fun stuff.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.650
So, of course, we'll be having
the usual set of tastefully

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.700
branded merchandise with
the Google Drive logo.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.450
So, come along and get that, if
you come and see us in the

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.700
Sandbox or the Office Hours.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.027
And in addition to that this
year, we're having prizes for

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:58.190
posts to the community.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.570
So, every day at I/O, we'll be
giving a special prize to one

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.320
post from someone who's at I/O.
And if you're not at I/O,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.870
don't worry.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.340
You can still win a prize for
a post to the community from

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.600
someone who's not at I/O.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.910
So, make a post.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.310
Make it the most interesting
thing you can--

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.290
something you learned, something
you'd like to know.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.840
We'll be giving a prize out
for the best one of these.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.710
Just tag your post with Drive
I/O hashtag, and everything

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.890
else will fall into place.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.110
So, come, win those prizes.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.560
We're really excited
to see you there.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.630
STEVE BAZYL: Yep, it's going
to be a great time.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.380
We're really looking
forward to it.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.800
And if you're going to be there,
definitely stop by and

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.540
say hello to us at
the Office Hours.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.890
Stop by the sessions.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.510
And check out the developers
in the Sandbox And, of

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.650
course, have fun.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.630
ALI AFSHAR: Yeah, awesome.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:44.780
Definitely have fun.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.725
Enjoy yourselves at I/O.
So, we'll see you

00:05:46.725 --> 00:05:47.580
there, if you're coming.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.190
If not, hopefully next year.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.176
STEVE BAZYL: Thank you.

00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:51.426
ALI AFSHAR: Thanks all.
