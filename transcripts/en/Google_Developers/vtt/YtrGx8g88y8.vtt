IDO GREEN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.300
I'm Ido Green and I'm a
Developer Advocate.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.190
DANNY HERMES: And I'm Danny
Hermes, Developer Programs

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.360
Engineer, working on the
cloud app engine.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.530
And we're here to show you our
demo, which yesterday, it was

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.215
an offline demo.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.070
It actually never wanted
to come online.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.240
So if you want to see the full
talk, check out the link at

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.550
the bottom of this video.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.420
The talk was "Mobile Web and the
Cloud, the Triple Crown of

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.000
Modern Applications".

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.450
And so here we go,
on to the demo.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.970
Let's jump on to the device.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.740
Let's see it, Ido.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.280
IDO GREEN: Great.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.470
So we have here a mobile
web application.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.730
And first thing we need just
to authenticate our users.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.670
So we sign in with G+, which
is extremely easy, and you

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.190
could check the code
on GitHub.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.070
I'm accepting the confirmation
dialog here.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.930
And now when I'm back, you
could see a few things.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.170
One, the sign-in button
vanished.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.400
And the app itself now made a
connection to the server and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.710
brought us all the nice
pictures that we took

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.820
beforehand.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.510
Now as you can see, I have
here this crucial

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.420
functionality to add photos.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.980
And here natively, in the
browser, I can just click on

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.760
Take Photo.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.520
And very nicely, I'll try
to give you a view

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.570
of what we are seeing.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.180
And you could see that
the photo loaded.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.930
I can just give it a name.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.660
Google.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.410
DANNY HERMES: Yeah, a great
photo of the studio we're

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.170
filming in.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.994
IDO GREEN: GDL.

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:27.186
And I can save it.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.140
Now when I was saving it, a
few things happened in the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.670
background.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.400
First thing, and the most
important one, is that we got

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.840
a confirmation first
that the photo

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.470
itself was saved locally.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.520
Then we got a confirmation that
the photo was sent to the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.540
cloud to our one source of
true that we want to have

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.370
there, so we could see it
on different devices.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.120
DANNY HERMES: So if we switch
to the laptop, where our

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.740
wonderful user Wadsworth Testing
10 has already signed

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.000
in, and I refresh this page,
we wait a little bit and we

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.870
actually see that photo there
on another device.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.900
So heading back to
the device--

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.010
IDO GREEN: Now let's take
it to the next level.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.940
As we spoke yesterday, we want
to make sure that our app will

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.850
be productive and could let the
user work when we don't

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.850
have any connection, or we
have flaky connections.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.510
So here I'll do something
quite brave.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.590
And just remember that
we are in a browser.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.310
I'm just now releasing
the connection.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.730
And you could see up on the top
left corner that we have

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.400
the offline indicator, and
we are now offline.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.160
And I can still go,
add a photo.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.250
Take another nice photo
of our studio here.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.800
And a few things will
happen now.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.700
So I captured a photo.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.130
I can give it a quick
name and a quick

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.640
description, and save it.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.930
Now when I'm saving it right
now, you could see that on get

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.250
confirmation immediately
that the photo itself

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.410
is now saved locally.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.950
DANNY HERMES: But if we switch
over to the laptop--

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.480
IDO GREEN: --the magic
will happen.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.350
DANNY HERMES: --and we try to
refresh, we will see, we don't

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.780
have the photo yet.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.370
But if we go back--

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.230
IDO GREEN: Now let's go
back to the tablet.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.520
And you could see that then once
I'm switching and hooking

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.700
it back and giving it a
connection, first you see the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.530
indicator on the top changing
from red to green and ready.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.410
And now our photo is being
sent to the cloud.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.180
DANNY HERMES: Sent
to the cloud.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.040
So if we check out one last time
on Wadsworth Testing 10's

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.480
laptop, and we refresh it and we
wait a bit, we actually got

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.600
that connection back
and we see it.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.180
So that concludes our demo.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.020
Thank you for stopping here.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.800
Again, I encourage you to
go see the whole talk.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.670
But chances are, you actually
came here from

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.690
the original talk.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.850
I hope you enjoyed this.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.210
And we hope you'll check out
some of the other videos from

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.020
Google I/O.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.730
IDO GREEN: Absolutely.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.880
And check in the latest and
greatest in HTML5 [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.010
dot com, and build
amazing web apps.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.260
Thank you.
