PAUL KINLAN: Hi.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.180
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.780
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
I work on Chrome, and
I've briefly worked

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.900
on the Web Lab project.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.930
I'm here with two of the
engineers behind Web Lab, as

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.220
well, Roger and Mattias.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.860
Do you want to give yourself a
little bit of an introduction?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.710
ROGER PALA: I'm Roger.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.260
I'm a creative technologist at
B-Reel, and I've been the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.410
technical lead of the project.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.680
MATTIAS EKENDAHL:
And I'm Mattias.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.875
I am also a technical
creative.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.300
Do you say that?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.710
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.150
PAUL KINLAN: It's either a
creative technical or a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.770
technical creative.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.740
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: I don't
know the difference.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.320
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.540
I'm an instrument technician not
a-- oh it doesn't matter.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.716
I'm a technical supervisor not
a supervising technician.

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.412
Instrument technician,
that was my dad.

00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:15.260
That's my dad's job.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.350
Anyway, sorry.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010
So we're here to talk about the
Web Lab project Web Lab is

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.550
a series of five real-world
Chrome experiments inside the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.450
British Science Museum
in London.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.280
And over the series of a couple
of Hangouts, we've

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.770
basically been introducing
each of the experiments.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.670
So today's is the Teleporter
experiment.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.590
And the Teleporter
is really cool.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.660
It's basically three
Teleporters, three periscopes

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.260
inside the museum, essentially,
which you can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.390
move along or move
around and be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.500
transported across the world.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.560
I think we've got one in a shark
tank in South Africa.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.390
So we've got a camera, a
360-degree camera, inside the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.700
shark tank.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.390
One in a miniature world in--

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.615
where is it?

00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:57.660
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Hamburg.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.060
PAUL KINLAN: In Hamburg.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.030
And then one in the bakery just

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.790
outside New York, I think.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.620
Isn't it?

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.060
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.170
A 24-hour bakery.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
a 24-hour bakery.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.120
It's pretty cool.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.840
The really cool thing I like
about this experiment--

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.775
obviously, it's very physical,
even though everything about

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:13.350
it is digital--

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.405
but when you get online you
still get this very similar

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.160
type of experience.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.760
So just some of this--

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.460
I took my son to the British
Science Museum and we went on

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.635
[? the site to ?] play
with it, took

00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:24.960
photos of where we were.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.730
I mean, he had no idea where
the places were, but he was

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.410
like, this is so cool.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.790
It's like they're working
in the bakery.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.640
I said, yeah, they've
woken up.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.490
It was 6 o'clock in the morning,
and it's guys in the

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.910
bakery just pounding dough
and everything.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610
It was pretty crazy.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.790
But anyway, let's jump
into the experiment.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.950
So this is the main screen
giving you an introduction

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.740
about what it looks like
inside the museum.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.180
So these are the periscopes,
at least.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.010
I have a little theme.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.970
For every single Hangout
that we've done--

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.190
I told you about the loading
screens-- and this

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.220
was Flash as well.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.470
Was it originally Flash
convergences?

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.330
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: To a Swiffy.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.160
PAUL KINLAN: To a Swiffy.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.120
So it's all in HTML5
in JavaScript, but

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.460
via the Flash process.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.870
I get that in every time.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.040
It's something I learned just
from this past week.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.330
It's pretty crazy.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.360
So this is the actual Teleporter
project on the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.640
website, which gives you pretty
much the exact same

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.065
experience that you get
at the museum, right?

00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:16.500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yep.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.720
PAUL KINLAN: So we have
the three cameras.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.060
We have this one here on the
left, which is the deli.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.850
Hover over it.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.860
That's a pretty cool transition,
wasn't it?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.110
This is the miniature world in
Hamburg, and then this is the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.660
rather dark, nighttime
aquatic museum in

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.960
South Africa, at least.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.515
I think we'll just go with the
bakery one for most of this

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:37.110
with this Hangout.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.821
It's got a lot of
stuff happening.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.580
Oh, that was really cool.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.600
Did you see that drop
off the screen then?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.230
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.613
This is just from other people,
they are taking.

00:03:45.613 --> 00:03:47.190
PAUL KINLAN: Sorry, that's
the first time

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.530
I've ever seen that.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.030
So basically what happens with
the Teleporter is that you can

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.340
take snapshots at the museum
or online as well, right?

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.750
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.570
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.430
PAUL KINLAN: And they get
recorded to your lab tag, so

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.440
when you go home you can get
them back and see what you

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.550
recorded and print it out.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.840
So should we just jump on this
and have a brief technical

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.610
deep dive into what people are
seeing right now, and why

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.280
we've got donuts.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.262
I mean, are these real donuts?

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:15.626
No, they're not real donuts,
but it's kind of crazy.

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:19.565
Should we start a different
way instead?

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.120
How can I say this?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.980
There can be 10,000 people,
20,000 people at any one time

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.180
controlling these
cameras, right?

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.030
So should we jump into one?

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.530
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.900
PAUL KINLAN: Because
I want to show the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.710
people what's happening.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.220
So this is the actual museum.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.836
This is the bakery just
outside New York.

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:38.420
Is it Amelie's Bakery?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.970
ROGER PALA: Right.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.940
PAUL KINLAN: That's cool.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.290
And as we can see the camera
is moving around.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.250
This is not the actual
camera moving is it?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.890
ROGER PALA: No.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.260
So we have a 360 camera on site,
and then it sends the

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.350
whole 360 panoramic view through
a WebM Live Streaming.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.720
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, it's
a WebM Live Stream.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.560
ROGER PALA: Yeah, so we don't
use any plug-in for this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.380
experiment.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.580
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.386
So this is just literally the
video tag mapped on to--

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:09.310
I'm presuming this
is WebGL, is it?

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.085
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:13.950
So we receive this video
in the web of

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.700
an HTML video, basically.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.550
It's like an infinite
HTML video.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.200
And then we get this
data and we--

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.520
with a WebGL shader--

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.930
we transform it, and so--

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.045
PAUL KINLAN: So when you say
transform it, do you map it on

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.280
to the inside of a sphere
or something?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.780
ROGER PALA: It's not actually a
sphere, it's just a fragment

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.810
shader that repositions each
of the pixels as--

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.975
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so it's
manipulating where the pixels

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:40.160
are to make it look like
it's kind of--

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.310
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.280
PAUL KINLAN: --or re-combine
this at [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.320
ROGER PALA: To get the
experience of the sphere.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.800
PAUL KINLAN: That's
interesting.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.320
I always thought you mapped
on to one texture.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.290
You put on to the inside of a
sphere, then you move the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.840
sphere around.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.670
But it's even a little more
method than that.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.790
You use a fragment shader.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.170
See I was talking to
Paul Lewis the

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.270
other week about this.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.460
I was calling them vertex--

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.820
I swear they were called
Vertex Shaders.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.130
Maybe it's DirectX
or something.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.140
And he's like, no, Paul, they're
fragment shaders.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.170
He's like, huh.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.410
That's how much I know
about know about web

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.860
[? geologists,?] generally.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.240
So this is scrolling around, but
we do get the ability to

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.630
move around ourselves.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.090
So we're not like a normal
webcam from the 1990s where

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.360
you would wait in the queue
for a minute and a half to

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.050
pass off, and then two seconds
later it would move up.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.540
And you get complete control
of the webcam because it's

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.450
entirely virtual, right?

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.990
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.040
PAUL KINLAN: The projection
onside the

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.550
screen is entirely virtual.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.715
It's a 360-degree camera.

00:06:32.715 --> 00:06:34.080
That's pretty cool.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.110
So I wonder what they're
making now?

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Brownies
or something.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.180
They really look good.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.952
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, they
look really nice.

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:42.305
So if we wanted to, we could
take a snapshot, right?

00:06:42.305 --> 00:06:42.640
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.205
PAUL KINLAN: Press the
space bar, it will

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:45.680
take a snapshot itself.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.540
That's pretty cool.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.960
So this kind of compass in the
background, I mean, is that

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.980
WebGL as well or--

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.930
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No,
that's actually SVG.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.870
That's generated in real time,
so it's creating the tags as

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.650
you turn around.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.710
PAUL KINLAN: Oh right, so it's
not even already pre-created.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.850
It's like a big, long screen
that creates the individual

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.050
items and then positions
the text.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.110
Oh wow, okay.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.380
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's creating
all in real time.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.280
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.375
And how did you get this-- is
this bend effect here-- is

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:21.360
this part of the actual
fragment shader or--

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.810
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: No.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.470
The shader does much, but
just that effect, we

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.240
used the CSS mask.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.470
PAUL KINLAN: OK, so you're
clipping off a region around

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.860
to give it.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.920
That's pretty nice
stuff, isn't it?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.410
Cool.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.910
And I have a silly question.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.640
This is going to sound
stupid, so excuse me,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.470
everyone, if it is.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.610
This halo effect,
is that just--

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.525
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's an SVG
overlaying the whole thing.

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:48.190
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.156
So it's like you have
it in a pastie?

00:07:50.156 --> 00:07:50.500
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.850
PAUL KINLAN: And then you go
to transparent or opaque?

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.580
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.540
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.610
We have someone looking
through the

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.406
window, and he's waving.

00:07:58.406 --> 00:07:58.852
Hello.

00:07:58.852 --> 00:07:59.744
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:59.744 --> 00:08:02.770
PAUL KINLAN: So this is how
we record these things.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:03.690
It's pretty cool.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.040
We go with the flow,
see how it goes.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.210
So what were some of the
technical challenges that you

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.700
faced with this project?

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.410
ROGER PALA: So I would say that
the WebM Live Streaming

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.170
was quite challenging on the
back end, because, as far as

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.550
we know, it's the first time
that someone used this

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.860
technology.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.600
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.896
I don't think we've ever made
any announcement or anything

00:08:24.896 --> 00:08:30.298
that we actually are streaming
web and video over the--

00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:31.593
we haven't.

00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:32.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.760
PAUL KINLAN: It's
breaking news.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.789
This might be cut out.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:35.609
We don't know.

00:08:35.609 --> 00:08:39.340
ROGER PALA: But obviously, like
with any new technology,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.380
it's been quite challenging
to handle all the errors.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.070
PAUL KINLAN: That's interesting
because, a lot of

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.180
the time that we've done
this, it's been a

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.930
YouTube Live Stream.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.920
But I presume we couldn't
pipe the data--

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.920
the 360-degree camera data--

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.050
into YouTube.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.895
ROGER PALA: No, it was not
possible to get the data live.

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:56.340
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.680
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.230
PAUL KINLAN: And I suppose the
interesting thing is--

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.158
actually, that is a really good
point-- is because that's

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:04.170
the benefit of the HTML video
stream is that you can,

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.730
literally, just put it into a
texture and map it, put it

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.580
through WebGL, which we--

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:08.750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.330
ROGER PALA: The performance
is much better.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.555
If we were using Flash, we had
to send this data from Flash

00:09:14.555 --> 00:09:18.310
to JavaScript, which was slowing
down a lot of the

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.770
whole process.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.463
PAUL KINLAN: Wasn't there a very
early prototype where it

00:09:20.463 --> 00:09:21.340
was a Flash-based?

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.255
ROGER PALA: Yeah, at the
beginning we were using Flash

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:26.640
and sending the image
data to the canvas.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.470
PAUL KINLAN: I'm really glad
that you guys got this to

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.390
work, actually, because
it is beautiful.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.430
The thing I like about this
project is you don't know

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.030
about any of the technology it
uses behind the scenes, right?

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.220
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Right.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.240
PAUL KINLAN: You don't know it's
using WebGL, and SVG, and

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.455
Canvas, and all that type
of stuff to get this.

00:09:39.455 --> 00:09:40.940
It just looks pretty cool.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.730
I actually remember my son got
a picture of a shark swimming

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.963
past the front.

00:09:45.963 --> 00:09:46.380
He thought it was brilliant.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.800
He thought it was amazing.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.160
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we have
seen people in the Miniatur

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.080
Wunderland getting engineers
coming up repairing stuff.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.550
PAUL KINLAN: Really?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.853
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Kind of
reaching for the camera.

00:09:55.853 --> 00:09:56.895
[LAUGHING]

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:59.590
PAUL KINLAN: Oh man,
that's pretty cool.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:02.880
These are really cool,
these ones.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.012
So just to jump onto this--

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:09.700
well, we have no screen,
so let me refresh.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.270
Oh, it was loading.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:10.610
ROGER PALA: Yeah.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.790
PAUL KINLAN: Did you see that?

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:11.060
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.685
PAUL KINLAN: It did say it was
loading just as I refreshed.

00:10:14.685 --> 00:10:17.250
I love these things.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.090
Actually, so we're gonna talk
about the Universal

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.480
Orchestra later on.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.720
I love some of the animations
that you did in that one.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.740
So if you get a chance to watch
the Universal Orchestra

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.770
Hangout, I would because
it's got some really

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.020
cool stuff in there.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.304
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And we seem
to have lost the internet.

00:10:35.304 --> 00:10:36.210
PAUL KINLAN: No we haven't.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.960
See, it's when you say we have
lost it, we get it back.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.860
So this is a really
cool thing.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.570
So I mean, you mentioned
something about canvas--

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.800
normal 2D canvas.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:49.050
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yes, so here
we have both the WebGL showing

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.940
the donut and which is actually
just one shader that

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.740
then transforms it into the
spherical view of it as well.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.080
So that's one shader, and then
around it we have a 2D canvas

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.060
that shows the clock.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.640
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so this clock
over on the outside here--

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.090
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.540
ROGER PALA: It is the timer.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.190
PAUL KINLAN: This
is the timer.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.080
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.300
PAUL KINLAN: It's a pretty
nice layout.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.790
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And when you
roll over it, it's JavaScript

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:20.200
moving divs and stuff to
get that animation.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.786
PAUL KINLAN: That's really
cool, isn't it?

00:11:21.786 --> 00:11:25.470
You know, I still-- and I
said this earlier on--

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.270
I never saw the photos just
drop off last time.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.110
Is that a relatively new thing,
or has that been there?

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.490
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: It's
been there-- been

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.100
there from the start.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:33.290
PAUL KINLAN: Seriously?

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.670
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.960
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.590
Can I click on them?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:37.440
ROGER PALA: No.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.130
PAUL KINLAN: Feature request.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.360
[LAUGHING]

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.810
PAUL KINLAN: So that's
pretty cool, man.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.280
Of course the live stream.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.520
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: And this is
from the museum, which is

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.510
closed at the moment.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.730
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.460
We probably have to get special
dispensation to get

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.830
people through this.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.490
But this is at the
museum, right?

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.410
So these are the-- like you
can see on the right-- the

00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:59.530
orange Teleporter and
the blue one there.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.520
It's exactly the same type of
experience, right, where you

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.970
can take a photo, save it to
your laptop, and then get it

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:05.260
back later.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:05.695
MATTIAS EKENDAHL: Yeah.

00:12:05.695 --> 00:12:06.130
ROGER PALA: Yep.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.580
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty nice.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.620
Yeah, so that was a nice little
deep dive into some of

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.020
the bits behind the Teleporter
project.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.980
It's one of my favorite ones.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.660
It's probably one of the most
interactive ones there, like

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.590
the physically interactive ones
at the museum itself.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.350
If you get a chance, go and
check it out in the museum.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.610
If not, check it out online.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.460
It's just as good of a--

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:27.730
I can't speak.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.472
It's an awesome experience.

00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:30.722
Cool, thank you.
