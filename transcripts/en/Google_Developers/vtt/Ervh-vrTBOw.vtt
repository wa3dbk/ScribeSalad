BILL LUAN: Shanghai GDG a very

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.200
interesting developer community.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:04.960
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.320
has asked this question.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.415
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.730
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.440
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.700
would like to ask questions.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.440
IDO GREEN: Today in this GDL
episode, we speak a little bit

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.810
about the new Chromebook.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.180
And then I would love to dive
more into new things that any

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.980
web developer should know about
Chrome Dev Tools and how

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.020
they could leverage them and be
more productive when they

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130
are building their next web
app or mobile web app.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.945
So without further ado, let's
start and try to go--

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:48.530
I have this short list of things
that we could go and

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.780
work on it together.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.650
And here are the main ones.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.620
Of course, as you can see,
it's a blog post that I'm

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.270
going to publish later today.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150
But for now, let's just
go and dive into it.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.880
So the first thing that we have
today in Chrome-- and

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.330
basically, before we even start,
I would love to offer

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.590
web developers the opportunity
to install Chrome Canary

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.510
alongside their regular,
stable Chrome.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
You could go and just Google
Chrome Canary, install it.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.620
And when you're working on
your development, I would

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.590
extremely encourage
you to use it.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.980
It will give you great
capabilities in terms of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.620
having the greatest and latest
features in the Dev Tools.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.320
And moreover, you could see how
Chrome is going to look

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.130
like in the next
6 or 12 weeks.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.510
So the first thing that
we have today--

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.110
let's open Chrome
Dev Tools here--

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.720
is the opportunity to have
a device emulation.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.670
So it's true that in the past
we had this opportunity with

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.140
other simulators that we
needed to install.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.990
For instance, the iPhone
simulator on Mac or on any

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.400
iOS, and then for Android with
the simulators that work on

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.385
Windows, Mac, and
others platform.

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:00.330
But here, you have it
inside the browser.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.680
So how you do that
is you saw--

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.930
or you didn't, but I'll
make it a bit bigger

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.610
so it will be easier.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.860
I opened the Chrome Dev Tools.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.930
Let me do this a big
bigger as well.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.440
OK, so I'm going here to this
button, clicking on it.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.980
And now when I have the Setting
opportunity, what I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.100
can do here is basically
override the functionalities.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.480
The main functionality
that I could

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.550
override is the user agent.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.140
And that just allows me pretty
easily to mimic any mobile

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.250
device that I wish to do
or different browser.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.650
It's very, very convenient and
efficient to see how your site

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.650
or web app will look on, let's
say, Android 2.3 or

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.200
BlackBerry, and so on.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.330
So that's the first thing.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.510
The other thing that is very
cool is the device metric.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.910
You could now basically enter
any device metric that you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.920
want to check.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.490
But even more cool than that--
and you saw here, of course,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.790
that it's just changing.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.800
If you're overriding the
user agent, it will

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.330
automatically fit it.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.320
So if I'm working now on iPhone
5, you could see that

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.995
it filled for me the
device metric.

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:15.480
And that's a great thing because
it's just letting you

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.850
work with the exact device
that you wish and get the

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.810
exact screen resolution
that you have there.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.050
So that's one very cool feature
that we have today.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.600
And basically, there's
a ton of other

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.530
features in the settings.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.860
So if you want to drill down it
and see exactly what you're

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.590
getting there, this
in the new view.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.490
Another very important thing
is to emulate Touch Event.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.120
So if I'm clicking this
checkbox, from now on, I'll

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.160
get Touch Event.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.080
And specifically for mobile
applications, this is very,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.760
very crucial.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.700
So we don't need to use what
we used in the past, like

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.890
listening to an extra event and
then have the ability to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.180
have Click Event and
Touch Event.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.770
Here what we're doing is
pretty straightforward.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.480
We're just emulating
Touch Event.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.940
And from now on, our regular
Chrome in our desktop

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.320
environment will act and will
fire those touch events.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.310
So that's another pretty
cool new add-in.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.980
Other things that we have in
Chrome Dev Tools are actually

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.540
under the Experiments.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.650
And the experiments flag could
be triggered on by just going

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.400
to Chrome Flags.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.520
Let me open it and just
show it to you.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.350
So here, basically, you're
seeing all the different

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.210
experiments that you could
do today under Chrome.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.680
The list is very long,
as you can see.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.820
And what I really like in it is
that if you search just for

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.620
Dev Tools--

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.050
tools, yeah--

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.030
so enable Developer Tools
Experiments--

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.550
and in my case, it's
already enabled--

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.420
you could see things--

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.670
sorry, it's not enabled.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.280
Let me enable it.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.080
Or even better, yeah.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.460
Let me enable it here.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.550
OK.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.740
And now if I go here
and reload it--

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.110
Yeah, basically I need
to restart Chrome.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.150
Let me just get Chrome
restarted, the Chrome that I'm

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.090
using, and I'll open it again.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.080
And then you'll be able to see
what did the flag that I

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.280
opened in the experiment.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.945
Basically, we get another
tab under the Dev Tools.

00:05:37.945 --> 00:05:40.280
And this tab will be all the new
experiments that you could

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.560
do, all the different features
that you want

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.770
to use will be there.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.060
So let me just show
this to you.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.780
Yeah, this is the wrong
program now.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.150
And here we go.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.700
OK.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.066
Let's take this one.

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:09.078
And I'm opening it.

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:15.550
Yeah, so let's do another
new screen share.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.760
And yes.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.330
So now, basically what
you can see here--

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.970
and let me try just to
make it even larger.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.150
OK, so you see here, I how
have a new tab called

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.430
Experiment.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.000
And these experiments could give
you the new things that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.290
are going to be baked in Chrome,
hopefully in that

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.060
feature, and in that form and
shape, maybe a bit differently

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.690
in the future.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.010
But at least you could play
with them now and see

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.880
how they look like.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.000
Show CPU activity and timelines,
or override the

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.415
device geolocation, orientation,
support SASS,

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:55.056
lots of very, very
cool things.

00:06:55.056 --> 00:06:57.760
The Snippets support is one of
the things that I really like.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.690
And you could actually drive
into JSON objects and see them

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.820
in a very nice format in
the console today.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.730
So that's something that
we should open.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.645
And another very important thing
that I see more and more

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:14.280
web developers are using these
days is the ability

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.650
to disable the cache.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.890
So if you are working now, you
definitely don't want to be

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.630
miserable and try to figure
out if it's a

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.090
cache resource or not.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.940
Probably at the beginning
of your development, the

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.440
prototyping, you want just to
make sure that the cache is

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.510
disabled, and each and every
time that you're hitting the

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.770
server, you're getting
the latest version.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:39.210
Just check this option,
and you are a good.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.000
Other cool things that
you could do here is

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.640
enable source map.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.660
Source map is the option
to work with the

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.260
original form of the file.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.700
So let's say that you have
in your build system a

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.080
notification for
your JavaScript

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.050
or some other phase.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.210
Let's say, if you're working
with Dart and you have it

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.370
compiled to JavaScript,
basically with source map, you

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.890
could debug with the
original code base.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.840
And that's, of course, extremely
useful, specifically

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.120
when you're working in those
cases that you don't want to

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.530
work with a code that's
been magnified.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.950
You just want to work with
the source of it.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.480
What other cool things
that I worked?

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.520
The ability to log
XHR is very nice.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.040
And just to see the shadow dome
in places that you're

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.790
working with them is also
a very nice thing.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:37.510
In terms of rendering, to show
the repaint rectangulars, it's

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.520
very nice just to have this
organization what's going on

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.050
with your site in terms
of rendering.

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.390
That's basically most of the
things that I wanted to dig

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.010
from Dev Tools inside
the settings.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.900
Another other great capability
that had been covered in last

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.730
Google I/O was the ability how
to debug mobile websites.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.160
Let me just show you where
you could find it.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.540
So, yeah.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.000
Let's close this one.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.870
In the blog post that I'm going
to launch very soon, you

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.800
have here, basically, a great
talk by Pavel and Sam about

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.500
Dev Tools and how they allow you
to debug and be efficient

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.855
when you're working on
your mobile web apps.

00:09:30.855 --> 00:09:35.790
That's something that I highly
encourage you to check out

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:40.210
I think we are in a quite
good timing so far.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.016
I really apologize for
the people that were

00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:44.720
here exactly at 2:00.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.840
I had a bit of problems with
installing the new plug-in.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.170
And that's why I couldn't
do it on air on time.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.730
But I promise that the next
episode up here will be at

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.790
exactly 2:00 and not
2-0-something.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.950
So until next time, thank
you very much.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.680
And as always, if you have any
questions or feedback, just

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.765
feel free to reach
out to me on G+.

00:10:10.765 --> 00:10:13.010
Just google greenido.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.590
Or if you want, on Twitter,
greenido is one word as well.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.260
And if you have a cool start-up
that you want to show

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.190
cast in this episode, just feel
free to reach out to me.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:30.350
I'll share show notes for these
episodes on my blog.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.550
And I'll put a link there
for people that want

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.710
to be on the show.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.780
Just fill a short form, and
then we'll contact you.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.660
We have quite a lot of very
interesting episodes that

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.850
we're going to run in
the next few weeks.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.730
Some of them will be based on
great people that I met

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.125
yesterday in DLD Tel Aviv.

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:55.070
It's a big, big Yossi Vardi
festival and lots of great

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.620
VCs, NGOs, and developers
were there.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.930
We had two amazing events--

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.360
Google for Women
Entrepreneurship 2.0, and the

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.110
other was what Android can do.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.870
And for people in Israel that
are not part of the GDG, I

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.900
highly encourage you
to check it out.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.560
They are almost biweekly
or monthly meetings.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.650
And in most of them, you have
great speakers, great content.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.750
And you're just meeting very
cool people that are all

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.570
passionate about Android,
Chrome, HTML5, and what's cool

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.030
on the web with or without
Google platforms.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.720
So just feel free to
hang out with us.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.600
And thank you very much.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.850
Bye-bye.
