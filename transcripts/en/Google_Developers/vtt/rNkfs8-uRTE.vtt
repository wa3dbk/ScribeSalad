Hi, my name is Antony and I'm an engineer
working on Google Chrome extensions.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.220
I'm going to talk to you about a few topics
related to the ids, packaging and distribution

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.599
of extensions in our system.
If you choose to use the extensions gallery

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.470
to host and update your extensions, we take
care of many of these details for you.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.069
If you plan to do the hosting and updates
yourself - or if you are just curious - it

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:34.440
can be helpful to learn more about these concepts.
If you've tried making a test extension, you've

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.829
probably noticed that extensions have a strange
looking id made up of 32 characters.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.160
When we designed the system we wanted to have
a single globally unique identifier for each

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.989
extension so that there are no conflicts with
other extensions.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.940
What we did NOT want was to require any central
authority to assign these unique ids.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.149
The mechanism we settled on uses one public/private
key pair per extension, with the hash of the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.350
public key determining the extension's id.
Because of the way public keys are randomly

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.649
generated, the chance of a collision is extremely
small.

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.110
If you host your extension on the gallery,
we create and store the private keys for you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.930
and when you want to release a new version
of your extension all you need to do is log

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.130
in, upload the new source files, and hit the
publish button.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.259
Now I'll explore how the packaging and signature
process works. Google Chrome extensions are

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.040
packaged into "crx" files.
If you are using the gallery, we generate

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.659
the crx file for you when you hit the publish
button.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.869
If you want to host your extension on your
own site, you'll create the crx file with

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.281
the "Pack Extension" button on the extensions
management page in Google Chrome.

00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:55.930
A crx file is really just a zip file of your
extension directory plus 2 more things: the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.530
public key, and a signature of the zip contents
made using the private key.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.170
When installing a crx, Google Chrome extracts
the public key, signature and zipped content,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.140
and makes sure the signature is valid using
the public key.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.440
What this means is that once users have installed
a particular extension, they can get updates

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.810
to it and be sure that the new versions were
signed by the same private key as the original

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.080
version.
As with other types of software, developers

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.470
often want to update extensions to fix security
problems, bugs, and make general improvements.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.420
Google Chrome has a philosophy that client
software should be a lot like web apps, where

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.310
you always use the latest version and don't
have to do any work to get updates.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.260
In the design of our extensions system we're
following the same idea; so, we made auto-update

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.440
available to all extensions whether they are
hosted in the gallery or not.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.920
The way auto-update works is pretty simple
 - an extension specifies an autoupdate url

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.590
in its manifest, and the browser will check
that url every few hours for an xml file which

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
lists the most recent version of the extension
and where to download it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.090
The browser can fetch updated crx files over
a plain, non-ssl connection because it will

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.750
check the signature inside the crx file before
installing it.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620
If you're hosting your extension in our gallery,
you don't need to worry about autoupdate,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.400
we take care of it for you.
If you're hosting your extensions yourself,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.230
you just need to include an autoupdate url
in your extension's manifest.json file.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.310
I wanted to close this video by emphasizing
a few important points for developers:

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.650
First, a crx file is really just a zip file
with a little extra data tacked on.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.630
Second, each extension has a public/private
key pair, so if you develop 3 different extensions

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.320
you'll have 3 separate key pairs.
And finally, protecting the private key is

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.510
very important if you are self hosting your
extensions.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.950
