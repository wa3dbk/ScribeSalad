00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.150
MALE SPEAKER 1: Shanghai GDG
is a very interesting

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.110
developer community.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.950
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.230
has asked this question.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.370
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.680
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:This is
primarily a question and

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.510
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.760
would like to ask questions.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.020
ILYA GRIGORIK: Hello everyone,
and welcome to our Make The

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.720
Web Fast series here at Google
Developers Live.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.980
Today, we'll be talking about
the HTTP Archive data formats.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.540
And boy, do we have a loaded
episode of tools, tips, and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.800
tricks for you.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.720
But before we get to that,
my name is Ilya Grigorik.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.280
I'm a developer advocate for
the Make The Web Fast team

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.520
here at Google.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.160
PETER LUBBERS: I'm
Peter Lubbers.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.760
I'm a programs manager in the
Chrome Developer relations

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.022
team, and really excited about
a lot of the tools that--

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:56.460
or the ability that Chrome has
to track a lot of these things

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.290
to make the web faster.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.690
Today we're going to
talk about this

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.270
HTTP Archive format.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.480
There's a lot of cool features
in here, probably a lot of

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.260
things that you may not
even have thought of.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.920
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.590
So actually, Peter, yesterday we
got together to do a quick

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.020
run-through through all the
different demos that we want

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.440
to go through.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.090
And it took us what?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.350
An hour and a half or an
hour and 40 minutes?

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.290
PETER LUBBERS: And
we discovered

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.970
even some new stuff.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.220
ILYA GRIGORIK: So tons
and tons of stuff.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.470
Just a little bit of logistics
up front, we're going to do a

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.190
lot of demos.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.420
So don't worry about trying to
capture links or figure out

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.250
which specific tool we're
talking about.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.510
We'll actually share a URL at
the end where you can find all

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.530
of the resources.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.900
So just kind of sit back and
watch and hopefully learn a

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.520
few new things.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.650
Because we certainly learned a
lot of new tools just through

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.240
researching.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.290
And I think the reason for
this is one of the most

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.980
important things, in my
opinion at least, for

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.150
performance optimization,
working on performance in

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
general, is having good
instrumentation.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.360
So a few weeks back, we were
actually talking with Justin

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.460
Cutroni from the Google
Analytics team about how you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.790
can use navigation timing to
capture performance data out

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.240
of the browser for things like
network timing, JavaScript,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.430
web browser performance,
and all the rest.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.960
And today I think we're going
to go a little bit deeper.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.250
We are going to look at a tool
that a lot of us use, and we

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.450
don't necessarily think about
how the data underneath is

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.680
structured and how we can reuse
it in different ways.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.940
And the tool I'm talking
about is packet

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.720
sniffers or HTTP monitors.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720
Now, you guys probably don't
think about it that way

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.270
because most of us are used to
actually thinking about it as

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.400
Chrome Developer Tools has a
built-in tool which is a

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.905
network panel, which is actually
a packet sniffer, or

00:02:38.905 --> 00:02:41.150
an HTTP monitor.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.450
So I'm going to share my screen
here for you guys.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.290
So I'm looking at the
Google Developers

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.010
Live page right here.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.300
And I'm going to open the Chrome
Developer tools and

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.640
just reload this page.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.270
So I have the network
tab open.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.750
And if the demo gods are with
us, the page will reload.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.715
There it goes.

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:01.940
PETER LUBBERS: We're going
to need their help today.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.760
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes, exactly.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.350
So speaking of making the web
fast, this page is taking a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.190
long, long time to load.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.110
Here we go.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.690
So now we have this network
graph in here.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.650
And this is an invaluable tool
for debugging what's happening

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.120
with the site.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.270
So we can actually see that
it took a half a second to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.930
connect to this page and
all kinds of other

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.430
data within this tool.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.230
So we can click on
each resource.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.220
Now, this is very,
very useful.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.160
But what if you could actually
export this data?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.840
Or maybe to put it another way,
what if we could actually

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.130
take this data out of this tool
and maybe import it into

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.090
another tool?

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.670
You can do a lot of interesting
things with that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.970
type of data.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.390
PETER LUBBERS: Up until now, the
only way to really do that

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.200
was to take a screenshot.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.440
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right, yeah.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.790
PETER LUBBERS: Maybe annotate
the screenshot, put a few

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.500
arrows, like look at this one or
look at the timing on this.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.120
That's obviously not
a great way.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.950
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I've
done exactly

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.790
this, and this is terrible.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.610
I would find a problem.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.410
I'm like, oh, I need to email
Peter about this.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.410
So I take a screenshot, annotate
it with like, OK,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.460
here's our problem.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.320
And then I send it over, and
then I get a question back

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.070
like, OK, that's cool, but
what was the status code?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.940
Or what were the headers?

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.590
And I'm like, well--

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.140
PETER LUBBERS: Lost it.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.820
ILYA GRIGORIK: Grrrr.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.710
We lost all the data because we
froze it in the screenshot.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.110
So it would be really nice if we
could actually export this

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.279
data with all of its fidelity,
all of the data that's

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.754
actually hidden within here,
and then reuse it in a

00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:23.640
different way.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.800
So that's precisely what
the HTTP Archive

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.320
data format is for.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.850
So I'm going to show
you guys this.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.790
We're not going to go into
details of the spec, but there

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:32.640
is a spec for it.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.130
So the HTTP Archive, the
extension is HAR, so hence,

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.460
the HAR show.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.860
Ha, ha.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.440
And the HAR data format itself
is just a simple JSON schema,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.510
which contains all the metadata
that you would need

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.810
to reconstruct the network
waterfall.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.870
So you can think of it as just
an underlying data of the

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.000
network pane in your Chrome
Developer Tools or another

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.570
HTTP monitoring tool.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.200
So you can see that it contains
a lot of different

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.140
data, like which browser, which
pages you accessed.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.920
And entries are the individual
requests that the browser

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.810
makes for all of the resources
on a page.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.260
So I actually have
a live file here.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.010
So this is a long file.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.160
I'm not going to go
through in detail.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.560
But I just want to show you guys
how does this thing look.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.620
So what I was doing--

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.840
PETER LUBBERS: You're doing
JSON format, right?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.240
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.470
So it's very simple
to create and

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.510
consume, which is actually--

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.215
we'll see later-- is very,
very important.

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:26.240
So I'll just show you
guys what this data

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.440
actually looks like.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.650
So here I'm trying to access an
archives page, so I typed

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.650
in igvita.com/archives.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.390
So let me close that.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.740
Now we're looking
at the entries.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.980
So we see the first entry, which
is the actual request.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.300
We see that the browser is
sending a get request for this

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.680
actual page.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.330
And now, all of a sudden,
look at this.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.260
You have all the header
information.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.160
Every header that the browser
appends is here, even cookies.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.460
I probably don't want
to show you that.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.030
And then it has the response,
which is, OK, so

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.540
it's doing a redirect.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.920
And it will actually
kick me out.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.770
So let me close this.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.650
And we can look at
the next request.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.230
Here is the same page asking
for a Google web font.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.470
So all of this performance
timing data, all of the header

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.650
data is all captured here,
which is very, very

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.780
convenient.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.710
PETER LUBBERS: Tell the audience
a little bit more

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.565
about the httparchive.org site,
and then how that came

00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:24.030
about to really set
the context here.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.420
ILYA GRIGORIK: A good example of
how you could use this data

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.990
is actually httparchive.org.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.250
So the HTTP Archive format and
httparchive.org are actually

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.730
two separate things.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.280
They just happen to share the
same name, confusingly enough.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.040
But they actually have
a common history.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.530
The idea behind HTTP Archive,
you guys may be familiar with

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.480
the Internet Archive, which
continuously crawls the web

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.360
and takes snapshots
of certain pages.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.470
So actually, you can rewind
history, and you can say, I

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.290
want to see this page how
it looked back in 2008.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.420
So think of HTTP Archive as a
very similar tool, except that

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.130
we don't actually care for what
the pages looked like.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.340
We care about how
do they perform.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.000
So things like let's capture how
many JavaScript files were

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.540
on a page, what was the total
size of the page, how many

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.320
images did you fetch, all
of that metadata.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.150
And this is actually an
important point for the HTTP

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.380
Archive format.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.420
When you export it, by default,
it won't export the

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.920
body of the request.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.050
So if you fetch a 1-megabyte
image, we're not going to

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.600
include that.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.050
We just include the
actual metadata.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.090
Because that's all we need
for the waterfall.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.700
So what can you do this?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.020
Well, the idea behind HTTP
Archive is that we can crawl a

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.700
lot of sites.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.710
So HTTP Archive actually does
about 100,000 sites right now

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.300
based on the-- it elects the
top, I guess, 100,000.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.390
And it aggregates all of these
HTTP archives, so all of that

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.090
metadata for all the network
waterfalls, and then extracts

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.770
meta-trends for things like are
the pages growing in size,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.400
or what's happening.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.980
So let me show you this.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.230
We'll go to trends.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.700
And it'll take us
one second here.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.520
And you can see that we're
analyzing about 200,000 sites

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.690
now, so it's growing.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.260
And we can see total transfer
size and total request.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.510
So it's a little bit small.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.140
But an average page within those
200,000 sites today is

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.970
over 1 megabyte in size and
takes over 85 requests.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.910
That's shocking.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.120
I see this number all the time,
but it still shocks me

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.960
every time I see it.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.650
The HTML part itself takes
48 kilobytes, right?

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.820
So all of this metadata is just
aggregated between all

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.760
the different runs--

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.530
PETER LUBBERS: From HAR files.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.230
ILYA GRIGORIK: From HAR files.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.830
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.200
ILYA GRIGORIK: So this is a
really good example of we've

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.400
accumulated many
of these files.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.620
We have them over time.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.560
And now we're just collapsing
them together to

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.760
create these formats--

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.990
sorry, not formats, to create
these graphs to show you

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.790
general trends on the web.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.890
And you can definitely see that
the pages are growing in

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.540
size, more requests,
so on and so forth.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.140
PETER LUBBERS: Let me show you
something in the Chrome

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.330
Developer tools that
you can use.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.580
Maybe some people are not
aware of that yet.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.430
Let's open it up again and
then reload the page.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.480
PETER LUBBERS: Now we get a
network waterfall here.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.270
PETER LUBBERS: So once
you get that--

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.110
so now you can actually
just right click on

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.690
the left side there.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.930
ILYA GRIGORIK: Just
anywhere in here?

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.830
PETER LUBBERS: Just
anywhere, yeah.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.650
And notice the option here.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.380
We have actually two options.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.940
And you can also do this
in Firefox, I believe.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.570
Copy entry as HAR.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.790
You can click on an individual
file and save the HAR

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.230
information.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:39.865
ILYA GRIGORIK: So if I clicked
on style.css, it

00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:41.500
would just grab that?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.860
PETER LUBBERS: Just
the style.css.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.420
And of course, typically I
think you would be more

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.510
interested in the entire page
with all its resources.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.840
So, copy all as HAR would
copy the HAR JSON

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.910
directly to the clipboard.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.960
Now, if you want to save it as
a file, there is an option

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.520
there to save entry as HAR.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.800
And that just saves
it as a file.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.440
So yeah, let's go ahead and
do that at the moment.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.940
ILYA GRIGORIK: If I just copy
this and if I go into my text

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.550
editor and just create a
new file here, so it's

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.780
5,000 lines of JSON.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.790
And this is basically all the
metadata that's inside of this

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.750
network waterfall.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.810
PETER LUBBERS: So with that
data you could effectively

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:22.330
reconstruct the network panel.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.700
We'll have an example
of that later.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.400
But also you can pull out
specific bits and

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.590
pieces that you want.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.520
You want to see a specific--

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.470
the size of the request
or the headers.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.710
ILYA GRIGORIK: Actually, this
is worth pausing on.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.900
Because previously, I would
just take a snapshot or a

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.720
screenshot, annotate it,
and send it over.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.390
Now, I can right click on this,
copy, and maybe if I'm

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.220
making a bug report,
I can actually

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.860
attach the entire trace.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.410
And then the developer has full
metadata about everything

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.680
that's happened in
the browser.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.840
PETER LUBBERS: You could
still send me the

00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.550
screenshot as well.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.790
ILYA GRIGORIK: OK, sure.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.070
PETER LUBBERS: But we can
reconstruct the screenshot,

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.240
effectively, with that data.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.860
So that's cool.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.480
ILYA GRIGORIK: So that's
interesting.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.060
That actually brings
up a good point.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.330
So OK, great, we took this
very nice visual

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.560
representation.

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.030
I copied it into a 5,000 line
JSON file which is very

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.700
useful, but--

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.680
PETER LUBBERS: You've got
to deal with it now.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.140
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.170
If I get this 5,000 line
JSON file, boy.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.910
PETER LUBBERS: You're
going to need some

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.280
visualization of that data.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.860
And fortunately, there's
tons of tools that

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.790
can help with this.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.940
Let's take a look at one.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.030
Probably the best one for that
at the moment is the HAR

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.335
viewer that you've got here.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:43.930
It's an open source project.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:46.290
You can just open
it up on the--

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.900
ILYA GRIGORIK: So it
looks like actually

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.450
I can run it myself.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.010
So we can just embed
it on any page.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.950
So it's PHP and JavaScript,
which is really cool.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.710
But they also have an online
demo, so we're

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.420
going to try that.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.360
I actually have it
preopened here.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.600
So this is--

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.800
what do I do here?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.500
PETER LUBBERS: Basically,
remember how you copied the

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.740
HAR information stuff?

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.560
You could obviously--

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.710
actually, this supports
drag and drop as well.

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.170
You could take the HAR file and
drag it onto this page.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.805
But for now, you have it in
the clipboard already.

00:12:11.805 --> 00:12:13.700
So go ahead and paste
it in there.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.850
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I'm going to
paste the entire 5,000 lines

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.890
of JSON in here.

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.680
PETER LUBBERS: Keep your
fingers crossed.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.370
And there we go.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.780
ILYA GRIGORIK: Wow.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.210
Look at that.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.830
PETER LUBBERS: Pretty
informative as well.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: So that
took no time.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:26.370
And look at this.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.190
Now, I have--

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.340
actually no, this is a
little bit different.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.260
I think that's something
else on my clipboard.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.560
PETER LUBBERS: Well,
let's do it again.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.630
ILYA GRIGORIK: Well, it probably
doesn't even matter.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.980
PETER LUBBERS: So now
you get the whole

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.370
visualization of all that data.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.690
ILYA GRIGORIK: Now that I have
this JSON file, I can go to

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.240
this thing, paste it in, and
basically reconstruct exactly

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.320
what happened in your browser.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.630
And the nice thing is, I still
have all the fidelity of all

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.090
of the header information,
requests, the

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:59.320
actual timing data.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.240
That actually gives you a little
bit more than Chrome

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.960
Developer Tools, things like
these pie charts, where was

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.630
the time spent.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.460
You can see that within this
session, we fetched--

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.690
out of all the content that was
fetched, more than half

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.490
was images, which is actually
pretty typical.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.080
So this is really nice.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.760
PETER LUBBERS: Then you can
compare it with other loads of

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:23.950
your page or other sites and
see the trends over time.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.700
So actually, one thing I wanted
point out, if you can

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.520
just jump back a moment to the
Chrome Developer Tools, one

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.980
really cool thing that
I particularly like--

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.340
if you, for example,
refresh this page.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.420
And let's go ahead and
do that a moment.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.790
So refresh the page.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:47.600
And you notice how in the
network panel it will reload

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.850
everything.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.370
Right now, it sort of wiped
out all of the previous

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.200
information, and it's got the
new-- and that's typically

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.580
what you want.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.570
But now if you want to
actually track--

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.020
navigating from page to page
to page, you can hit the

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.760
Record button on the bottom.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.200
ILYA GRIGORIK: I've often
wondered what

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.100
that thing was for.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.740
PETER LUBBERS: So click that.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.350
And then why don't you go to
the trends page or stats.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.070
ILYA GRIGORIK: I think I'm
on the trends now,

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.180
so I'll go to Stats.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.490
PETER LUBBERS: Click on Stats.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.480
And now let's click
on websites.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.260
ILYA GRIGORIK: Sure.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.610
PETER LUBBERS: And why don't we
just go finish it off with

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.540
the About page.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.390
So basically what's happening
is the information is not

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.030
thrown away.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.190
It's just added on.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.250
ILYA GRIGORIK: Let me stop the
recording here for a second.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.870
And now look at this timeline.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.050
It actually says 50 seconds.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.180
It's not that any one of those
pages took 50 seconds.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.840
It's just that the timeline
is appended across all the

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.510
different sessions.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.350
PETER LUBBERS: It's a complete
trace of what you're renewing.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.940
ILYA GRIGORIK: That's
really cool.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.440
So now I can actually do a thing
like come to the Home

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.700
page, press Record, go to Login
page, go to the Checkout

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.330
cart, and record that
entire trace.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.770
PETER LUBBERS: So now actually,
you can go ahead and

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:01.370
do it in a moment.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.720
There's an interesting
thing at the viewer.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.430
ILYA GRIGORIK: OK, so
let me copy this.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.580
So this is probably like
50,000 lines of JSON.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.610
And go to the--

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.720
so let me hit Back.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.000
PETER LUBBERS: Back
to the Home page.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.540
ILYA GRIGORIK: Here's
our online demo.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.120
HAR Viewer online.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.360
Close some of these tabs.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.670
PETER LUBBERS: So we're going
to put it in there.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.380
And the nice thing is, if we hit
the Preview there, you'll

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.940
see actually four pages.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.690
And you can actually in the top
part, even if just hover

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.100
over them, you see a lot
of detail already.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.300
ILYA GRIGORIK: So then within
the session, we just recorded

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.030
four different pages.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.650
And then for each page, we can
look at these pie charts.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:48.370
And we also have the full
waterfall chart for each one.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.100
And this is just spread over
the entire session.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.930
PETER LUBBERS: That's
pretty awesome.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.915
Also, what I like about it is,
you can actually have a site

00:15:55.915 --> 00:15:58.070
that has multiple pages.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.030
You can really see
the outliers.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.430
You can say, oh, all of them are
about the same, but this

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.200
one is way out there.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.440
What's happening to that?

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.580
You can zoom in, and you
have some context.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.620
ILYA GRIGORIK: So
you know what?

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.240
Now that I see this, what I want
this a record button in

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.470
Chrome, where I can actually
tell my users to just say, oh,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.400
you're having a problem?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.050
Hit Record.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.050
Go through a couple pages.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.300
Now stop and sent
me that trace.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.875
That would be really cool.

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:24.780
PETER LUBBERS: That
would be cool.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.460
ILYA GRIGORIK: There's an
extension in the making right

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.790
after this show.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.040
OK, that's really cool.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.920
So what's next on our agenda?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.950
PETER LUBBERS: We talked
about the viewer.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.970
Let's talk about some
other tools.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:43.840
And one of the nice things--
it's not an actual official

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.200
standard or specification.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.360
I mean, there is a spec.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.130
But it's sort of the de-facto
standard, if you will, for a

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.010
lot of this information.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.780
Not just Chrome, but Firefox
supports it.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.330
But there's a lot
of other tools.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.730
And so maybe you could just go
to the HAR adopter's page.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.450
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right, the "har"
HAR adopter's page.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.490
So it turns out Chrome supports
HAR, as we just saw.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:12.910
But it turns out that most other
tools that you guys are

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.079
familiar with also have
a HAR export.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:18.540
In fact, the whole point for
creating the standard was

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.839
originally when Firebug and
NetExport or HttpWatch were

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.310
trying to figure out, how do
we come up with a single

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.589
standard so we don't
end up creating

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.960
different export files?

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.250
So this is probably three
or four years back.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.050
So, obviously, Firebug and
HttpWatch support this.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.320
But if you look through this,
IE, Chrome Developer Tools, we

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.180
just saw HAR Viewer, and there's
probably three dozen

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.360
different tools in here.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.940
And so Charles Proxy is another
very popular tool.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.100
So this is actually an
important point.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.410
This is not just in a browser.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.720
So if I have a proxy running and
I configure my browser to

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.830
go through it, I can still
capture all the same data,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:56.530
which is really nice.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.540
PETER LUBBERS: This will come
in very handy, for example,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.250
with mobile browsers.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.180
ILYA GRIGORIK: And we'll
actually see

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.440
an example of that.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.150
And then I guess the other thing
to mention is the format

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.270
itself is very flexible,
JSON, which is nice.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.480
Because most every language
out there today has a very

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.430
good JSON library, because it
just maps very easily to your

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.750
basic data types.

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.070
But if you want, there are
wrappers in each language.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.440
So things like the Java HarLib,
where you just give it

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.980
the HAR file, and it gives you
a nice object back which you

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.140
can iterate over.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.910
There's Perl.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:31.540
There's Ruby.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.160
I found a whole bunch
of different tools.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.530
PETER LUBBERS: It's pretty
amazing the amount

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.600
of support for this.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.120
Actually, just over the weekend,
we got a mail from

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.340
Eric Duran from New York who
built this great little

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.960
viewer, which I thought it was
awesome, because this is

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.740
actually just a--

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.930
ILYA GRIGORIK: This looks
very familiar.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.570
This looks like Chrome
Developer Tools.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.160
PETER LUBBERS: It really does.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.170
He sort of re-implemented
all of that with

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.600
drag-and-drop support.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.470
ILYA GRIGORIK: So this
is a page, right?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.710
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.860
ILYA GRIGORIK: We're looking
at. github.com/chromeHAR.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.960
So drag and drop a HAR file.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.880
OK, so I happen to
have a HAR file.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.130
I've come prepared.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.730
PETER LUBBERS: Isn't
that awesome?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.790
ILYA GRIGORIK: Look at that.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.660
It's the same tools that
we know and love.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.630
I can click on this.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.330
You can see all the headers, the
cookies, the timing, and

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.490
this is just a web app.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:22.180
So it's really cool.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.670
I think this is actually a good
demo of something that

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.140
not many people realize, which
is Chrome Developer

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.260
Tools is a web app.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.630
So I think what Eric is doing
here is he's actually pulling

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.570
out a lot of the styling
and perhaps even

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.490
the JavaScript logic.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.480
PETER LUBBERS: I think so.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.090
I haven't completely had enough
time to look at it yet,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.120
but it's pretty.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.880
ILYA GRIGORIK: That's
a pretty cool demo.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.250
So if you guys want, there's
a HAR Viewer.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.030
Now there's this.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:51.370
And it looks like he's even
thinking about adding some PHP

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.040
functionality.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.530
PETER LUBBERS: We'll come back
to that one as well.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:55.330
ILYA GRIGORIK: Unfortunately,
I can't click on

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:56.630
it right now, but--

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.430
PETER LUBBERS: So one of the
things about all of this is,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.430
of course, getting kind of
already a little bit tired of

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.010
the manual parts of this.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:05.100
Let's focus on that a bit.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.590
Because if you have to actually
download this HAR

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.910
file that's great.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.090
But if you have to do this more
often, like, for example,

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.240
if you want to start seeing
trends over time, then it's

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.800
going to be a little
bit problematic.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.120
You're going to see--

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.010
you're constantly doing
this manual work.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:28.380
So what tools are there, Ilya,
for automating this process?

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.200
ILYA GRIGORIK: Well, short of
getting an army of monkeys,

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.310
the other way to do it is--

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.300
so actually, there's a lot
of different ways.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.630
And I'm actually really excited
about this stuff.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.430
Let me show you some examples.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.670
So first of all, I don't
know if you guys are

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.660
familiar with PhantomJS.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.880
PETER LUBBERS: That's
the headless router?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.030
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.740
It's a headless WebKit
browser.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.180
And the cool thing about it--
well, there's so many cool

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:54.860
things about it.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.090
We could probably do an
entire show on it.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.240
But one of things I like about
it is it's very easy to

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.080
download and install.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.000
It's a statically compiled
binary, so you just download

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.900
this zip file.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.450
You unpack it, and it's
basically a browser, a

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.700
full-featured WebKit browser,
which means it can execute

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.730
JavaScript.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.310
It'll download your CSS images,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.010
everything, which is nice.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.440
And you can run it from
the command line.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.850
So this is what I have here.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.510
I just downloaded
the actual file.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.250
I unpacked it.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.220
I just have it sitting here.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:27.790
Now I can do "bin phantom,"
and if you look at this--

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:30.480
so it just gives you a little
bit of help information.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.550
You can configure it
any way you like.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.640
But the way it basically works
is you need to give Phantom a

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.870
script to tell it what to do.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.130
So think of it as this is a
browser, and we need to tell

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.040
it, hey, I want you to open
a file or a URL and

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.970
do something there.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.080
So It comes with a couple of
different example scripts, one

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.510
of which is NetSniff.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.620
I think you can guess what
it's going to do.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:57.060
It's going to sniff on
the network traffic

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.880
and log that data.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.900
Let me do this.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.630
I'll actually download
a page here.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.720
And if all goes well, this
should run Phantom.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.780
And look, it spit out what
looks like a JSON file.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.940
In fact, it looks
like a HAR file.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.980
Surprise!

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:16.395
PETER LUBBERS: Very surprised.

00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:20.680
ILYA GRIGORIK: So let me
actually just to save that to

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.740
an out file instead of just
printing it to screen.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.100
So we're looking at this.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.650
Once again, we have
all the JSON data.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.500
So what just happened?

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.370
I think this is really
important.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.370
We have a fully-featured browser
that went in and

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.500
captured all the network data.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.780
Now imagine if you take--

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.830
PETER LUBBERS: But you run
it on the command line.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.930
So imagine now you take this,
and you have your CI build

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.880
running on your--

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.930
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.060
ILYA GRIGORIK: --instance.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.790
And after each check-in,
you run this and you

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:54.840
captured a HAR file.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.800
Now you have the
full timeline.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.410
On every check-in, you have
a history of what happens.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.330
Maybe you added more resources
and all the rest.

00:23:05.678 --> 00:23:07.740
PETER LUBBERS: That actually is
interesting, because if you

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:13.150
do that and you combine it
with running that through

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:17.649
analysis tools like PageSpeed,
YSlow, is

00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:19.030
that already supported?

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.010
ILYA GRIGORIK: You guys
can see that we

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:21.240
practiced this yesterday.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.520
So here's another tool
that you'll love.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.190
So if you guys use Node,
there's actually--

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.590
YSlow is available
as a Node module.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.560
You can just run it.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.970
I already have it installed
on my machine.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.450
But if you run NPM, install
YSlow, that's what you're

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.630
going to get.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.240
Let me just--

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.830
so once you install it, you just
get this YSlow binary.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.680
It gives you a couple different
examples here.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.360
I'm just going to copy
the guy right here.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.050
I think there's actually
a typo in the Readme.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.210
So we need two double dashes.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:54.900
And guess what it takes?

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.620
PETER LUBBERS: A HAR file.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.198
ILYA GRIGORIK: It takes
the HAR file.

00:23:57.198 --> 00:23:59.070
PETER LUBBERS: It's
getting old.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.530
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.510
So what we're going to
do is we're just

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.000
going to print out--

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.760
actually, let me change
this for one second.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.800
We're going to print out
a basic summary.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.840
And format plain is
just plain text.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.630
And feed it this HAR file.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.420
And it analyzes the HAR file,
and says OK, there's 80

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.220
kilobytes of data that
we downloaded here.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.080
The score according to all of
the YSlow rules is 100.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.940
Hooray.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.770
And there's a total of seven
requests for this.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.080
So that's kind of interesting.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.840
Now let's dig in a little
bit deeper.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.520
Let's run all.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.900
And if you run all, all
of a sudden, you

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.680
get a ton more output.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.670
So what happens here is, YSlow
has a set of rules or

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.590
categories of rules for things
like, are you using a CDN?

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.350
Are you setting expire
setters?

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.290
Are you compressing your data
on all these things?

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.500
As you can see, it's actually
scored that entire HAR file

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.700
with respect to all
those rules.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.810
And it's giving you
a specific score.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.570
So it just so happens
that this page is

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.190
actually fairly optimized.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.330
There's no offenders in the
sense that if there was a file

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:06.960
that wasn't compressed, it
would show up in here.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.450
So now we have two things.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:11.870
We've captured the HAR file
from command line.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:13.480
We ran it through YSlow.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.900
And, of course, you don't
actually have

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.260
to print this out--

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:16.750
PETER LUBBERS: All from
the command line.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:17.350
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.800
And you don't have to print
this out in plain text.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.230
To feed into your own tool,
you have JSON output.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:30.390
So now, literally in two lines
of batch script, you can get

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.990
access to all the performance
data.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:36.750
So now in every CI check-in,
I can run this and raise an

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.755
alarm if all of a sudden--

00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:39.010
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.960
You can set alarms for when you
drop a certain score, or

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.980
like, for example, images that
are not compressed or it

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:50.490
thinks that it picks up the
typical YSlow rules.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.350
And then that can trigger
a whole chain of alarms

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.130
and ways to fix it.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:56.610
That's awesome.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.140
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.160
PETER LUBBERS: So is that also
supported in PageSpeed?

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.790
ILYA GRIGORIK: It is.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:03.750
So it will require a little
bit more work.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.940
But if you go to the PageSpeed
site-- so I'm just looking at

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.090
the PageSpeed SDK.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.150
You can actually download
the entire SDK.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:10.810
It's an open source project.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.000
And if you build the SDK,
you'll actually get this

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.440
binary called--

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.010
guess what?

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.910
HAR to PageSpeed.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.490
And you feed it a HAR file, and
you get a similar output,

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.440
but perhaps slightly different
rules and slightly different

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.860
waitings as YSlow.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.510
If you're a PageSpeed fan,
you can also use this.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.030
And by the way, PageSpeed SDK
also comes with some really

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:34.950
awesome tools like the PageSpeed
Optimize Image.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.240
Nicely named, very
descriptive.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.150
So you just pass it an image
file, and it'll automatically

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.350
pick out the right format and
optimize the stuff for you.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.680
That's something you
can also do as part

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.930
of your build process.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.110
PETER LUBBERS: So I think when
I first started looking the

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.360
HAR format and everything, I
really thought of it primarily

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.960
from a browser perspective.

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.520
And actually, after looking at
this more, obviously it's the

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.560
browser making that HTTP request
to the server and the

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.970
server responding.

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.650
So when you start thinking about
it that way, it's like,

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.470
OK, we can actually do
a lot more with it.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:13.970
We can actually go beyond the
browser, if you will, and

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.530
start implementing HAR
on the server side.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.400
ILYA GRIGORIK: That's
a cool idea.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.950
PETER LUBBERS: I don't think
there's a whole lot of tools

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:22.870
around that yet.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.300
But it's the same format.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.410
ILYA GRIGORIK: So just to
elaborate this a little bit, a

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:30.020
lot of API servers or app
servers that you build kind of

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:30.920
follow the same pattern.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.470
A request comes in then you have
a dispatch to a database

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.860
or maybe another HTTP server
that does something.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.650
And it's the same waterfall,
basically.

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:41.480
PETER LUBBERS: But
on the inside.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.790
ILYA GRIGORIK: So it would be
kind of cool if we could

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.520
visualize the same data.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.720
And we saw a whole number of
different rules-- or tools,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.080
rather, that we can use for
this kind of stuff.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.710
PETER LUBBERS: So let's take a
look at a sample file that you

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:58.670
put together already for this,
just to get the idea of what's

00:27:58.670 --> 00:27:59.860
happening here.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:05.770
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I've created
this mock file, and how that's

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.250
created is a separate story.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.390
You can instrument your
own app server.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:12.790
Or you can actually use some
other tricks which we'll talk

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.410
about in a second.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:15.280
PETER LUBBERS: Some
sort of logging.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.220
ILYA GRIGORIK: Exactly.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.740
So actually, I'm going to
sneak in another demo.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:21.920
So if you guys are working with
HAR files, and you have

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.380
them on disk, there is this--

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.100
and you have Ruby installed,
which you probably do, you can

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.640
actually do "gem install har,"
which creates this very, very

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.390
handy utility.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.240
What you do is then you say
"har" and it installs this

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.280
kind of dense script, and
you pass it a file.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.070
And check this out.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:44.980
So I'm going to run this.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:51.400
And it starts a local server,
which embeds the HAR viewer

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.050
and fires up a new tab on your
thing and just visualizes it

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.610
right here.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:56.650
How awesome was that?

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:57.490
PETER LUBBERS: Wow.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: So we don't
even have to copy

00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.310
it, go to the site.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.400
You just kind of like feed it
a file and there you go.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.400
So next time somebody emails you
or you have a bug report

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.700
with a HAR file, download it,
run it with this, you're up

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.180
and running.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.670
So let's look at this.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.790
What's happening here?

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:17.070
This is a simple request where
we're kind of simulating in

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:22.010
let's say an RSS feed
application, where a request

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.090
comes in for this feed ABC.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.160
And the next thing that happens
is we dispatch a

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.510
search request for ABC, which
is basically like, what are

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.820
the articles that
I should show?

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.040
What are the article IDs?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.710
Let's say that returns a couple
different IDs, three.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:40.020
So that request takes some time,
136 milliseconds, and we

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.620
have all of the header
information on all the other

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.040
metadata from our API server.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.420
And then we, in parallel,
dispatch three requests to

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.902
fetch the articles, and then
the response is returned.

00:29:51.902 --> 00:29:54.440
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, you can
really trace right into that

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.300
and see where you're taking
most of the time.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.570
ILYA GRIGORIK: So now you can
think about instrumenting your

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.090
app server and reusing
the same tools.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.130
This is great visualization.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:07.740
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, by sticking
to the format, you

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.490
really get a lot of benefits.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:11.540
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah,
there's so many

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.670
different tools out there.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.560
And speaking of tools-- so now
let's take this use case.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.160
So we've captured a HAR
file, let's say,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.430
on the command line.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.650
We can run it through YSlow,
which is very good for

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.350
capturing, let's say,
regressions or anomalies if

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.400
somebody checks in,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.830
So it'll ingest this data.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.520
But now it gets smarter, which
is to say, it looks at the URL

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.400
which you were accessing, and it
says, hey, you've actually

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.170
uploaded not one, but three
traces of this file, spread

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:44.140
across time.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.600
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to visualize the

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.150
difference in page loading
time or total size.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.190
So we actually have--
as you can see here,

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.810
we have three runs.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.570
I was playing with this
on the weekend.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:59.830
And between these three
different runs-- so the yellow

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.470
line here is the
full load time.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.590
So the load time went up from
0.75 seconds to about 1 second

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.360
between the three runs.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.620
This graph is also very
interactive, which I didn't

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.890
realize for a while.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.870
For example, I can disable this
and load things like the

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.310
onLoad time and time
to first byte.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.780
Imagine having this data for
your site across two weeks,

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.180
and now you can go in and look
at, well, am I just putting

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.850
more images?

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.290
Or why did for my load
time get worse?

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.590
And then you can also---

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:35.020
if you need a nice artifact for
your next presentation,

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:39.010
you can also just save that
as a PNG image, or an SVG.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:39.570
So that's cool.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.260
That allows you to trend
it over time.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:47.260
And within here, for each
specific run, you, of course,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.410
still have access to all of the
metadata within each one.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.590
Domains from which we fetched
all the resources, it even

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.870
embeds PageSpeed scoring.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:58.860
So it says, well,
for this page--

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.820
let's see, cache validator.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.950
So some of the resources didn't
have a cache validator.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.990
So it gave me an 83.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:07.240
OK, interesting.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.190
The HAR Viewer, as you would
expect, embedded in here, and

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.870
you can toggle between all
the different runs.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.450
So here's a little tip.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.900
We've talked about those any
number of times now, but

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.540
you've captured on CLI.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.330
You run it through YSlow,
and then you can

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.620
push it into here.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.740
And all of a sudden, you have a

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.970
performance monitoring solution--

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:27.980
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.750
ILYA GRIGORIK: --in like three
lines of batch script.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.010
And if you guys are interested,
I actually found

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.980
this example on the
HAR storage Wiki.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.400
I uploaded the file manually,
but you can just--

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.710
here's four lines of
Python where you

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.580
just encode the data.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:45.600
You push it in.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.550
And that's it.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:47.800
You're done.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.300
PETER LUBBERS: We've looked
at it from the browser

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.090
perspective now.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:56.760
We've looked at it from the
server side in the automation.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:01.880
And one thing we talked about
briefly is the mobile support.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.170
Obviously, you don't always have
Chrome Developer Tools on

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.230
your mobile device.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.940
So how would you use some of
these tools to set that up?

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:11.630
ILYA GRIGORIK: So I
actually made--

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.940
I cheated.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:13.740
I made us a little

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.380
presentation there, two slides.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.830
You bring up a really good
point, which is if you're

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.060
using Chrome on Android, you
actually have remote

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.540
debugging, which is absolutely
awesome.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.320
Because you have access to the
same network panel plus all of

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:27.850
the other--

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:29.740
even JavaScript debugging.

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:34.020
But what happens when you're
running an older or another

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.120
browser which doesn't have
that capability?

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.970
PETER LUBBERS: And just for
those of you attending, we did

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.990
do a show on-- the Chrome Mobile
show just last week on

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.420
Chrome Mobile debugging.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.750
ILYA GRIGORIK: It's
an awesome tool.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.620
If you guys haven't used it
before, we definitely

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.530
recommend it.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.650
But here we're talking about a
slightly different use case,

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.520
which is let's say I have an
older phone or a phone with a

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.920
browser that doesn't support
this kind of thing.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.740
Could I still get access
to this data?

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.880
It's actually a little bit
tricky if you think about it.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.380
How do you do that?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.199
So there's a trick.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.049
I made a diagram just
to explain it.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.560
PETER LUBBERS: It involves
a proxy server.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.719
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes, it involves
a proxy server.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.489
So here's the trick.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:17.949
You have your phone.

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:19.719
And I will assume that
your phone can

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.150
connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.920
That's a requirement,
unfortunately.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.280
If you can't do that, then
you can't use this trick.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.699
But let's assume it does.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.690
So what we do is we take our
laptop, and we actually start

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:35.500
a Wi-Fi hotspot on it,
so it becomes--

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.350
starts to broadcast.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.389
We then connect our phone
to the laptop.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:43.750
And now if I'm browsing on my
phone, I'm actually going

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:45.639
through my laptop.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.650
So far, so good?

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.820
So what's going to happen is
when I make a request in my

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.320
mobile browser, it'll
go to my laptop.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.230
My laptop will go to the server
and just kind of funnel

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.560
data back and forth.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.410
Now, given that the data is
flowing through the laptop, we

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:02.230
can actually capture the data
with a low-level tool like a

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.890
TCP dump, or Wireshark.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.340
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.120
I was going to say with
Wireshark, you can capture

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.400
everything.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.520
ILYA GRIGORIK: We can just say
capture on this interface, or

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.770
this specific port, or this IP,
all that kind of stuff.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.110
So you run that capture, and
what you get out of it is a

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.720
PCAP file, which is just
a very low-level--

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.030
here are the IP packets and TCP
packets that are flowing

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.910
over the wire.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:28.420
So this is nothing that you
would consume without an

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.330
additional tool.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.680
PETER LUBBERS: It's not
in a HAR format.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.240
ILYA GRIGORIK: No.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:32.950
Unfortunately not.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.170
I actually have a file that
I'll show you guys.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:41.720
I have a sample Wikipedia file
where I captured a PCAP file.

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.320
If I just open this in
Vim, it's gibberish.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.390
Because it's a binary format,
not anything too interesting.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:53.530
Now it turns out that there is
actually a tool called PCAP to

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.800
HAR, which will take those
IP packets and basically

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.780
reconstruct--

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.230
or TCP packets, and reconstruct
the entire flow

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.770
and create a HAR file.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:11.230
Actually, let me see if I
can find this tool here.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.470
You can use PCAP to HAR
to manually do this.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:14.580
So you capture the PCAP file.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.430
And then you get a HAR file out
of it, and then you can

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.920
use the HAR Ruby gem
to visualize it.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.520
Or there's this web app which
allows you to just

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.230
upload a PCAP file.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.990
And it'll do the encoding,
and it will just

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:27.360
show you the thing.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.090
Let me show you this.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:31.644
So I have my Wikipedia
HAR file here.

00:36:31.644 --> 00:36:33.590
PETER LUBBERS: No,
it's a PCAP file.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.350
ILYA GRIGORIK: Sorry,
PCAP file.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.490
And I'm just going
to hit Upload.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.420
And so we're doing is we're
uploading the raw binary data.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.630
It's going to run the
transform to HAR.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.770
And look at that.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.560
Now we're looking at are the
waterfall chart as captured

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.690
from a mobile phone that perhaps
you couldn't configure

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.630
a proxy server on it or using
some browser that doesn't

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.050
support remote debugging.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:36:59.490
PETER LUBBERS: Can you
grab the HAR--

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.110
the raw data on the
other tab there?

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.720
The HAR JSON, yeah, OK.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.610
ILYA GRIGORIK: You can also
explore it, or you can click

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.180
on the Download HAR File,
and there you go.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:10.980
PETER LUBBERS: Full circle.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.870
ILYA GRIGORIK: So this tool--

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.600
and we're only scratching
the surface, here.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.460
We just spent what?

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.560
40 minutes talking about
all the different

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.120
ways we can use this.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.410
But I think we've only scratched
the surface.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.890
Because we can use
it on the server.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:27.250
We can use it to automate
performance monitoring.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.240
I think instrumentation
is key.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.690
So having tools like-- combining
tools like HAR

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.570
Storage, HAR Viewer and others,
you can literally

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:40.380
build a performance monitoring
dashboard for your site or for

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.710
your company in a
couple of hours.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:44.190
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, because
there's so many

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:45.440
tools around it.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.490
So let's see if we have
any other questions.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.370
Oh, first of all, the links.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.240
ILYA GRIGORIK: We covered
a lot of stuff in here.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.590
So I actually created a quick
gist of a whole bunch of

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.080
different links for some of
the tools that we covered.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.600
I tried to capture
them all here.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.430
So if you guys go to
bit.ly/har-show, you'll find

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:11.300
all the links in there.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.000
And we'll actually also push
out a blog post later today

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.920
with a little bit more
information on it.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.085
PETER LUBBERS: Put it on their
Chrome Developers, Google+

00:38:19.085 --> 00:38:19.610
page and link to it.

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.800
ILYA GRIGORIK: But I would
definitely encourage you guys

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.130
to just explore it, play
with the HAR viewer.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.410
Definitely try Phantom and see
what you can do with it.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.100
Actually, one quick
note on Phantom.

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:33.330
When you download the file, it
comes with example files.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:34.700
I showed you the NetSniff.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.410
There's actually a small
bug in the NetSniff

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:37.910
file, which I fixed.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:43.780
And you guys should go to the
GitHub page for Phantom and

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.480
just copy the latest
NetSniff file.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.660
So it's there, it's fixed.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:49.500
It's just not on the latest
release, so just FYI.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.090
PETER LUBBERS: We'll make
a note of it on here.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.510
Let's take a look if there's
any questions on the--

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:56.860
OK, there's a couple.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.320
ILYA GRIGORIK: So we got a
question from Steve Sauders.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.950
Wow, I think I know that guy.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.250
"Does a HAR file contain
the response bodies?"

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.460
So by default, when you export
out of, let's say, Chrome

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:10.230
Developer Tools, it does not
contain the response body.

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.030
But there is no reason
why it can't.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.990
So if you're writing your own
tool, so for example, if

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:19.820
you're scripting Phantom or
something like that, no reason

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.840
why you can't include it.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:24.380
And I think would be really
cool if, for example, HTTP

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.900
Archive actually stored
the bodies--

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.070
sorry, httparchive.org,
the site.

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.770
And then you could do
more interesting

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.070
analysis over time.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.500
PETER LUBBERS: Sure.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.890
They would require a lot
more storage space.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:37.980
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes,
absolutely.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.270
PETER LUBBERS: I think that's
why it's not there by default.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.830
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.950
Well, exactly.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.510
PETER LUBBERS: "What about
compressing HAR files?"

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.630
Interesting.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.800
ILYA GRIGORIK:Well, yeah, as we
saw, we exported one trace,

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.840
5,000 lines of JSON.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.730
If you're storing these things
over time, you probably want

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.450
to compress them, and they will
compress incredibly well.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.610
Coming out of Chrome Dev Tools
or other tools, you're just

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.680
going to get the raw
file, the raw JSON.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.410
It's up to you if you want to
store it, to archive it-- or,

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:10.600
sorry, to compress it.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.030
PETER LUBBERS: So "can the HAR
format be extended to support

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.240
information about requests
that don't make it to the

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:19.060
server, but instead hit the
cache?" Interesting.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.270
ILYA GRIGORIK: Actually, if
you capture the-- if you

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:23.780
export out of Chrome
Dev Tools, it will

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.030
contain that data.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.530
If you load your developer
tools, it does show requests

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.030
that are coming from
the cache.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.050
It actually indicates that.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:38.240
And it will be there in
the exported HAR data.

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.390
And the reason they-- usually
the quick way to spot it is

00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:44.160
when you look at those chunks
of JSON, you will see that

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.670
some requests don't have
any HTTP headers.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.080
That's a giveaway that this
came out of the cache.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.570
PETER LUBBERS: A couple more.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.670
ILYA GRIGORIK: So "BrowserMob
proxy will capture and produce

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:01.870
a HAR file.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.680
And Charles can also be used as
a proxy to generate HAR."

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.740
right, so I think this is more
of a note from Andy, which is

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:12.290
a really good point, which is we
talked about exporting this

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.740
out of a browser.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:18.200
But you can use a tool like
Charles Proxy, or Fiddler, or

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.460
something else where it's
a standalone app.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.960
So I could actually run a proxy
server on my laptop, and

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.470
then connect from this laptop
here to just proxy everything

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.650
through it, and capture this
data, capture the HAR files on

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.120
this device.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.420
So that's a really good point.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.810
PETER LUBBERS: OK, one more.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:40.680
"When you were looking at the
HAR viewer, a JPEG appeared as

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.830
the first request rather
than the HTML page.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.250
Why does this happen?"

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.270
ILYA GRIGORIK: That's
a good question.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.300
That could be a bug.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:55.340
But every request that is made
has a timestamp within the

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:55.905
actual export.

00:41:55.905 --> 00:41:59.150
So it'll say when the request
started, which is how we

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.490
determine in Dev Tools
where in the

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.350
timeline it should live.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:06.280
So I'm not sure if the HAR spec
specifically says that it

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.850
must be sorted in order.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.170
Maybe it does, maybe
it doesn't.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.540
But you can easily resort that
data based on the timestamp

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.560
and get the exact timeline.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.240
Cool.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.810
So I think that that
covers it.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.450
PETER LUBBERS: That was great.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.220
ILYA GRIGORIK: This is
definitely a power tool.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.800
Lots and lots of stuff that
you can do with it.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.160
And I think, once again,
instrumentation is key for

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.500
anything to do with
performance.

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.450
PETER LUBBERS: And all these
tools, there's so much support

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.570
for it that this is really the
way to go for all of this--

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:38.760
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah, so I
definitely encourage you guys

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.460
to play with it.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.300
PETER LUBBERS: So we'll
post the links.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:49.320
We'll post it on the Chrome
Developer Google+ page.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.370
You'll be posting your
blog pretty soon?

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:53.710
ILYA GRIGORIK: I'll have a blog
post up soon as well,

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.830
just documenting some of
the examples here.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.370
And then maybe just
one quick note.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:58.630
I think we're done with this.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.240
But in our next episode, we're
actually going to take a look

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.300
at Google web fonts, which
is going to be

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.660
a really fun topic.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.840
I love web fonts.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.160
A lot of people have issues with
web fonts when it comes

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.990
to performance.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:14.050
So we're going to do a deep dive
on what it takes to make

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.920
web fonts fast and what Google
Web Fonts specifically does to

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.980
make web fonts fast.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.270
PETER LUBBERS: And that's
in two weeks?

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:20.130
Same time, right?

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.030
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep, two weeks.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.710
So yeah, Tuesday.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:24.410
PETER LUBBERS: We'll
announce it.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:25.010
Excellent.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.690
ILYA GRIGORIK: Awesome.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:26.470
Thank you guys.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.592
PETER LUBBERS: Thanks a lot.

00:43:27.592 --> 00:43:35.960
