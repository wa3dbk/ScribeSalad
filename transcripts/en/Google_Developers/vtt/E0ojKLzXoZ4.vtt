ALICE BOXHALL: Hi,
my name is Boxhall.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.910
I'm a developer on the
Chrome accessibility team.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.990
I have a bit of a cold,
so I'm sorry if I'm

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.926
a little hoarse here.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.910
That's cool.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.201
I didn't need to use my slides.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.820
So I'll get into the guts
of my talk in a second,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.870
but I just really like this
definition of accessibility

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.850
that you can find on
good old Wikipedia.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.540
Accessibility is the degree
to which a product, device,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.640
service, or environment is
available to as many people as

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.682
possible.

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.140
And what I like about this is
it doesn't make any reference

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.950
to ability or disability.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.600
It includes people
who are in a hurry.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.230
It includes people who
are using a mobile device.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.610
It includes people who find
small click targets really,

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.360
really irritating.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.020
And to make it more
explicit, I think

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.350
that accessibility actually
implies multi-device

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.550
because you're making your
product accessible to people

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.480
in a wide variety of situations
and for a wide variety

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.510
of backgrounds.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.160
So today I'm going to talk
about what inaccessibility looks

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.830
like, so the types of
patterns and things

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.680
that are going to make your site
inaccessible to various groups

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.830
of people.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.930
I'm going to introduce
screen readers.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.750
If anyone has never
experienced a screen reader,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.220
I'm going to give
a demo and explain

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.650
how you can try out a
screen reader yourself.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.400
I'll talk about what
you can do to improve

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.000
the accessibility
of your site, how

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.400
to assess the
accessibility of your site,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.990
and then I'll have some links
at the end for more information.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.240
So what does
inaccessibility look like?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.420
What constitutes
inaccessibility?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.720
Well, here's a good example.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.030
Anyone seen this on a mobile
device or even their computer?

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.122
Yeah?

00:01:47.122 --> 00:01:48.900
It sucks, right?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.800
So this is what it's like when
you cannot access something.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.560
So different users are going
to require different things,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.850
obviously.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.730
So we have a bunch
of different groups

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.360
that we need to
consider, low vision,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.500
hearing impaired or deaf,
low motor abilities.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.560
So this is someone-- it can
range from having a tremor

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.480
or having poor
motor control, right

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.430
through to having no use
of your hands at all.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.560
Screen reader or
braille display user.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.050
So this could-- I'll get
more into that later.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.390
And voice control user.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.130
So this is the extreme end
of lack of motor ability.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.370
And in almost all
cases, accommodating

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.020
these needs improves the
experience for everybody.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.480
So who are the users that
we're addressing here?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.490
So 9.2% of the adult
population of the US--

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.770
more in developing countries--
have some vision trouble.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.900
So the way that you address
this is very simple.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.860
Avoid low contrast
text because really,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.140
who likes reading low
contrast text anyway?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.630
Avoid relying on color
alone for communication.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.420
Make sure that the
text is resizable.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.780
And as you saw in the
mobile talk earlier,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.860
that's really useful anyway.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.732
Provide text alternatives
to visual media.

00:03:04.732 --> 00:03:06.440
And again, this is
really useful if, say,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.000
you don't want to watch a video
to get the only documentation

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.800
for that dev tool you'd
really like to use.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.280
So 36.4 million adults in
the US have at least one

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.870
complex activity limitation.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.440
So this is motor control.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.190
This type of person
may not be able to use

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.600
a mouse, for example, or
may have significant trouble

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.570
accessing small click targets.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.570
So provide large click targets.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.769
Label your radio buttons.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.310
If I need to use one more form
where the radio buttons aren't

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.880
labeled, and I have to click
on that tiny, tiny circle,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.444
I may actually flip my table.

00:03:38.444 --> 00:03:40.610
Ensure your site can be
used with the keyboard only.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.110
And this is something
that I'm going

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.630
to return to time and time
again because this will actually

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.652
get you a really
long way to making

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:49.860
your site accessible for
the broadest range of users.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.390
So screen reader
and braille users

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.552
are a much smaller number.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:58.260
From the point of view
of the web author,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.120
you guys, these groups are
largely interchangeable,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.960
even though the way
they access the page

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.682
is going to be slightly
different, especially

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.140
in the case of
screen reader users.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.090
They may or may not
actually be blind.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.560
They may have another impairment
such as dyslexia or a learning

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.592
disability.

00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:15.800
They may not be able to read.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.269
They may not be able to
read the target language.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.190
They may be temporarily
unable to read,

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.270
such as recovering from laser
surgery, such as getting

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.457
motion sick, that kind of thing.

00:04:25.457 --> 00:04:27.790
But by and large, the thing
to remember with these users

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.600
is without assisted
technology, they're

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.660
not going to be able to
access the site at all.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.420
So this is the Flash situation.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.920
All right.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.530
So screen readers.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.595
The way that a user
with a screen reader

00:04:40.595 --> 00:04:44.730
is going to be interacting with
a device-- the screen reader

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.100
or braille display
is going to translate

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.680
the interface of a site
into text or speech.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.365
So in this case, we can
imagine the interface has

00:04:58.365 --> 00:04:59.740
a Cancel button
and an OK button.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.480
It's going to read
out, Cancel button.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.791
The user is going to then
hit a keyboard shortcut.

00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:10.500
And so with desktop
screen readers,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.230
there are literally hundreds
of keyboard shortcuts

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.800
to make navigating
really, really efficient.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.680
So they're going to go
to the next control.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.066
It reads out, OK button.

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:20.690
Then they hit another
keyboard shortcut

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.177
to send a click command.

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:23.760
So instead of using
the mouse, they're

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.397
going to be interacting
by the screen reader.

00:05:26.397 --> 00:05:28.730
And then it's going to tell
them that the button's being

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.230
clicked.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.050
All right.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.270
So I have-- this is a
demo of ChromeVox, which

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.760
is a screen reader for
Chrome and Chrome OS.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.940
It's built into
Chrome OS, and I'll

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.320
get to how to use
it in a minute.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.736
But I'll just show
you this first.

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:49.200

00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:16.118
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:17.159
ALICE BOXHALL: All right.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.525
So that was just me going
through the Chrome Dev Summit

00:06:19.525 --> 00:06:21.816
site earlier with ChromeVox
and finding my orientation.

00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:31.250
All right.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.570
So ChromeVox is built
specifically for the web.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.750
It's built in on Chrome OS.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.530
You can activate it
any time on Chrome OS.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.235
And the really
nice feature of it

00:06:40.235 --> 00:06:42.580
is that it's really easy
to use for sighted users.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.690
A lot of screen readers
that are dedicated

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.570
for use by blind
people don't have

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.870
any kind of visual feedback.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.740
They're really difficult to
learn the keyboard shortcuts

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.240
for.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.900
You really need a
lot of training.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.840
But ChromeVox can be
picked up by a beginner

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.310
in about a minute.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:57.920
All right.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.220
So my estimate is 30 seconds.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.840
There's probably a
bit of [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.390
So as I said, keyboard shortcuts
really drive screen readers.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:12.000
So we have a set of modifier
keys we can refer to as cvox.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.030
You can configure it.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.800
It defaults to Control
Alt on Windows an Linux,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.940
Control Command on OS X, and
Search Shift on Chrome OS.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.280
And in Chrome OS, you can
turn it on at any time

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.395
or turn it off with Control
Alt Z. Z And ChromeVox A,

00:07:27.395 --> 00:07:31.620
A will temporarily turn the
ChromeVox feedback on or off

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.170
if you have the extension
installed in Chrome.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.270
So the way you
actually use it-- this

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.420
is the way I will test
things for accessibility

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.580
as an extremely novice
screen reader user.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.170
So use the ChromeVox
keys and up and down

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.750
to navigate through the page.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.580
So this is what I was doing
in the demo a minute ago.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.650
ChromeVox Space
will force a click,

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.660
so that this is how
you click things

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.030
when you don't have a mouse.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.919
Control by itself will make
ChromeVox stop talking.

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.210
And if anyone's curious what
the search command I used,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.793
it's actually ChromeVox
forward slash.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.260
So on mobile devices, the
story's a little bit different.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.730
Obviously, you're not
going to have a keyboard.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.021
You're not going to have all
these hundreds of keyboard

00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:11.660
shortcuts.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.250
But what you do have
is a touch screen.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.690
So what they will do
is use their finger

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.440
to touch the screen
and explore--

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.740
[DING]

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.270
OK.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.120
Explore the screen,
and it will read out

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080
whatever they have touched.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.287
So in this case, we
can imagine a user

00:08:29.287 --> 00:08:30.495
exploring the same interface.

00:08:30.495 --> 00:08:31.643
[DING]

00:08:31.643 --> 00:08:33.059
I really don't
know that sound is.

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:33.559
Sorry.

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.187
Exploring the interface,
finding a button, an OK button

00:08:39.187 --> 00:08:40.020
and a Cancel button.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.100
And this time, they've
clicked the Cancel button.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.647
So TalkBack is built in
on all Android devices.

00:08:47.647 --> 00:08:49.730
You can turn it on from
the accessibility settings

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.990
if you want to try it out.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.042
So then you'll get
a short tutorial

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:57.500
on how to use the
touch exploration

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.083
feature like I was
just talking about.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:02.740
So yeah.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.920
And in this case,
double tapping will

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.310
send-- I think it's
actually a click event,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.190
but it may as well
be a touch event.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.370
And that'll allow the user to
actually interact with things.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.370
On Android, you also
have BrailleBack.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.490
This needs to be installed
from the Play store.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.840
But that will allow
the Android device

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.960
to pair with a braille device.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960
So what I've shown
here is looking

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.740
at the Chrome Dev Summit
site using BrailleBack

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.030
and with the on
screen braille display

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:37.030
to simulate what the
braille device will display.

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.534
So you can see that it's pretty
similar to the spoken feedback,

00:09:40.534 --> 00:09:42.950
except it will have all these
abbreviations so that it can

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.760
fit more information
into a shorter space.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.450
All right.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.130
So what can you
actually do to improve

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.340
the accessibility of your site?

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.760
Start off with the design.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.860
Design with diverse
users in mind.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.780
So when you're looking at how
to create your interactions,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.280
think about how a
keyboard only user

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.310
will interact with your app.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:05.684
Don't assume that
someone's going

00:10:05.684 --> 00:10:07.720
to be able to perform
a hover interaction.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.840
And in fact, someone on
a phone is probably not

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.446
going to be able to perform
a hover interaction either.

00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:13.820
How is a screen
reader user going

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.210
to interact with your site?

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.530
So this means you need to
think about what the text

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.740
alternative, what the
label is for everything.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.400
What's going to be
read out when you

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.810
focused on a particular element?

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:25.274
Is it just going to say, div?

00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:26.940
Do you have images
will all of the text?

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.270
That kind of thing.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.470
And finally, how adaptable
is your interface?

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.020
If something is viewed via
some kind of assistive device

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.680
or viewed maybe by a text only
device, is it going to work?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.320
Or is it just going
to fail horribly?

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.380
So again, ensure that you
have a good keyboard only user

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.360
experience.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.440
And what does this
actually look like?

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.630
Firstly, I shouldn't
need to say this.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.110
But use standard widgets
wherever possible.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:58.544
They come with built
in keyboard handling.

00:10:58.544 --> 00:11:00.210
So the Polymer talk
yesterday went a bit

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.980
into what you get for free
with standard elements.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.660
Use or extend good
custom elements

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.620
with built in keyboard controls.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.110
So when you can't
use standard widgets,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.300
or you want something
that looks a bit different

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.610
or behaves a bit differently,
use good custom elements

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.240
or write your own
good custom elements

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.380
with keyboard handling.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.000
So I'll get into
what you need to do

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.710
to rollout yourself in a minute.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.060
All right.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.781
So if you're writing
your own elements,

00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:29.280
whether you're using
custom elements

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.660
or whether you're just writing
something from scratch,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.400
use tabindex.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.150
That'll make things focusable.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.360
So if you have something
which is a click target

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.300
but isn't focusable,
screen reader

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.135
may actually have
difficulties using it.

00:11:44.135 --> 00:11:45.510
Plus, someone
who's keyboard only

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.718
will never be able to use it.

00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:48.570
I assume you all know
how to use tabindex,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.980
so I won't get into that.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.940
And handle keyboard
events wherever

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.580
you handle click
or touch events.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.100
And if you want to know
which keys to listen for,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.921
follow established user
experience patterns

00:12:01.921 --> 00:12:03.545
for the platform that
you're targeting.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.470
All right.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.640
This is something we may
not necessarily think of,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.280
but it's actually
really irritating

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.720
if you're trying to use
an app keyboard only.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.890
Manage focus.

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.110
So make sure that focus
is in a sensible order

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.990
with the tabindex property.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.650
Make focus visible.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.450
So don't make your user play
find-the-focused-element.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.220
So what does that
game look like?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.249
It looks like this.

00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:27.540
And I'm sorry to pick on Gmail.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.206
It's just that I use
Gmail all the time,

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:30.810
and this really bugs me.

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:32.940
Where's the focus here?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.970
You can see it if
you really squint.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.750
It's actually right there.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.800
If you're showing a pop up
or a modal dialog and so on,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.840
move focus within the
pop up when your open it.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.100
So call focus from JavaScript.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.550
And move focus
back to the element

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.070
that triggered the
pop up on close.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.605
So I've clicked my focused
element, or I pressed Enter.

00:12:54.605 --> 00:12:55.625
And it showed a pop up.

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:56.250
So that's good.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.581
It had keyboard handling.

00:12:58.581 --> 00:12:59.497
Now where's the focus?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.570
It is actually in the pop up.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.690
So that's cool.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.250
However, now when
I close the pop up,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.880
it goes to a random
location in Gmail

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.070
that I haven't actually figured
out what the logic is yet.

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.690
OK.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.830
Next step, express the
semantics of your interface.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.716
So as I keep saying,
use standard widgets

00:13:17.716 --> 00:13:19.090
wherever possible
because they're

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.400
going to have the
semantics built in.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.090
Or use well written
custom elements

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.140
which are handling this for you.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.390
And again, if you're writing
your own custom elements,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.060
or you're writing
things from scratch,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.905
use ARIA to express
the semantics.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:33.950
All right.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.210
So this is a
non-semantic interface.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.770
It's a div that has
an onclick alert,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.060
onclick F This is much better.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.390
It's a bottom.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.150
It still has an
onclick listener.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.530
But it's going to actually
have a tabindex now.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.990
It's going to respond
to keyboard events.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.830
And we have a custom
element, sort of,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.200
that we've given an ARIA role.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.783
So that is now going to also be
presented to the screen reader

00:14:03.783 --> 00:14:04.750
as a button.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.520
But that's not really
the whole story.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.080
You still need to make
it focusable and handle

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.034
key events.

00:14:12.034 --> 00:14:14.450
So what's ARIA, this ARIA thing
that I keep talking about?

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.610
It stands for Accessible
Rich Internet Applications.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.490
It's a W3C standard.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.510
And it allows you to express
roles, states, and properties

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.820
for elements via
HTML attributes.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:32.100
So we saw this role attribute,
that's an ARIA attribute.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.770
So what that does-- the reason
I keep going on about semantics

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.410
is that screen readers
are all about semantics.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.200
It's going to view a
modified version of the DOM

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.212
that just tells it
what the role and what

00:14:47.212 --> 00:14:48.420
the text is for each element.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.690
It's not interested in images.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.700
It's not interested in layout.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.350
And so we see here is
we've applied a role

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.460
to this div and an ARIA label,
which is an ARIA property.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.765
And that gets rendered
to the screen reader

00:15:02.765 --> 00:15:04.900
as an actual button
and allows the user

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.690
to interact with this as
if it was an actual button.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:12.356
OK.

00:15:12.356 --> 00:15:13.105
Thanks, Presently.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.390
We have a native button.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.690
And as we saw in the
Polymer talk yesterday,

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.390
this comes out
looking like a button.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.810
And it comes out
indirect with a-- sorry,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.430
with a JavaScript
DOM object, which

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.170
allows you access all
the attributes you

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.950
would expect for a button.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.540
It also comes out with
an accessibility tree,

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.860
which is mangled
because reasons.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.360
That tells the screen reader
that there's a button.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.079
And it has a press state, an
on press state, and so on.

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:51.370
For custom elements, you need
to do a little more work.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.150
So in this case, the
custom element author

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.600
has made it so that the custom
element will write these ARIA

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.910
role and attribute
when the custom

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.850
element is rendered to the page.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.040
So then we end up with
a similar situation

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.580
as we do for native
elements, where

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.770
we have a visual rendering.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.010
We have a DOM
object that lets us

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.730
access the attributes that we
want and interact with them

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:19.790
and get a good
developer experience

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.030
but also have an accessibility
tree, which makes sense

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.120
to a screen reader or
braille display user.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.620
OK.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:33.410
So how can you actually assess
the accessibility of your site?

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.250
Firstly, try it without a mouse.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.900
Try it without a track pad.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.720
I saw this great tweet
from someone saying,

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.200
the track pad on my MacBook
Air broke, and I'm on a plane.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.340
To all site
developers everywhere,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.380
please fix your accessibility.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.870
Try out a screen reader.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.920
The way you use a
screen reader will not

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.750
be the same as the way an
experienced screen reader user

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.550
uses it.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.510
But it will give you an idea
of what things are labeled,

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.220
what things are accessible
via the screen reader,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.650
when focus has gone horribly
wrong, that kind of thing.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.210
It's worth just trying it out.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.300
And you can also do
automated testing.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.950
So there's this
extension for Chrome

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.640
called Accessibility
Developer Tools.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.109
And it's also a
JavaScript library,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.839
so you can use it in
your continuous testing.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.970
And I'll give you a
demonstration of that.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.690
All right.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.280
It comes up in the Audits tab.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:31.850
Yup.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:35.680
It comes up in the Audits
tab of the developer tools.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.480
So it just comes up here.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.120
I've run it already on
this page obviously.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.100
And it's come up with
a couple of-- well,

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.460
many errors for this page, a
couple I'd like to highlight.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.370
So we have this here.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.890
It says-- it's unfortunately
cropped by the page.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.270
But it says, these elements are
focusable but either invisible

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.430
or obscured by another element.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.390
So what's happened here is we
have focusable elements that

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.609
are behind this modal dialogue,
which for a screen reader user

00:18:04.609 --> 00:18:06.400
are going to come up
as completely visible,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.612
even though to a sighted user
they're obviously inaccessible.

00:18:09.612 --> 00:18:11.570
It's going to be a really
confusing experience.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.240
And what we want
to do is make sure

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.364
that everything that is
hidden behind this dialogue

00:18:15.364 --> 00:18:17.630
has an ARIA attribute,
which will hide it

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.960
from a screen reader.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.080
You possibly also want to set
the tabindex to negative 1

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.010
to make sure that it's
not part of the tab order.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:30.020
And then here we have-- it
says text elements should

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.000
have a reasonable
contrast ratio.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.240
So when I was talking
earlier about users

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.170
with low vision or
even just anyone

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.950
using a mobile device
in bright sunlight,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.510
low contrast text
is a real pain.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.109
And so I'll just demonstrate
a neat feature that it has,

00:18:46.109 --> 00:18:48.400
which is that I can look at
this in the Elements panel.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.430
And it'll actually come
up with suggestions

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.710
for colors I could use instead.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.670
So yeah, slightly
darker and much darker.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:03.536
And finally, so here--
one thing that's

00:19:03.536 --> 00:19:04.910
always bugged me
about using ARIA

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.664
is that when you
write incorrect HTML5,

00:19:07.664 --> 00:19:09.080
the DevTools is
going to tell you.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.320
And it's going to
come up as an error.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.690
When you write incorrect
ARIA, you really

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.330
have no feedback until you try
using it with a screen reader

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.060
and discover that
it doesn't work.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.959
So here we have a progress bar.

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:22.750
And I'll show you what's
actually happened.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.359
So I've tried to set
the value to 80%,

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:30.900
but it turns out
ARIA value now takes

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.140
a number instead of a string.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:38.010
So when I try and view that
with ChromeVox-- actually, no.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.091
I can't do that.

00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:41.090
Anyway, when I try and
view that with ChromeVox,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.690
it actually says,
progress not a number

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.870
percent, which is
really embarrassing.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.180
So I can actually fix that.

00:19:50.656 --> 00:19:52.405
And now it's telling
me that it's correct.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:19:59.280
All right.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.000
So just to sum up,
improving accessibility

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.020
will almost always improve
the experience for everyone.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.394
Even when you're looking at
screen reader accessibility,

00:20:08.394 --> 00:20:10.310
what you're doing is
expressing your interface

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.450
more semantically, which will
improve the maintainability

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.740
and testability of your code.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.281
There are testing
tools that actually

00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:18.490
look at the accessibility
tree in order

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.380
to create interaction tests.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.290
Keep diverse users in mind
at all stages of development.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.940
So when you're designing, when
you're building your interface,

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.880
when you're testing,
make sure that you're

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.840
testing the interactions
that anyone would use.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.330
Have a good keyboard only story.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.994
If you do one thing,
please do that.

00:20:38.994 --> 00:20:40.910
Express your interface
semantically as well as

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:41.520
visually.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.280
I think I've covered that.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.760
Use automated and manual
accessibility testing.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.700
So I demonstrated a bit of
how to do both of those.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.540
And finally, listen
to your users.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.000
If you have users filing
accessibility bugs,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.180
follow up with them.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.540
Figure out what's going wrong.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.940
And finally, we have some links.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.000
So a bunch of screen
readers that you can try.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.670
I demonstrated ChromeVox.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.230
There's also a screen
reader built into-- I

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.290
showed you some
screenshots of TalkBack.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:14.210
There are screen readers built
into every Mac desktop and iOS

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.500
device, which is VoiceOver.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.040
So you can use that as
well and a few other ones.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.990
So these are all free.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.760
A bunch of them are open source.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.890
And so as much as we were
writing on the Web Content

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.220
Accessibility Guidelines,
actually worth a read.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.160
The WAI-ARIA spec is there.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.430
The accessibility developer
tools extension and library

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.930
are there.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.555
You can also search
for them on Google.

00:21:38.555 --> 00:21:40.630
They're pretty high up
in the search results.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.390
And that's all I have.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:43.620
Thanks a lot.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:50.370
[APPLAUSE]
