EVE ANDERSSON: Today we're going to talk about
a free online course we've developed called

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.880
"Introduction to Web Accessibility." We will
learn about some of the tools and techniques

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.880
in this course for making websites more accessible
to people with vision impairments. My name

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.170
is Eve Andersson. I'm a manager in accessibility
engineering here at Google. And we have a

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:40.909
distinguished panel to my left of accessibility
experts. On my far left is Vint Cerf. He is

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.829
a VP at Google and our Chief Internet Evangelist.
Some have also referred to him as "one of

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.539
the Fathers of the Internet." We also have
Charles Chen, an engineer in accessibility,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.530
and he's one of the developers of this course.
We have one more panelist who wasn't able

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.440
to be with us today. His name is T.V. Raman.
He is a research scientist at Google, and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.320
he works on accessibility. He also helped
develop this course, and we'll see him later

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.720
in a video. All right, the first question
is for you, Vint. Vint, why should people

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.910
- why should software developers learn about
accessibility?

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.680
VINT: Well, let's start with a very fundamental
point: not all of the websites in the world

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.740
are readily accessible to people who need
some assistance. If you happen to be blind

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.220
or have vision impairment, you can't see the
web pages, and you can't interact with them

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.760
in the way others can. If you happen to be
deaf, or in my case, I'm hearing impaired,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.500
there are times when you can't actually quite
make out the audio, and it would help a lot

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.170
if we could see captions or written material
to go along with it. There are other people

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.050
who have a variety of other problems that
have to be accommodated. And so this whole

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.890
notion is about assistance to make things
useful and accessible for everyone. The reason

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
that it's important to do that is twofold.
First it's the right thing to do. We want

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.690
everyone to take advantage of and be able
to use the benefits and fruitful content available

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.950
on the internet. But perhaps more important,
it's ironic that the one tool that's been

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.410
invented in the last several years - the computer
- is the one thing that can, in fact, make

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.540
things accessible because it's so flexible.
We can write programs to adapt and accommodate.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.770
And yet that's the one area that has been
poorly treated for many, many years. It's

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.190
almost as strange as the telephone invented
by Alexander Graham Bell intending to help

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.940
the deaf and being useless to them until somebody
finally invented things like email and teletypes

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.940
and so on. So we have an obligation to take
this new technology and make it work for everyone

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.930
on the planet regardless of the needs that
they may have for assistance.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.690
EVE: Thank you, Vint. So one of the things
you said was that we want the web to work

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.690
for everyone, and it currently doesn't. Charles,
could you show us what the web looks like

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.740
to someone who's blind?
CHARLES: Sure, Eve. So if we switch to my

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.690
screen here, I have a very simple example
running. And what you'll see is that-- I'm

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.110
going to go over it twice. The first time
I'm going to show you what it looks like visually.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.360
And then I'll show you what someone with a
visual impairment would experience the site

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.340
as. So as you can see, I have this page up
here. It looks like a simple enough page.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.440
It has a title, "Button and Alert." There's
a button, and if I click it, I'll get an alert.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.300
So I'm just going to click it with the mouse,
click it. "The button has been pressed!" No

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.430
problems. But now let's see what a user with
a visual impairment would experience. So I'm

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.430
going to turn on my screen reader here.
CHROMEVOX: ChromeVox is ready. Button and

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.170
Alert Example tab.
CHARLES: All right, so now my screen reader

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.699
is enabled. Let me navigate through this,
and let's experience what I hear.

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.570
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate
an alert. Smile image.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.180
CHARLES: Smile image. OK, that was interesting.
CHROMEVOX: If this were a real page, we would

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.530
have more content here.
CHARLES: Wait. Where was the button? OK, maybe

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.699
it was the smile image. Let's try that.
CHROMEVOX: Smile image.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:40.570
CHARLES: OK, I'm going to try and press Enter
to click it. Hm. OK, nothing's happening.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.630
Well, I'm a really good screen reader user,
so I know that I can try to generate some

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.630
sort of fake click event. Let me try and force
click this.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.370
CHROMEVOX: Clicked. Smile image.
CHARLES: It says I clicked it, but I'm not

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.810
hearing anything. As you can see, this is
a pretty broken experience, and it's really

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.790
difficult to use if you have a visual impairment,
even for something as simple as this page.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.460
EVE: Thanks for that. As I said earlier, TV
Raman can't be with us here today. But we

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.180
spent some time with him yesterday, and we'll
see a video where he talks a little bit more

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.900
about the content of the course, about accessible
development, as well as how we came up with

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.030
doing this course.
TV RAMAN: When you put up a website or you

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.310
write a web page, you actually don't know
who your audience is. Your audience could

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.250
be in the United States. Your audience could
be worldwide. Your audience might be English

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.970
speaking. Your audience might be speaking
another language as their first language.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:48.970
So it's all about reach. And if it's all about
reach, then optimizing your content to cater

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:57.110
to the widest variety of needs is something
in everybody's interest. We thought wouldn't

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:04.889
it be nice to try using this new medium of
online education to teach something that deeply

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.889
affects the online experience. So, can we
use this online medium of web courses and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:20.430
web-based education to teach web developers
how to make their websites and web contents

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:27.240
maximally useful and usable to all of their
audience? So during this class, we will both

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:34.240
teach you how to enhance your content for
accessibility and then also teach you to use

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:43.389
tools that check whether you have done the
needed work to make your content accessible

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:49.449
and also give you an opportunity to use tools
that let you experience firsthand what your

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.310
site feels like to someone who cannot see
and is trying to listen to your site. So in

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.259
a nutshell, we'll teach you techniques for
enhancing your content. We will show you tools

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:04.220
that let you first check your content, and
you'll get warnings and tips on ways we can

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.990
fix it. And then you'll fix it and actually
be able to experience a before-and-after.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.750
We want to keep things simple for this first
course. And so we are going to narrow down

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.750
and focus on things you can do when you create
your content to make it work well for users

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:27.970
who are blind or users who have low vision.
That isn't to say that those are the only

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.020
problems you need to worry about. But this
will get you a part of the way to starting

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.520
to think about accessibility and about all
your users. So when you think about accessibility,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.300
don't think of it as something special for
a few users. Think of it as designing your

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.300
content and site so that it works for everyone
independent of their needs who might happen

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:59.009
to come to your site. Accessibility is really
about you reaching the maximum number of devices,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.430
the maximum number of users, the maximum number
of needs and abilities. Our goal is to whet

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.740
your appetite and get you interested. And
at the end of the course, we will point you

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:15.610
at additional resources that will let you
deep dive into specific areas. So enjoy the

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.539
course, and I hope to see you at the other
end of this course, where you are making your

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:25.530
sites address a lot more of the accessibility
issues that arise.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:32.530
EVE: So in the video, Raman gave us a brief
overview of the content of the course. And

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:39.539
he mentioned that there are tools that let
you as a web developer experience a website

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:46.380
as a blind person does, as well as to help
you make a site more accessible. Can you show

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.130
us a little bit more about these tools?
CHARLES: Sure, Eve. So the two tools that

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.820
we'll be using primarily in this course are
Accessibility Developer Tools and ChromeVox.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.770
Both of these are extensions that are freely
available on the Chrome Web Store, and you

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:07.760
can go ahead and download them. As you can
see on my screen, I have these tools installed.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.230
So let's start with Accessibility Developer
Tools. These tools are some really simple,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:17.910
really quick audits that will tell you if
you have problems with your web page. Now

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:23.880
let's try running this audit on an example
and let's see what it tells us. So I'm going

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:30.880
to go to Tools - I'm going to bring up Developer
Tools. And now if I switch into my Audits

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.670
panel, I can select Accessibility and I can
ask it to run the audit. So I'm going to run

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:42.890
the audit, and you see right here I get a
warning. The warning tells me that images

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.890
should have an alt attribute. Let's go ahead
and try to fix this. Ah, smile.png. That's

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.130
why it was saying 'smile image' rather than
the actual text of the button. So let's try

00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:03.130
and fix this. Let me switch over to my text
editor here. Okay, so here is where I have

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:11.950
the image. I'm going to go ahead and add alt
text that make sense: alt="I'm a button.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:23.450
Click me! smiley face" Okay, so let's save
this, and let's go back to the page, and let's

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:33.300
see what the audit says this time. Okay, as
you can see, I no longer have that warning.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:43.170
So that's good. That's definitely an improvement.
And now let's move on to the next tool, ChromeVox.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.350
So ChromeVox is our screen reader for Chrome
OS. It's also available as a Chrome extension

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.290
that anyone can install and try out. As a
web developer, this tool is really nice because

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.519
it gives you a way to experience what a blind
user would experience directly in your browser

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:03.200
without any real additional setup aside from
just installing the extension and enabling

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.480
it. So I'm going to go ahead and enable the
extension now. And let's try running through

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.290
this page again and let's see what it sounds
like.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:18.060
CHROMEVOX: ChromeVox is ready. Button and
Alert Example tab.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.550
CHARLES: OK, so let's go ahead and read through
this page now.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:27.550
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate
an alert. I'm a button. Click me! Smiley face.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.149
CHARLES: OK, so that's nice. It told me what
this button has, but let's see. CHROMEVOX:

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:37.000
If this were a real page, we would have more
content here.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.370
CHARLES: OK, well, from the text of that image,
I got the impression that it's a button. But

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.350
it still didn't tell me that it was actually
a button from a screen reader's perspective.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.290
Also, if I move over it, I think I still won't
be able to click it. Let's see.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.410
CHROMEVOX: I'm a button. Click me. Smiley
face.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.959
CHARLES: Yeah, OK, so I still can't activate
it. So I think we still need a little bit

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:05.829
of work here, so let's go ahead and fix this.
Now, the nice thing is, even though this is

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:10.920
a pretty broken experience that we're starting
with, it's relatively easy to fix and correct,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:17.920
as I will proceed to demonstrate. So let me
switch back to the code. And now one of the

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:24.360
first things to fix is to make sure that this
is actually reported to screen readers as

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:31.360
a button. So I'm going to add an ARIA role:
role="button" that makes sense. And let's

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:40.649
also make this button focusable and respond
to the Enter key. So I'm going to put: tabindex="0"

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:50.019
and I'm going to add a keydown handler. And
of course, I need to write the function for

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:05.390
a keydown handler, which is really quick.
All right, so this should do the trick. Let's

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:34.839
reload and let's see what this is like.
CHROMEVOX: Window Button and Alert. Example

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:41.410
Button and Alert Example. I'm a button. Click
me! Smiley face. Button.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:48.000
CHARLES: OK, so as you can see now, this time
it actually reported that it was a button.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.610
And let's try clicking it. OK, this was a
little bit better. It responded to the Enter

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:59.380
key. But still, as a blind user, I wouldn't
have heard the message that came up. So let's

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:06.380
go ahead and let's fix that. So all I need
to do here is, because it's an alert, I just

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:14.769
give need to give it an ARIA role of alert:
role="alert" And let's try this again.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:20.440
CHROMEVOX: Window Button and Alert. Example
Tab. Button and-- Button and Alert.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.959
CHARLES: OK, so I'm going to try this again.
CHROMEVOX: Click the button below to generate

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:28.589
an alert. I'm a button, Click me! Smiley face.
Button.

00:14:28.589 --> 00:14:32.760
CHARLES: And now I'm going to press Enter.
CHROMEVOX: The button has been pressed. Alert.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.170
CHARLES: Yay! So now this all works. So as
you can see with just a little bit of code,

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.920
I was able to take a completely broken experience
and make it work reasonably well.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:49.589
EVE: Thanks for that demo, Charles. So I saw
in that, that you were editing HTML and JavaScript.

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:53.139
CHARLES: Yes.
EVE: What do people need to know before they

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:55.839
can embark on this course? Who is this course
for?

00:14:55.839 --> 00:14:59.880
CHARLES: Glad you asked that. So this course
is for web developers. You do need to have

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.310
some basic understanding of HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS. But really it's for all levels of

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.850
web developers. You don't necessarily have
to be a JavaScript ninja to do well in this

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.040
course.
VINT: Well, that looked pretty simple, actually.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.490
CHARLES: Yeah, so I think what was helpful
here was that the starting design was actually

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.200
fairly simple, fairly straightforward. There
was nothing in the design itself that made

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:27.920
it inherently inaccessible. You have a button.
You click on it. You get a reaction. As such,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.339
if the missing piece for accessibility is
at a technical level, where things aren't

00:15:32.339 --> 00:15:36.740
labeled, or you don't have the right ARIA
properties, or you don't have the right keyboard

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.930
handlers, then it is really simple to take
these problems and address them. And you can

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.839
fix them in a short amount of time. And these
are also the type of solutions that we'll

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:48.610
be covering in the course. The course is a
great starting point to help you learn about

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:52.070
these fixes.
VINT: So I would take away from this example,

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.990
Charles, two things. First of all, the tool
that helped you discover that there was a

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.570
problem could be very helpful if you have
a significant amount of code - having something

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:05.490
staring over your shoulder and saying, "Don't
forget, you need to do something about that,"

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:10.500
I think is very helpful. And you demonstrated
that for at least some of the problems that

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.529
are identified, the fix is not all that hard.
I think that on a deeper level, though, understanding

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:22.350
how to create designs that can be made accessible
is a much tougher proposition. You really

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:28.660
have to put your head somehow in the same
place as someone who's using this with need

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:34.190
for assistance. And so although this course
is at the beginning, so to speak, at some

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.199
point I hope we can help people understand
what it means to do really good accessible

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:43.680
engineering. And that, of course, is the ultimate
objective to all of what we're trying to accomplish.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.810
CHARLES: Absolutely, Vint. At a deeper level,
design matters, right? So having a good accessible

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:55.149
design or at least a design that can be made
accessible is key. We can do all the technical

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:59.310
fixes we want to, but that's not going to
compensate for a really bad design if you

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.110
start with that.
VINT: Exactly right.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:07.519
EVE: So how can people do accessible design?
CHARLES: I think it's about thinking through

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:13.089
your entire workflow and making it so that
there are multiple ways of approaching it

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:17.479
and multiple ways of getting through it. So,
for example, you don't really want to build

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:20.689
a program that says you must use a mouse to
drive it.

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:23.179
EVE: Mmhmm
CHARLES: Instead, think of the task, right?

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:27.939
Something as simple as, say, a drag-and-drop
operation. If you made it so that the only

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:33.450
way to add something was via drag and drop,
then you have a serious accessibility problem.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.559
Because for a user with physical impairments
who can't use a mouse, or for a blind user

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:43.220
who wouldn't be able to use a mouse and aim
it properly, it will not work for that audience.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.369
However, if you expanded-- if you took a step
back and thought about the problem you're

00:17:47.369 --> 00:17:52.109
trying to solve, which is to get the user
intent of: they take something from bucket

00:17:52.109 --> 00:17:57.090
A and they're moving it into bucket B; if
you then think of the problem in that sense,

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.009
then you have a lot of options open. Because
then it doesn't necessarily have to be drag-and-drop.

00:18:02.009 --> 00:18:05.940
Drag-and-drop is one of the ways of moving
something from A into B, but you could also

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:11.259
do it by keyboard by selecting it first and
then doing a cut-and-paste operation. So really

00:18:11.259 --> 00:18:15.639
it's about thinking through the problem that
you're trying to solve and then thinking through

00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:20.289
multiple ways of letting the user indicate
what they wish to do and conveying the results

00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:24.649
back to the user and not forcing them into
just one mode of doing things.

00:18:24.649 --> 00:18:29.879
VINT: Do you suppose now that we're beginning
to see computers getting better and better

00:18:29.879 --> 00:18:36.149
and actually understanding speech, that we
will get into a more conversational interaction

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:40.039
with some of these applications so we can
actually tell it what it is we're trying to

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:43.350
accomplish and have it figure out the best
way to do that?

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.649
CHARLES: I certainly hope so. That's one of
the things that I think is really cool about

00:18:47.649 --> 00:18:52.919
technologies like Google Now and some of the
things that we've shown off at Google I/O.

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:58.159
The nice thing, too, is I think we really
want to think a step ahead of just the computer

00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:04.269
doing exactly what the user said, but rather
having some level of anticipation and assistance

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:08.879
so that the user doesn't necessarily have
to mechanically go through every individual

00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:15.350
step, but rather have a smoother workflow
where they can perform a task and have efficient

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:18.259
task completions.
EVE: From what you describe, Charles, it sounds

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:23.970
like doing things that help people with accessibility
needs has the potential to help everybody

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.179
streamline what they're doing on the computer.
CHARLES: Bingo.

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.539
VINT: That's a really good point.
CHARLES: And that's really something that

00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:31.450
I think everyone should strive for.
EVE: Thank you.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.830
CHARLES: Thanks, Eve.
EVE: So jumping up one level, I want to come

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:42.830
back to something, Vint, that you touched
on earlier. You mentioned, in other words,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.830
that the internet is supposed to level the
playing field for everyone. Can you comment

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:55.379
a little bit more on that?
VINT: Well, I think as Charles has just demonstrated,

00:19:55.379 --> 00:20:01.769
the internet is filled with boulders and mountains
that have to be either climbed or moved in

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:06.950
order to make it - moved, preferably - to
make it a really level playing field. What

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:13.279
I found most interesting about Charles' demonstration
is the level of detail with which you have

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:19.359
to think in order to imagine what your software
is going to be like for someone who's blind.

00:20:19.359 --> 00:20:24.970
You have to similarly try to think your way
through what happens if you have a user who's

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.479
deaf or has some other impairment. What I
think is fundamental here - and the reason

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:35.649
it's important for this class to be taken
by everyone who's interested in making web

00:20:35.649 --> 00:20:42.649
experiences useful for everyone - is the degree
to which you have to imagine how this is going

00:20:43.169 --> 00:20:49.249
to behave for someone who needs assistance.
This is all about harnessing the computer

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:55.789
power that we know is in those boxes to help
someone who needs a little bit of assistance

00:20:55.789 --> 00:21:02.059
to experience the web in a way that is needed
for that particular person. The thing I want

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:09.059
to emphasize here is the diversity of assistance
needs. It's not a simple thing to say, "I

00:21:09.679 --> 00:21:14.909
will do it this way for anyone who has a vision
impairment, and I'll do it this way for someone

00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:21.909
who has an audio problem." In fact, every
single person with one of these variable challenges

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:28.269
may need different nuances - different kinds
of assistance. And so we need a lot of flexibility

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:33.789
built into this environment. It's also, I
think, very important not to imagine that

00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:40.149
you can build a web application and then somehow
sprinkle accessibility pixie dust on it and

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:44.979
have it work. It's much more fundamental than
that, and that's why this class is so important.

00:21:44.979 --> 00:21:51.979
So I want to encourage everyone who has a
desire to make their web pages and their other

00:21:52.419 --> 00:21:59.419
applications accessible to everyone, to take
this class, absorb what you learn from it,

00:21:59.979 --> 00:22:06.979
and then apply it. Because that will, in fact,
make the internet be for everyone.

00:22:07.279 --> 00:22:12.419
EVE: Thank you for watching. This is the end
of our GDL on our new course, Introduction

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:19.349
to Web Accessibility. To close us out, Vint,
what should people watching this GDL do next?

00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:26.349
VINT: That's easy. Sign up for the class,
take it, absorb it, and apply it!
