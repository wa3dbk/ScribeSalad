00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.670
MALE SPEAKER: So we're here back
at Devoxx, and I'm here

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.510
with Ilya Grigorik, who's here
talking about performance and

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.960
Chrome dev tools, and
performance of front

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.900
ends and web apps.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.460
So welcome.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.340
ILYA GRIGORIK: Thank you.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.780
MALE SPEAKER: You were
covering two things.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.110
First of all, in the university
session, how to

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.990
make a website's performance.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.460
And performance is kind
of a black art, I

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.510
think, to a lot of people.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.630
And browsers, at the
same time, are

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.020
pretty complex things.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.770
They're almost like an OS.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.980
So should people try to
understand how it's built, or

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.860
are there any low hanging fruits
or methodology to get

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.840
your things to--

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.360
ILYA GRIGORIK: So really,
it's both.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.860
You should always go for the low
hanging fruit, because, by

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.170
definition, those are the
low hanging fruit.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.280
But I think in general, if you
want to build an application

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.750
that is performant over the
long term, you need to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.110
understand how the mechanics of
your operating system work.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.570
And you mentioned that the
browsers are increasingly

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.140
becoming like an operating
system.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.420
They absolutely are.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.690
You have networking, you have
graphics, you have everything

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.670
in between.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.480
There's literally not a computer
science problem that

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.410
we're not pushing boundaries
on in the modern browser.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.580
That's not there.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.020
So that was in large part what
the session was about.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.190
Of course, you can only fit so
much into three hours, but

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.940
nonetheless it was like three
hours of here's how the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.300
browser works.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.340
MALE SPEAKER: And people can
find your slides online if

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.560
they Google them, I'm sure.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.990
We'll have a link somewhere so
that people can find them.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.980
I think they're very useful,
even with us.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.340
And it will be on [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.910
as well for people to watch.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.250
So how about things like page
speed or using CDNs or DNS

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.220
lookups is an obvious thing
people don't always look into.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.220
These are all good things.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.580
ILYA GRIGORIK: So these are
all techniques, right?

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.530
These are all one component
of a larger picture.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.500
So in the web performance
community, if you will, we

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.440
kind of have this distinction,
which I don't think is

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.960
actually necessarily even fair,
which is back end versus

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
front end performance.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.750
Which is like, the stuff that
happens on your server, and

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.170
then everything that
the browser does.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.539
Whereas I like to take kind of
like a holistic picture, and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.970
say, well, the lifetime of a
page or your app or what have

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.690
you, needs to take into
account both.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.040
Because sometimes maybe your
app is blocked on DNS, and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.300
then the question is,
how do I find out?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.710
How do I measure it?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.080
I guess kind of the other meta
point that I like to make

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.980
about performance is a lot
of people treat it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.460
as a technical metric.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.040
It should be a business
metric.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.750
Performance is a feature.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.050
There are products out there
where speed is a feature.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.910
Think of Google search.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.160
Speed is a feature, absolutely,
and you should

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.525
design for it as such.

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:43.110
So if you can connect speed
and performance to your

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.970
business or bottom
line metrics--

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.570
and in fact, I've shown a number
of case studies from

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.200
other companies outside of
Google where they see a direct

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.500
correlation between how fast
the page loads and my

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.630
conversions, or bounce rates,
and everything like that.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.390
If you can show that to your
CEO, CFO, your team, even,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.680
that's a viable metric, as
opposed to just being like, on

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.890
a weekend, I'm going to
spend my 20% time

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.170
optimizing the page.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.270
MALE SPEAKER: Well, and it's
interesting to see how people

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.980
actually start using Chrome
dev tools as more like

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.590
development tools, not just the
afterthought, the tool you

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.440
bring up to fix performance
after you've built it.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.200
So people are spending more time
in tools such as the ones

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.930
provided in Chrome.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.170
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.640
So that was kind of my second
talk, which is, the whole

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.110
premise is the browser is
probably one of the most well

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.460
instrumented platforms
that we have today.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.230
And you may just not
realize it yet.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.950
That was kind of the
tagline, right?

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.100
And you can do all
kinds of stuff.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.870
You can do detail, network
debugging, look at the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.010
graphics pipeline, look at the
low level networking, and in

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.090
fact, you have to.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.050
Once you actually get into the
weeds of what is the browser

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.390
doing, that's what you
need to understand.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.010
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.150
ILYA GRIGORIK: And
it is almost like

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.240
an ID at this point.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.140
MALE SPEAKER: True, true.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.520
I see a lot of people, a lot of
developers actually using

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.390
it as such.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.190
So you actually looked at the
Devoxx website as well.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.330
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.100
MALE SPEAKER: And you have a few
things to share with our

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.010
friends organizing the
conference and

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.220
running this website.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.339
What kind of things did you
find, and are they typical of

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.250
things you find elsewhere?

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.220
ILYA GRIGORIK: They were
actually typical, and I have

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.140
to say, the Devoxx site actually
was pretty good, all

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.840
things considered.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.790
So no complaints there.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.250
So some interesting takeaways.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.940
An average page on the internet
today is about one

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.270
megabyte in size.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.240
One meg.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.480
I find this number surprising,
right, the first

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.250
time I heard it.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.860
And it's composed of
over 80 requests.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.290
So one page, where there
is 80 resources--

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.240
images, JavaScript, CSS--

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.830
that need to come in to compose
the page, and we're

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.680
connecting on average to over
30 servers to fetch all of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.720
that data, right?

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.140
And of course, as users, we
expect all of this to happen

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.610
instantaneously.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.650
It's like, yes, connect to 30
servers, compose all of this,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.900
and just instantly display it.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.200
I think for Devoxx, if memory
serves, it was more requests.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.120
It was like 140 requests.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.620
But nonetheless, it was
structured well, so it loaded

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.870
pretty fast.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.030
So they did a good job.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.400
MALE SPEAKER: So somebody must
have been using Chrome tools.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.020
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yes.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.110
MALE SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.180
So you also covered something
about the difference between

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.410
latency and bandwidth, and how
developers should look at it,

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.200
how it's really important.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.680
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.240
So this is a big aha moment, I
think, for a lot of people,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.670
where you turn on your TV, you
watch the commercials for your

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.080
ISP, and it's like, get the
latest 4G, highest speed,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.070
whatever bandwidth connection,
right?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.420
And oftentimes, I think, we
think of speed and performance

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.850
on the web as just bandwidth.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.920
Like, can I get a bigger pipe,
if you will, to my house?

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.580
Because that'll solve
all problems.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.600
If we have bigger
pages, so what?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.590
We'll just get more bandwidth.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.750
The problem is, bandwidth
doesn't actually help after a

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.940
certain point with
web browsing.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.660
So as we said, we have
80 requests.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.680
We have many parallel
connections.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.300
And if you kind of go into lower
levels of how TCP works,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.380
we don't actually use all the
bandwidth at the beginning of

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.210
the TCP connection.

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.620
So you're actually
bound by latency.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.790
And unfortunately, latency
is not changing.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.640
We have this annoying thing
called the speed of light, and

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.960
it's like, we just
can't figure out

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.320
how to go any faster.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.530
So because of that, we need to
pay attention to latency.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.270
This is-- you mentioned CDNs.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.100
The whole point of a CDN is to
get a server closer to the

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.060
user, such that we
can terminate

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.390
the connection faster.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.450
That is the prime point there.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.160
And just understanding why you
need that is very important.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.240
So if you're running a site
here in Europe, and your

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.420
server is in the US, because
you're using some cloud

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.430
provider, you're penalizing
all of your users by a

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.855
significant margin-- like
150, 200 milliseconds.

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:47.340
MALE SPEAKER: And eventually
you're not making as much

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.980
money as you should be.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.290
ILYA GRIGORIK: Right, and in
all likelihood, your bounce

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.920
rates are higher, and
other things.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.390
MALE SPEAKER: So speaking of all
of this, how much of that

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.910
is going into innovation
and standards?

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.750
I mean, I hear about HTTP2
maybe coming along.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.700
Can you say a word about that,
and how maybe that was

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.860
inspired by [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.120
Google?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.370
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yeah.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.480
So actually, one of the efforts
that we've been

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.580
sponsoring at Google and working
very closely with is

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.390
the W3C web performance group.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.860
So this is a group that was
started a couple years ago,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.120
and it has already created a
number of standards, like

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.040
navigation timing.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.810
Navigation timing allows you
to get instrumentation data

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.290
out of the browser for things
like, so how long did that DNS

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.780
lookup take?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.470
You couldn't access this data
maybe even a year ago.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.170
So we have this now, and
you mentioned HTTP2.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.900
So that was also in some
part driven by SPDY.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.740
So this is a kind of
experimental protocol we

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.280
deployed at Google, and it's
available in Chrome, Firefox

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.160
and Opera now.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.390
MALE SPEAKER: Is it fair
to say that it's

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.950
used in most services?

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.930
So if you're using the Chrome
browser, and you access a

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.800
Google service, it's
actually--

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.080
ILYA GRIGORIK: Yep.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.810
So Google servers speak SPDY.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.060
Chrome speaks SPDY.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.410
So if you're accessing our
service-- if you're reading

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.370
Gmail, or doing Google searches
via HTTPS, you're

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.150
running over SPDY.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.630
You're not running over HTTP.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.170
Now, here's a caveat.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.780
SPDY is not a replacement
for HTTP.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.570
HTTP is still the same,
but we kind of

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.060
changed one layer below--

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.330
basically, how we send the
messages on the wire.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.960
And by virtue of changing that,
we can actually make the

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.090
transport more efficient, so it
can push multiple resources

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.470
over the same connection.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.590
So the HTTP 2.0 effort is
basically that, or at least,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.090
we have a charter now for that
working group-- the IETF

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.470
working group-- which is going
to take SPDY version two of

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.340
the protocol that we designed,
and use that

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.490
as a starting point.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.490
So in the coming year or couple
of years, hopefully

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.980
we'll standardize it and
release it as HTTP 2.0.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.320
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.690
Great.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.150
That's exciting to hear.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.350
ILYA GRIGORIK: And the world
will be a better place.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:47.010
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.400
That's what we all aim for.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.630
Let me close with a
final question.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.240
What about mobile in
this whole picture?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.350
That's probably someplace
where performance is as

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.890
important, if not more important
than desktops and

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:00.840
typical browsers.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.880
You have also browsers there,
and tools are actually

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.610
available to help
you with that.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.480
So what are we doing there?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.480
ILYA GRIGORIK: So everything we
just talked about applies

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.270
to mobile, especially bandwidth
and latency.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.280
So of course we still have room
for improvement in terms

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.550
of bandwidth and mobile.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.050
Having said that, latency is
much worse than desktop, for a

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.270
number of reasons which we
won't get into here.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.450
But it only makes it more
important that we design with

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.670
efficiency in mind, like
reusing connections,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.750
leveraging all of the caches,
and all the rest.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.990
We also are building--

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.720
I think we are building, but
we still need a lot better

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.610
tools for mobile.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.850
So for example, in Chrome, we
have remote debugging, and

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.390
this is very important, not just
because you can connect

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.950
to your phone and kind of pull
the data out of it, but you

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.730
can actually simulate and use
the wireless network on your

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.050
phone to feel how the page
looks, or how it downloads, if

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.620
you will, or even
how it executes.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.140
We develop our mobile
apps on our desktop.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.940
We run it in an emulator, which
is still running on your

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.730
beefy quad-core with whatever
graphics card.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.900
Then you put it on your little
phone, right, and it's still

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.810
underpowered, comparatively
speaking.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.530
These things are getting very
good in terms of computing

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.940
power and all the rest, but
nonetheless, orders of

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:14.960
magnitude less.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.170
And then it just feels very
different, right?

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.520
So with Chrome dev tools, you
can now use all the same

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.180
tooling to debug on your phone,
which is awesome.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.390
I think we still have more room
for improvement, though.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.340
MALE SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.600
So looking forward to those
improvements as well.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.870
Thanks for taking the time.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.120
ILYA GRIGORIK: Thank you.
