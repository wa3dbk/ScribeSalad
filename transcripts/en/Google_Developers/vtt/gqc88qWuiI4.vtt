CHELSEA DERRICK: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.500
Welcome to True Grit, Debugging
CSS and Render

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.510
Performance.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.590
My name is Chelsea Derrick and
I'm a Software Engineer at

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.320
Google on the Gmail Team.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm going to kick
us off with an

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.740
incredibly provocative statement.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.880
Fast is better than flow.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.520
This is actually a part of
Google's 10 Things, which is

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.560
our corporate philosophy.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.170
And it's Number Three on that
list, and we put it there

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050
explicitly because we don't
get speed for free.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.200
We have to spend a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears to get

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.070
our apps to go quickly.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.670
And when we're talking about
web applications in

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.930
particular, there's just a
lot of room to optimize.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.610
We start out trying to minimize
the number of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.070
redirects, get the user to the
landing page immediately, make

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.600
sure that when they log in,
it's a quick and easy

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.180
experience.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.800
Then--

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610
this is near and dear to my
heart on the Gmail team--

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.330
any sort of data look we have
to do on the back end, get

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.790
emails, get docs, get posts,
anything like that.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.800
Network delay.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.500
I've often suggested that Google
take some of that money

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.880
out of the bank and just move
all of our users a little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.220
closer to the data center.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.190
Not generally something that we
can do, however, we can try

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.910
to reduce the number of bytes
we send across the wire.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.130
That'll speed up our
page a little bit.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.100
And then as we're getting
closer and closer to the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
client, we start worrying about
things like JavaScript

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.320
execution, and finally,
rendering.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.270
This is what we're here
to talk about today.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.070
And in particular, especially
given that I work on a product

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.170
where sometimes, it takes five,
ten seconds for an email

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.790
to load, it can be very tempting
to spend all of our

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.130
time worrying about
back end latency.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.960
However, that just isn't
quite good enough.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.230
So even though we're
talking about much

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.040
smaller periods of time--

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.540
often milliseconds when we're
talking about rendering--

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.410
we can't look at that as just
a drop in the bucket.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.750
That time is really, really
important to our users.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.480
So in particular, I've got a
quick little demo here for you

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.970
guys to show exactly
how important it is

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.750
to have fast rendering.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.070
So I've got the slow version
of this turned on.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.870
Unfortunately, apps don't
come with these links.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.580
But you can see that
my scrolling here

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.750
is incredibly choppy.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.160
I put an empty for loop in here
to demonstrate my point,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.370
but there are few things on
this earth that are more

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.690
irritating than choppy
scrolling, right?

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.240
If we were to compare that, for
example, to a nice, smooth

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.270
scrolling, the user's going to
get a much better experience.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.640
So again, we're only talking
about a delay of a few

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.250
milliseconds sometimes, but
it really does have a very

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.640
profound impact on our
user's experiences.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.820
So part of that is going to be
freeing up the UI thread.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820
Browser UIs you run in a single
thread, so we have to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.460
share that between rendering
and JavaScript.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.150
But just making sure we've got
really efficient, performant

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210
JavaScript is not enough.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.720
So I'm going to take us a level
past that, assume that

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.710
we've already made that
optimization.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.480
What can we do to make
our pages quick?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.960
So traditionally, the way that
I've done this in the past, I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.630
will start commenting out
sections of JavaScript and see

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.910
which one I add back
in makes it faster.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.850
This is irritating, even more
irritating when you have to do

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.280
this with your CSS.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.300
Is it the box shadow that's
slowing me down?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.610
Is it the rounded corners?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.960
This is not the best way
to approach things.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.180
It can get pretty irritating.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.500
Fortunately, there are a number
of tools available,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.150
particularly in Chrome today.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.670
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about some Chrome Dev

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.300
Tools today.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.960
In particular, there are various
profilers available

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.190
for JavaScript and for CSS.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.490
And the one that I'm really
going to focus on today is the

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.780
Chrome Timeline.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.760
This is a quick little
screenshot, and we can

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.280
basically tell the browser to
start recording what we do,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.200
and it will give us information
about where its

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.330
time is being spent.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.800
And in particular, we're going
to worry about the things that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.090
are associated with
rendering today.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.390
So there are going to be a few
different annotations we'll

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.410
see in the Timeline that
indicate a problem with our

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.230
rendering pipeline.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.649
The first one will be
Style Recalculation.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.050
We'll talk a bit about what each
of these mean shortly.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.540
Layout, I'm sure we're all
familiar with that one.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.120
Avoid Layouts.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.760
And lastly, Painting.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.290
So I do want to show really
quickly what this would look

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.210
like, and I'll zoom in a bit so
that hopefully those of you

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.830
in the back can see.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.210
Here we've got the Chrome
Timeline, and I'm just going

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.990
to go ahead and record
what happens when

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.030
I click this button.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.990
It's going to add a little bit
of margin on there, so we'll

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.140
see all of these things occur.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.860
So I'm going to go ahead and hit
Record, and then I'll head

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.620
up here, click on the button,
and then stop recording.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.020
So Chrome has given us
a few little frames

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.870
that we can look at.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.290
Let's see here.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.480
And in particular, we see
all of these steps.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.800
We see a style recalculation
occurring.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.840
And if I zoom back a little bit

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.270
further, we'll see a layout--

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.680
apologies--

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.540
a layout right here.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.480
We notice that the whole
screen turns blue.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.860
This is the browser telling us
Layouts are the worst thing

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.230
that has ever happened.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.600
And then there's a series of
paints, and actually if I

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.920
hover over those, Chrome is
going to show me exactly how

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.880
big of a rectangle
got painted.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.350
These are just the hovers on
the button, but when I

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.190
actually added the margin, it
affected everything below it

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.590
on the page as well because
margin is part of the box

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.360
model, so it pushed
other things down.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.740
So that's just a quick look at
the tool itself, which is

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.080
really helpful, but even more
useful is knowing exactly what

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.870
causes periods of time
to be spent in

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.630
those different phases.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.580
So what I'd like to spend the
majority of this talk doing is

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.710
explaining a little bit about
the rendering cycle.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.600
So we have information about
the Timeline, but we don't

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.080
really have any information
about what caused particular

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.100
chunks of time to go missing.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.670
And so by understanding a
little bit about how the

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.880
rendering cycle is implemented
in browsers, we can have a

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.760
more clear understanding of
maybe what caused a layout or

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.100
what caused a paint to occur.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.370
So first of all, any edit that
we make to the document is

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.210
going to cause the rendering
cycle to be entered, and here

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:32.650
are the steps that we're going
to be working with--

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.680
updating the DOM itself,
calculating CSS property

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.320
values, building the rendering
tree, and then using that to

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.960
perform layout calculations.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.400
And then there are two more
steps at the end, which are

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.640
paint and compositing.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.960
So let's look at each one of
these in a bit more detail.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.110
So first of all, the DOM is
basically an API that provides

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.180
access to HTML documents.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.600
The browser parses this and
provides us with a tree of

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.485
objects that we can manipulate
with JavaScript.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.640
Now, this is the first
step for a reason.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.280
Everything else in the whole
rendering cycle depends on

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.990
this being accurate.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.560
So when we, for example, add a
child or change a class name,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.680
the first thing that has to
happen is we have to actually

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.320
edit the DOM.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.670
This may be familiar to you if
you have used the Dev Tools

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.160
Element Inspector.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.290
We'll see a tree representation
of our

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.440
document, and that's actually
going to be

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.610
reflecting the DOM itself.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.190
And here's a little snippet of
JavaScript with some examples

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.410
of things we might do to
cause the browser to

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.100
have to edit the DOM.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.100
We might set the inner text or
inner HTML, we might add or

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.740
remove children, or we might
even just change the

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.270
attributes on an element.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.700
Any of these things are going to
cause the browser to enter

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.080
the rendering cycle and
go to step number one.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.010
The next thing that the browser
does, once it's got an

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.850
accurate snap of the DOM, is
it's going to calculate CSS

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.580
property values.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.350
So that means for every single
element on the page, the

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.750
browser has to have a value for
every single CSS property.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.340
Depending on what kind of
element you're looking at,

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.570
this is often upwards of 200
different properties.

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.130
So we can kind of get a glimpse
of all the work that

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.470
the browser is doing.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.520
In the Chrome Inspector, if we
take a look at this Computed

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.620
Style Zippy, we can see that
there are just a ton of

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.720
properties here.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.260
Fortunately, browsers today are
fast, but it's still an

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.580
amount of work that has to be
done before we can actually

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.669
make updates.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.920
So here's an example of just a
menu toggle button that we

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.840
might have in our HTML and
then some CSS that

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.570
goes along with it.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.400
We've got Hover Selector.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.800
We might behave a little bit
differently when the menu is

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.410
open versus closed.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.410
Same thing if we've disabled
the Menu button.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.320
And going on a little bit
further, we see some

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.060
JavaScript that's going to cause
style recalculations.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.710
So if we set that Disabled
Attribute to be true, the

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.760
browser is actually going to
have to start recalculating

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.570
styles again because
we can put HTML

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.253
attributes in our CSS selectors.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.865
And here, I've highlighted the
key things that will cause

00:09:20.865 --> 00:09:22.730
style recalculation.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:28.660
Things like pseudo classes, such
as Hover or Active, can

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.880
actually also cause a
style recalculation.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.570
The browser had to go, through
find new matches for all of

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.520
our properties, and potentially
change the value

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.060
for various CSS properties.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.490
Once we've got all of our CSS in
place, we're going to start

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.820
getting into the
layout portion.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.980
And the first step of that
is building a new tree.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.380
We already have the DOM,
however, the rendering tree is

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.660
sort of an internal data
structure that the browser

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.100
uses to perform layout tasks.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.400
It might be shaped differently
than the DOM and it might

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.030
contain different things.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.320
So here are some examples.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.070
In the DOM, we're always going
to have elements and nodes.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.780
These are the entries that we
see in the DOM, and that's

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.710
contrasted with the rendering
tree where we see boxes.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.750
Those are things that are
actually painted on the page.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.770
And in terms of the shape of
the rendering tree, we

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.700
actually have a different
parenting strategy.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.510
It's not necessarily the case
that a DOM parent is going to

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.840
be the parent in the
rendering tree.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.390
So first, let's talk
a little bit about

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.930
elements versus boxes.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.200
They're related, but they're
not the same.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.620
So a box is going to be any
entity that gets rendered on

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.690
the page, whereas an element is
just going to be an entry

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.180
in the DOM.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.740
So here's some examples of
elements that might never be

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.040
rendered on the page.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.950
Things that are displayed
None will not be in

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.210
the rendering tree.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.830
Style tags, script tags,
the head tag--

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.090
any of those things are elements
but not boxes.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.170
Similarly, there are lots of
generated boxes that we do not

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.260
have access to in the DOM.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.000
Examples include any pseudo
elements that we've added to

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.270
our CSS, line boxes.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.440
If we've got a large paragraph
of text with many lines, the

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.410
browser is laying those
out in boxes.

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.200
And any other generate a box,
like an anonymous box.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.460
These are all going to
be painted but not

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.420
present in the DOM.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.220
And then there's a good deal
of overlap in the middle--

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.560
Divs, Anchors, things
that are painted

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.810
that are also elements.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.060
So in addition to the fact that
we might have different

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.430
content inside of these
trees, they can also

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.570
have a different shape.

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:43.170
So a parent in the DOM tree is
always going to be the parent

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.560
in the HTML.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.010
However, the parent in the
rendering tree is always going

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.340
to be a boxes containing
block.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.840
And if you ever decide that
you just need some fun on

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.770
Friday night and you read the
CSS spec, you'll see lots of

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.720
references to the containing
block when you are reading the

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.980
layout module.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.860
And in general, we actually do
see a lot of correlation

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.940
between the DOM tree and the
rendering tree, but there are

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.860
some notable exceptions.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.640
Absolutely positioned boxes
are the most obvious one.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.570
So whenever we're looking for a
rendering tree parent for an

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:19.470
absolute box, the browser's
actually walking up the DOM

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.870
looking for a positioned
ancestor.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.900
So this is going to be some
other parent in the tree--

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.490
or an ancestor, rather--

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.470
that has a position property
other than static.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.020
This will be the parent
in the rendering tree.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.270
So I've got a bit of an example
on the next page.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.360
So there's a bit of HTML here,
and I'm going to show you the

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.370
differences between the DOM tree
and the rendering tree.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.660
So as we're parsing along with
our HTML, we notice we've got

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.150
this section element.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.480
It has a Div child.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400
That Div child itself
has got a text node.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.940
It's got this Nav element,
which has a text

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.280
node itself, et cetera.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.330
We can keep on parsing
all the way down.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.240
This is the structure
we expect.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.340
We put in valid HTML, we
got a tree back that

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.950
looked exactly the same.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:16.160
Now if we were to go back and
build the rendering tree from

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.466
the same piece of HTML,
it's going to look

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:19.880
a little bit different.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.370
So our root element
is the same.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.960
It's just going to
be a block box.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.340
And we are definitely going
to have that Div as its

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.690
descendant.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.320
However, something a little bit
different starts to happen

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.470
when we reach that absolutely
positioned Nav element.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.740
This is actually going to become
a sibling of that Div

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.500
because this section is
positioned relative, so that

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.850
Nav is going to be parented
under that section element.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.640
We also notice that we start
getting some anonymous boxes

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.500
that the browser generates
for us.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.460
This is because any given box
in the tree wants to have

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.680
homogeneous children.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.180
So soon as a particular box has
a block child, it wants

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.530
all block children.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.710
As soon as it has an
inline child, it

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.050
wants all inline children.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.590
So the browser is going to do
whatever it has to to meet

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.940
that constraint.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.330
And when we finish, there's a
tree that is certainly shaped

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.030
differently but is in a really
good position to perform

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.430
layout tasks.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.460
So this is all setting us up to
do a layout pass later on.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.590
We've already decided what
everyone's containing block

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.530
is, so we know its containing
width, all

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:27.780
those kinds of things.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.110
Let's talk a little bit about
the properties that are going

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.250
to affect the rendering tree.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.480
The first one is going to
be the display property.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.240
Is this a block or
an inline box?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.770
Is it Display None, in which
case it's not even in the

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.600
rendering tree at all?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.420
Is it a float?

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.570
Is it position fixed, position
absolute, position relative,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.500
or position static?

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.770
Any edits that we make to these
properties are going to

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.920
cause the browser to have to
make some kind of change to

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.170
the rendering tree.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.860
There also some affects on
layers, which we'll talk about

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.550
a bit later on.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.490
But in general, the rendering
tree, again, has set us up to

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.450
do a layout pass.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.510
And when we talk about layout,
all we really mean is that we

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.380
have to determine the position
and dimensions of every box.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.270
How tall is it, how wide is it,
and where is its top left

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.830
corner, in most cases.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.750
So the kinds of properties we're
talking about here is

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.640
going to be anything to do
with the box model, so

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:38.410
content, padding, border,
margin, and any coordinates.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.230
So if we've got an absolutely
positioned box, for example,

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.230
the top, right, bottom,
and left properties.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.900
So you'll notice that there is
sometimes a different set of

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.090
properties for these
two different parts

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.340
of the layout phase.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.350
Now at this point, the browser
has determined where

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.220
everything needs to go but
hasn't actually shown these

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.290
changes to the user.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.030
So the next thing that
to happen is paint.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.910
And a few things happen opaquely
to us as developers,

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.720
but in the end, the browser
has a couple of tasks.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.970
One, it has to determine, what
color does every pixel on the

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.850
page need to be painted?

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.060
It needs to actually create
a bitmap that has that

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.550
information, and then it needs
to send that to the GPU so

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.320
that it can actually be
presented to the user.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.900
Now, a given pixel can only
have one particular color.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.320
So as you might expect, we can
incur some extra costs here if

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.850
we have any transparency.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.490
We can't stop at
the top layer.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.740
We have to keep looking
underneath it to calculate

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.410
exactly what color to
paint this pixel.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.270
You can get especially slow if
we're talking about anything

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.180
that has text because text is
anti-aliased and there are

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.575
lots of little transparent
pixels around every letter.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.250
So one other thing to note
is the browser doesn't

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.060
necessarily have
one big bitmap.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.630
When we were looking at the
timeline earlier on, you saw

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.089
small rectangles that were being
updated rather than the

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:08.520
whole thing at once.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.740
And so there are a number of
strategies the browser uses to

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.410
pick small damaged rectangles,
and one of those is it can

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.890
have several different layers.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.560
So we can actually tell
the browser how to

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.349
slice the page up.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:24.040
I know that all these things
are likely to stay together

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.810
relative to each other, so keep
all these in one layer.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.930
And then it would be the GPU's
job to put all of those

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.770
together in the next step.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.540
I do want to point out that
although browser vendors tend

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.770
to be going towards this layer
strategy, it's not specified

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.350
behavior anywhere.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.740
So it is an implementation
detail, one that we certainly

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.700
want to take advantage of when
we're trying to get a really

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.610
fast experience, but also one
that we can't say will still

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.200
be there in a couple of years.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.720
Hopefully, we won't have to
worry about it anymore.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.670
So we've got a bunch of bitmaps
that's been handed

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:04.500
over to us, and we need to
composite them together.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.110
So all these layer bitmaps are
handed over to the GPU.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.550
The GPU sticks them all together
and then draws those

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.910
things on the screen.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.770
Now, anywhere we see some sort
of hand-off from the CPU to

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:20.080
the GPU to the actual render,
those are all going to incur

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.140
some sort of cost because we're
transferring this object

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.770
around in memory, so that's
something to keep in mind.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.410
But something else to note is
that the GPU, it turns out, is

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.650
very fast at drawing things.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.020
This make sense.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.640
The first G is for graphics.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.580
So it's much better for us
to spend as much time in

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.880
compositing rather
than painting

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.130
if we have the choice.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.540
So properties that the
compositor is really good at

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.275
are going to be opacity.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.370
If we're just doing some sort
of transition or something

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.460
that just changes opacity, the
GPU can do this all on its

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.160
own, and same thing
with transforms.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.880
So that's going to be anything
like a rotation, a skew, a

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.740
translation, any of those things
that move a particular

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.010
element around the screen.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.610
Transform is very--

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.090
well, I think it's
very interesting.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.790
You may or may not.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.340
We can move things around the
page without actually

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.100
affecting layout.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.740
So typically, when we move
things around the page, we're

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.810
using the position relative
and we change the left

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.280
property, or we'll add some
margin, something like that,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.910
but all those are taking us
back to the layout step.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.850
However, if we're relying just
on transformation to do that,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.630
this element is totally
out of the flow.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.750
The layout engine, the rendering
tree still thinks

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.790
it's in the original location,
so it's not dirtying up

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.760
anything else anywhere
on the page.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.360
Now, this also has the side
effect that it's not pushing

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.530
anything out of its way, so
maybe you have to move other

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.000
things as well.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.990
But to get certain kinds of
effects, this can be a very

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.660
handy thing to know.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.930
So if we look back over the
rendering cycle that we've

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.300
just discussed, we can see
that there is definitely

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.140
alignment with the things
the Timeline tells us.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:09.605
So in terms of updating the
DOM and doing our style

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:12.390
recalc, those are all going
to fall under the Style

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.590
Recalculation that we saw.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.860
And then we've got all
of this layout work.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.400
We have to make any updates to
the rendering tree, and then

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.410
actually calculate the layout.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.820
And then at the very end, we've
got a painting step and

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.380
then compositing layers, which
I did not show you yet, but I

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.390
will in just a moment.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.590
So at this point, we're armed
with enough knowledge to maybe

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.280
look at the Timeline and reverse
engineer, OK, a layout

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.370
occurred here.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.820
I don't want one.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.880
What other strategy could
I have used for

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.580
that particular effect?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.070
And we can try to remove
layouts, eliminate style

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.950
recalculations, that
sort of thing.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.070
So I apologize because I'm going
to be hiding behind my

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:00.820
computer a bit, but I have a
short demo app that I'm going

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.300
to show various snaps of
the Timeline from.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.760
So first of all, the effect that
we're going for here is

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.810
going to be this little guy
sliding in and out, and that's

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.550
just a hover change.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.670
So when I hover in, it
slides in and out.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.790
And I'm going to show you what
the Timeline looks like for

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.540
various different ways we can
implement the same effect.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.910
This first one is implemented
with margin.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.310
We can see that we positioned
this element offscreen with a

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.100
margin left, and then
we bring it back in

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.350
whenever a hover occurs.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.100
So if we go ahead and fire up
our Timeline and we take a

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.720
recording, we'll see lots of
exciting things happening.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.390
And I'm going to go ahead and
zoom in here and just analyze

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.430
what the browser's had to do.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.390
So we see that there are
a number of style

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.260
recalculations.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.420
It is unfortunate that there
are several instead of just

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.670
one, but that happens
sometimes.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.150
Chrome in particular is getting
better and better at

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.720
combining these things, but we
see that we've got a bunch of

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.170
style recalcs, and then we
have a layout here, which

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.030
makes sense.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.100
Margin is a layout-related
property.

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.990
So even though it didn't push
anything else out of the way,

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.180
the rendering tree and the
dimensions of this element

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.830
actually had to be updated.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.440
As we scroll down, we continue
to see that there are a series

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.990
of recalculate style and layout,
one after the other.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.130
So the way that I have
implemented this is with a CSS

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.630
transition, and so the browser
is basically, on my behalf,

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:35.570
going through and saying, well,
the margin left was

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.610
negative 215.

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.130
Now it's negative 214,
and on, and so forth.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.940
So we'll continue to see a
number of style recalculations

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.670
as we go, and we'll also start
to see some paints.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.640
Now I scrolled a bit so my
rectangles will be in the

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.780
wrong place, but we can see
that there are little

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.630
rectangles that start peeking
in, demonstrating where a flag

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.070
comes in and out.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.230
Now, as a hat tip and also a bit
of a frustration for me,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.170
when I started working on this
talk a month ago, those

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.160
rectangles were huge and I got a
really big win when I showed

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.330
you the next version.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.340
It got faster, and so the impact
is less severe, but we

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.640
can still see as we go through
that the browser's having to

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.210
do a number of steps before
it can do a single paint.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.570
Sometimes a paint doesn't
even fit in.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.450
We'll get a recalc, a layout,
and then another recalc

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.320
without even getting a paint.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.790
So this sort of thing is going
to cause a lower frame rate

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.390
for the user.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.290
So we scroll all the way to the
end, and at some point,

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:41.380
everything finished and it
painted the entire little logo

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.070
all the way on screen.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.830
And it's not too bad.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.510
This happens to be an incredibly
lightweight page.

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:50.220
If we had a lot more elements
on the page, though, we'd

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:52.140
start getting some jerkiness
that the user

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.770
can actually see.

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:57.650
And so we've got a number of
steps that we want to go

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.160
through, and we get the biggest
wins at the beginning

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.470
of the rendering cycle.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.000
So in particular, can we
eliminate recalcs and can we

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.790
eliminate layouts?

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.010
So those are the things
that we're going to

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:09.580
try to focus on.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.750
So prior to CSS3, I would have
said to myself, you know,

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.530
margin can cause other things on
the page to move around, so

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.230
maybe I'll try to absolutely
position this flag and slide

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.920
it in and out, because then, I'm
guaranteed it's not going

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.780
to affect all those siblings
that are in the flow.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.580
So I'll go ahead and click
Position, and my

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.590
CSS is going to change.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.540
This is going to be absolutely
positioned, and I'm going to

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.900
use the left property instead
to do the animation.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.470
And I'll weasel it on screen
a little bit, take a new

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:49.510
recording, and zoom in and see
if things got any better.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.770
So I still see a number of
recalculations, and I still

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.920
see layouts.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.530
Now, these layouts are going to
be a bit quicker than the

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.460
layouts we saw with margin,
but they're still there

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.810
because when we looked at the
layout slide, left is still a

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.850
property that has to do some
sort of layout calculation.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.960
Now, it's cheaper because it
doesn't affect anything else

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.720
on the page, but it's still
going to cost us.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.760
So as we're going down, we still
see that we've got these

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.090
recalculations and layouts
interspersed

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.170
with all of our painting.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.700
And this is just not going to be
good enough, mostly because

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.410
we can do better.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.390
So that wasn't as big a win as
maybe we would have hoped.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.850
However, if we think back to
what I said about layers, it

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.160
might occur to us to try a
transformation instead.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.990
Transforms have no
effect on layout.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.570
It's a paint only concept, so
we might give that a try.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.860
So let's take a look at
the CSS we do here.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.710
We're going to use
a transformation.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.860
We're going to translate
x instead of

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.460
moving our left property.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.640
So leave the element in the
flow, but go ahead and

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.780
reposition it using
a transform.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.780
So I'll go ahead and take
a recording here.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.710
I can tell already there's a lot
more green in here, which

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.960
is exactly what I'm
looking for.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.475
So I still see a number of

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:13.180
recalculations at the beginning.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.900
Remember, hovering can cause our
CSS selectors to change.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.120
That's what actually kicked off
my transition, in fact.

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.420
But when I continue looking, I
see that there are a large

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.350
number of paints at the
beginning, but then as I go

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:33.460
through, I'm getting just a
bunch of composited layers.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.860
So these are incredibly cheap
and easy for the GPU to do,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:40.690
and so we're going to see a
much smoother transform,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.230
especially if, like I said, we
had a very heavyweight DOM

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:48.205
page that was hard for
the browser to paint.

00:26:48.205 --> 00:26:51.900
However, still at the end, we've
got this large paint

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.830
right at the end, and at the
beginning, there are a series

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.160
of pains as well.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.470
These sort of perplexed me when
I first tried this out

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.450
and I was thinking to myself,
there's nothing up there.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.370
What's happening?

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.870
But what the browser is actually
doing is it's saying,

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.780
well, you added a layer here
but in order to slide that

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.850
around, I had to put everything
else on the page in

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.620
a layer as well so that the
GPU can composite them.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:19.330
So this is that little
CSS tag that I have.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:22.100
This is the links that
are on there.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.130
This is the flag itself.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.880
And then we had to do one big
paint to the whole page to

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.090
actually render those layers.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:31.960
So for the duration of the
animation, we actually get

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.400
fairly smooth effects, but at
the beginning and at the end

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.280
we have to do a very
large paint.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.610
And since painting is less
efficient than compositing, we

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:42.980
want to try to get the smallest

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.800
rectangles that we can.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.730
So you may have heard that
Transform 3D is supposed to

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.540
accelerate things, whatever
that means.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.640
So whenever I'm working on my
own, I just sort of take that

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.480
as a given and I say, all
right, let's try that.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.510
See if it makes it faster.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.390
So let's go ahead and
take a recording.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.600
You'll see at this point I've
use Translate 3D instead.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.690
I haven't actually done anything
with the y- or the

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.010
z-axis, but I'm going to give
it a shot and just see if it

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.780
makes a change.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:18.200
Guess and check, the web
developer's best friend.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.680
So I'll go ahead and zoom in on
here, and I still see that

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.470
I've got a large number
of paints that

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.510
occur at the beginning.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:29.140
So I'm thinking to myself that
this is not good enough.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.500
What I want to do is I want to
avoid these initial paints, so

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.940
I need to actually take the
things that are present here

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.610
and I need to put them in
layers the whole time.

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.600
The problem here is that
something is getting popped

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.380
out into a layer, it's causing
all this extra

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.760
work to have to happen.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.140
So instead, if in the resting
state I put them in layers all

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.310
along, I can avoid this.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.810
So I'm going to go and do this
on the fly, hoping not to make

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.180
typos in front of all of you.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.630
But I'm going to go ahead and
say that everything will be in

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:05.330
a Translate 3D in its
resting state.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:10.950
I already have one for the
resting state of the bar, but

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.600
I don't have anything for this
list that I've got right here,

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:24.330
so I might try a Transform 3D
and say, don't go anywhere.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:26.340
Just sit there.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.480
And then I might do the same
thing with this code block

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.730
right here.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:41.760
So my hypothesis is things are
in layers right now, so as

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.970
soon as I made that change, we
had to paint each of those

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.260
individually to pop them
out into layers.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.450
But now, it shouldn't cause a
hitch at the beginning or the

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.410
end of my animation.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.280
They're already in layers.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.340
We don't have to do that work.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:59.320
So let's give that a shot,
see how accurate it is.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.580
I do see one here.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.020
I apparently missed somebody
somewhere on the page.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.820
But my giant paints that
I had before--

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.950
apologies--

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.610
no paints, right?

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.680
So I completely eliminated
paint as

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.460
associated with this layer.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.710
Now obviously, when I introduce
the layer, that

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.340
caused a paint, but now I've
taken it out of the places

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.370
where I care about smoothness,
which is the

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.620
duration of my animation.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.480
So that was the demo, so let's
head back and get a high level

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.790
view of the kinds of
things that we want

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.440
to try to do here.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.820
So the first and foremost is
we have to get rid of any

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.240
JavaScript interruptions
that we have.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.100
If an animation or scrolling is
occurring, we want to make

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.240
sure that we're not getting
random JavaScript callbacks,

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.540
we're not doing expensive
JavaScript in the middle of

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.790
our animation.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.670
Sometimes, maybe you're
implementing something like a

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.790
sticky header, you can't avoid
it, but you want to keep it as

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:58.860
lightweight as possible because
any time that we're

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.420
spending on our JavaScript
is taking

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.780
away time from painting.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.800
So that's the first one.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.300
The next one is we want
to get rid of as

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.250
many layouts as possible.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.490
Now, we can't always avoid
a layout occurring.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.020
In fact, not only writing to the
DOM causes a layout, but

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.830
sometimes reading from the DOM
causes a layout as well.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.000
So the browser will try to batch
up a series of writes to

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.440
the DOM, and if we've
interleaved a bunch of reads

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.210
in there, it has to validate the
whole thing before it can

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.950
give you an accurate answer.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:33.240
So for example, if you are
measuring the width of

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.630
something and then you write
to the height of something

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.990
else and then you get the
offset top of something,

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.510
that's going to cause a lot more
layouts instead of the

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.410
browser being able to
batch them all up.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.170
So even if we can't fully
eliminate them, we want to get

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.230
as few layouts as possible.

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:50.930
And then moving on from there,
we went to minimize our paint

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.650
rectangles.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.486
We can't always avoid having
these rectangles, but we want

00:31:55.486 --> 00:31:57.170
to get them as small
as possible.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.890
So small in number, small
in size on our paints.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.260
And then if we can, we want to
try to eliminate painting

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.150
altogether.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.770
Now again, this whole layer
concept is not anywhere in any

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.890
sort of standardized
specification.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.130
It's just one of those things
that we have to do if we want

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.490
a great experience for
our users these days.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.350
I will say that a question I
often get is, well, why don't

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.230
we just put everything into a
layer and then we don't have

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.910
to worry about it?

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.660
It does take up some amount of
vRAM, and if you put every

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.850
element in the page on a layer,
at that point, there's

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.710
so much memory being taken up
and so much work to combine

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.510
them all together that you get
very diminishing returns,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:39.770
especially on a very low power
device like a phone.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.080
And so we have to be a little
bit thoughtful.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.770
We have to choose our layers,
carve up our page in a way

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.900
that will actually support
whatever particular effect

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.900
we're trying to get.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.600
So these are our takeaways
from this session.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.120
And if we're trying to improve
our rendering time, we want to

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.710
start at the top and
go to the bottom.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:00.040
We'll get the biggest win by
getting rid of our JavaScript

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.230
and so on down the page.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.290
There are some links on here,
and I will also have a link to

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:08.280
this slide show, but
there are a ton of

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.540
great resources available.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.070
The Chrome Team has been
wonderful about posting things

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:16.960
to the HTML5 Rocks website,
so I definitely highly

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.300
recommend that one.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.610
And there are some links on here
that I've found useful.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.740
The last one explains all kinds
of things about the

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:26.320
threading architecture for the
Chrome renderer, so settle in

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.731
on that one, but it's definitely
a great read.

00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:32.150
And with that, we're going to
go ahead and take questions.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.110
This link is to the slideshow,
so if you'd like to revisit

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.510
and click on those links, this
is where you can go.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.080
Thank you.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:47.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.440
CHELSEA DERRICK: And if there
are any questions, there are a

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:49.210
couple microphones.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.460
There's one here
in the middle.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.510
Not sure if this is the most
appropriate forum for this

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.270
question, but I've always
wondered why every value of

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:12.969
position triggers a layout when
most of them don't really

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:13.880
affect layout that much.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.449
Like position absolute elements
don't affect layout

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.199
at all, they're taken
out of the flow.

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:23.850
Position relative elements,
they seem to behave quite

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.429
similarly to an element that
has been translated using

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:26.804
transforms.

00:34:26.804 --> 00:34:30.170
And of course, fixed elements
are in their own world.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.560
So why do these trigger
a layout?

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:32.810
CHELSEA DERRICK: Yes.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:35.239
That's a great question, and
definitely one of the places

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.320
that browsers have
a long way to go.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.270
We shouldn't have to
think about this.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.730
If I don't have any children and
I'm just a square on the

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.860
page and you move my left edge,
it shouldn't affect

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.620
anything else.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.690
Why are you wasting the time?

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:52.080
It's sort of a result of the
fact that left can sometimes

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.590
have an effect, and it's better
to waste a little time

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.820
and make sure you're 100%
accurate rather than to try to

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.830
prematurely optimize.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.370
Now, I say the web
is pretty old.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.980
It's not premature anymore.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.250
It's definitely an area for
active development, but it's

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.120
hard to do it correctly.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.420
So those are sort of tagged as
layout-related properties, and

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.160
so the layouts that they trigger
are shorter than other

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.584
layouts, but they
still happen,

00:35:16.584 --> 00:35:16.981
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:17.380
Thank you.

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.570
CHELSEA DERRICK: Sure.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:26.460
I'm wondering, how does SVG play
a role, if you know, in

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.240
all this stuff?

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.530
CHELSEA DERRICK: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.960
I myself don't have a ton
of experience with SVG.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.580
Right now, SVG, Canvas,
HTML, these are all

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.610
very divorced concepts.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:40.300
They don't share a common layer
underneath anything.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.980
There's a lot of work being
done right now.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.970
Actually, there's a Chrome team
in Google who's working

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.240
on a spec for animations that
will have a common layer

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.840
underneath all of these
things, but

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.880
we're not there yet.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.630
So they're all completely
separate code

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.990
branches at the moment.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.460
So things that are going to
work on HTML and CSS don't

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.450
necessarily work on
SVG or Canvas.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.185
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:04.185 --> 00:36:05.230
CHELSEA DERRICK: All right.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.470
We'll see if anyone happened to
be live streaming and asked

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.230
me questions.

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.010
Sweet.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.910
I was kind of worried
that it was going to

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:17.080
be unmoderated content.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.460
Are there any other questions?

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:19.800
All right.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.120
Thank you so much
for attending.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.532
