COLT MCANLIS: Good.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.730
Test.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.780
Can everybody hear me?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.830
Can everyone see how bald I
am from where you're sitting?

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.200
Hands up if you can see
your reflection in my head.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.330
So I have a really
tough job tonight.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.880
My job is to try to keep
you entertained and awake

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.630
at this time of night, after
you've been fed and alcoholed.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.685
So I'm going to try to
do that as best I can.

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:29.310
Let me introduce
myself really quickly.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
My name is Colt McAnlis.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.710
I'm actually the team lead
for Chrome Developer Relations

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.690
Performance.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.910
About a year ago, in
January, we actually

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.830
identified that the web
performance community was

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.830
good and doing
well, but we didn't

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.090
have someone focused on
bringing the message to people

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.280
constantly.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.160
As talked about in the
previous talks tonight,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.796
it's really easy to do dumb,
slow things on the web.

00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:53.920
And one of the first things
we need to do with that

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.820
is fix it with education.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.500
So we kind of defined
from the beginning

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.335
that after looking
at all the education

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:01.835
and looking at
everything out there,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.739
there's really three
pillars of web performance.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550
Up until now, the web
as a whole has really

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.920
only focused on one of them.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.040
All you've heard from
most performance experts

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280
is, how fast does
your website load.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.780
We've all seen the
studies that show

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.870
that one millisecond of time
actually related to $10 million

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.400
of lost revenue for
site X, Y, and Z.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
And they only really
talk about network.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.630
But in the modern age
of web applications,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.590
we often tend to
neglect the other two

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.540
pillars of web performance,
rendering and compute.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.429
A great part of the
forecast-- Forecastio?

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.812
Forecast-- I wanted to see.

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:38.520
He was listening.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.120
That was good.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.828
I wanted to test.

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:41.479
See, I've got to
keep you awake, too.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.770
One of the great parts of
the forecast talk, I believe,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.781
was when he really said,
we have to actually solve

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.280
this problem of
rendering because it

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
doesn't happen for free.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.292
I think the existence of
the previous type of web,

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:54.250
where CSS animations
weren't something you even

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.020
had availability to, allowed
us to do really stupid things,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690
and the browser
kept us really fast.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.445
But now, because we kind
of can tend our own yard,

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.330
we're running into
some problems there.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.940
So when you think
about performance,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.190
you should know that
network, render,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.606
and compute-- you can have
problems in all three of these.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:13.220
And much like Jake said
earlier, a huge problem

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.880
in one of these
portions can actually

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.310
cloud out issues that are
happening in the other two.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980
So as you're going through your
process of finding performance

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.072
issues in your website,
you need to make sure

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:23.780
that you're evaluating
all three of these

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.560
with the right tools
at the right time.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.840
And what I'm going to do tonight
is I'm going to try to walk you

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.950
through some of the sites
that you've submitted--

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.390
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-- and hopefully
bruise your ego a little bit.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.124
No offense.

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:36.290
It's what we all have to do.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.620
Quite frankly, I think one
of the big things we've

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.480
been trying to do with
the web performance

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.090
movement over the past year is
actually bruise a lot of egos,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.751
in a way.

00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:45.000
Because we're all programmers.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We're all smart.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.810
We're too smart, quite frankly.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.682
And we've got to be
taken down a peg.

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:51.640
Because we all know in
here-- everyone in here,

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.759
think about your coworkers.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.550
And think about what
really motivates them.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.039
99% of the time, if you
can bruise their ego

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.330
or challenge them or tell
them they're not good enough,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.970
or the problem's
too hard, that's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.784
what actually gets
them to move, right?

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:05.990
AUDIENCE: Or if
you pay them more.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.715
COLT MCANLIS: OK, maybe, maybe.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:11.590
If you've got Yankees
money, I guess so.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.904
So this is the loop.

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.820
So this is what you
should all be thinking of.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.450
Now I've got about 10 years
of game development background

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.070
under my belt.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.557
I'm a C++ programmer at heart.

00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:21.640
And I'm trying to apply a
lot of the lessons we're

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.690
using in game development
to web development.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.430
Because in reality, we're both
dealing with real time media

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.342
interfaces.

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:29.550
So when you guys say, how
fast can something load off

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.590
an internet site, I'm
thinking, how fast

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.390
can that stuff be
streamed off a DVD.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.837
It's the same problem we've
had, just 10 years later.

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:38.420
So when you're doing
your performance,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.710
the main thing that you have to
do is follow these three steps.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.370
The first thing is you
need to gather information.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.840
You go open up Chrome DevTools.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.680
You open up WebPagetest.org.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.060
This gives you information about
what is going on in your page.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.610
From that, you
actually need insight.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.540
Because really,
what's a whole sheet

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.360
of floating point
numbers mean to you?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.960
Nothing.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.950
You need to know what those
floating point numbers mean.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.070
And your tooling
system needs to be

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.480
able to infer what those
floating point numbers mean.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.980
And then once you
have that insight,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.580
you need to be able to
actually plan an action.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.320
You have this data.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.778
You have to then
go to your manager

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:10.370
and justify, please, let
me spend two weeks fixing

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.270
seven milliseconds of
load time from our website

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.140
because it matters.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.110
And then you need to be able
to repeat this constantly,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.068
constantly, constantly.

00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:18.790
You need continuous
integration tools.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.070
You need the ability to actually
track down who's check-in

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.437
broke the build.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:25.270
Quick show of hands.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.500
How many of you in
here actually have

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.291
some continuous
integration for performance

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.350
in your suite right now?

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.940
One, two, three, four, five.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.440
Wait.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.600
Were you just showing
me your Pepsi can?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.000
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.300
It's a cool can.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.400
Bravo?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.820
So maybe four, maybe five,
out of an entire room.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.379
I've asked this question to
probably about 3,000 developers

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.920
this week while I've
been in New York

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.610
and meeting and giving talks,
and the total number of people

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.270
is close to about 15, with
the five in this room.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.020
This shows there's a huge
problem in the web community

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.490
is that we're not actually
testing for performance

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.750
and giving it the gravitas that
we are our features and our CSS

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.250
and those pretty
little bubbly items

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.160
everywhere else on our pages.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.140
And this is why we
actually moved forward

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.270
with trying to build a
better community about this.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.630
So for you in the audience,
this is the only slide

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.088
I want you to take
away from today.

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:15.610
Burn this into your retina.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.110
Tweet it.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.830
Blog it.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.649
Get a tattoo of it.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.940
Get it tattooed, tweet me,
and I'll send you some swag.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.240
Please don't get a tattoo.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.740
Anything I say is
not representative

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.330
of any organization or
Google or the lawyers that

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.480
are affiliated with me.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.890
All comments are my own.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.036
Please do not get a tattoo.

00:05:30.036 --> 00:05:31.660
First off, if you're
doing performance,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.590
go to HTML5Rocks.com.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.651
There's a landing page.

00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:35.650
It's called Performance.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.720
You click on the button.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.490
I'm actually the guy
that maintains that page.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.240
If you start there,
it's going to walk you

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.114
through the three pillars
of web performance.

00:05:43.114 --> 00:05:45.500
You're going to be able
to go step by step on how

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.280
to find and address
the largest problems

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.890
on each one of
these three pillars.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.660
Next is you need to
be following and using

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.300
the #perfmatters hashtag.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.220
We actually started this
hashtag just earlier this year.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.660
And we really wanted
to use #webperf.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.280
We really did.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.530
We wanted to use that hashtag.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.238
It was out there.

00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:04.520
But we didn't feel like
it bruised enough egos.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.610
We wanted #perfmatters to
be this name, this brand,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.345
this answer to a question.

00:06:09.345 --> 00:06:11.220
And what we saw was that
very quickly, people

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.830
started posting links to
their friends' websites

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.060
and being like, yo, dude.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.451
Why does it take 15 seconds to
load your site? #perfmatters.

00:06:18.451 --> 00:06:18.950
Right?

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.408
We wanted it to be something
you could take to your manager

00:06:21.408 --> 00:06:22.990
and say, hey, it
takes 15 seconds

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.430
for our site to load on mobile.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.910
#perfmatters.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.680
We want this to be a badge.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.600
We are all egotistical
programmers.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.970
Wear the badge.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.350
Own the sticker.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.692
Make it a part of your culture.

00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:36.150
Make it a part of
your environment.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.983
That's what we want.

00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:37.920
We want attitude.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.670
That's why you should
follow that hashtag.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.606
Finally, check out the G+
Web Performance community,

00:06:42.606 --> 00:06:43.480
if you're in Google+.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.260
It's a cool place.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.760
A lot of cool people
hang out there.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.660
Some of them are bald.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.743
Some of them post content.

00:06:47.743 --> 00:06:49.215
I'm not saying who.

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:52.070
But you need to follow that
because really, if you combine

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.427
#perfmatters with the Google
Web Performance communities

00:06:54.427 --> 00:06:56.260
and the articles coming
through HTML5 Rocks,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.000
you're actually going to find
an overflow of information.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.120
I bet most of you in
here haven't actually

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.880
dived into-- here,
we'll do this.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.620
We'll do this.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.680
Put your hand up if you've
read more than five articles

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.680
about performance.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.360
OK.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.880
Keep your hands up.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.671
Keep your hands up.

00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:14.410
More than 10 articles.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.910
OK.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.248
Let's ramp this exponentially.

00:07:16.248 --> 00:07:16.747
20.

00:07:19.946 --> 00:07:22.256
28.

00:07:22.256 --> 00:07:23.192
Ah.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:26.510
Let's go 40 articles
on performance.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.040
OK.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.956
For those of you who
have had your hands up,

00:07:29.956 --> 00:07:31.580
of those 40 articles,
how many of those

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.621
things did you implement?

00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.000
Maybe 5, 6, 20?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.180
No fair if you actually
did a talk earlier tonight.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.510
I'm not taking your input.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.540
So the point that we're
getting at, though,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.180
is that for those of you
who haven't been reading

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.330
a lot of this content,
this is actually

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.480
going to be an overflow
of information.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.355
Hopefully, you can find
it, you can guide it,

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:47.477
you can move through it.

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:48.310
What's the next one?

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.670
Yeah.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.086
So what I'm going to do now
is with the rest of the time--

00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:52.760
Pete, how much time do we have?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.510
40, 60?

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.260
As much as I want.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.550
Keep talking until
people fall asleep.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.050
Good.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.300
I can do that.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.650
So what we're going to do
is I'm actually only going

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.480
to load these
websites on mobile.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.830
Quite frankly, I ran
through these earlier today.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.149
And most of your sites actually
fell over dead on mobile.

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:09.190
There were some interesting
use cases on desktop,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.047
but quite frankly,
desktop's dead.

00:08:11.047 --> 00:08:13.130
If you're not making your
site mobile and friendly

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.420
and fast there, you're
doing it wrong, period.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.440
Period, period, period.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.920
Mobile is all that matters
right now-- #perfmatters.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.810
You can tweet that.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.285
I'll give you a second.

00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:23.030
No, go ahead.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:23.920
It's OK.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.640
#perfmatters, [INAUDIBLE], OK.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.306
So we're going to take a look at
a couple of these really quick.

00:08:28.306 --> 00:08:31.410
And I'm going to try to organize
these in terms of discussion

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.820
and pointing out
a couple things.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.850
So if we don't get to
all of them, I apologize.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.079
Please feel free to email
me later and curse at me.

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:38.120
Or do it on social media.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.194
That's always fun too.

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:40.860
So what I've got here
is a little setup,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.760
and you can actually
see my little phone,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.000
so I can click on some stuff.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.640
And what I'm using over here is
the Chrome Developer Tools ADB

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.530
extension.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.030
So this is a fantastic
little-- who's using this?

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.770
Anyone using this?

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.400
No?

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.220
No fair if you're
hosting the event, dude.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.290
You guys are cheating.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.080
So this is a fantastic
Chrome extension.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.190
You go to the Chrome Web Store.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.040
You can actually download
and install this extension.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.498
Basically, what it
allows you to do

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:05.400
is interface with the
Android Developer Tools

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.730
very easily and quickly.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.370
So I can actually click on this
and go View inspection targets,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:13.170
and you'll actually see that it
loads and shows me this Galaxy

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.329
Nexus phone that's actually
plugged in right here.

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:16.870
And I can actually
click-- well, I'll

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.330
close this so you can actually
see what this looks like.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.370
I can click the Inspect button.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.710
And what this Inspect
button shows is

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.020
it actually shows me what's
on my phone right now.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.930
So this is one of the
sites, and I'll get to it

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.570
a little bit deeper
here in a minute.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.314
But this is actually
what's on the phone.

00:09:33.314 --> 00:09:35.730
You can see it's moving, it's
scrolling, it's doing stuff.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.980
We go over here, and you can
actually see the network.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.755
So if I hit Reload on my
phone-- and you can actually

00:09:40.755 --> 00:09:42.380
see the network
request coming through.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.170
This is not a desktop site.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:44.340
This is actually a mobile site.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.030
This is really good because I'm
actually testing on the device

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.900
that my users are using.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.430
Wow, great comment--
#perfmatters.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.930
One of you will
tweet it tonight.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.700
It will happen.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.255
I'll keep drilling it into you.

00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:58.880
But the cool thing
is, you can actually

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.921
see what's going on here.

00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:02.090
And notice, for this
particular website,

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.630
that it's actually
not done loading yet.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.725
You can still see the bar
moving on the side over there.

00:10:07.725 --> 00:10:10.100
And the funny thing is, if
you load this site in desktop,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.867
you don't see that same problem.

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:13.700
So obviously, there's
an issue on the mobile

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.830
that is not showing
up on the desktop.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.590
Again, we need to make sure that
we're testing things properly.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.173
But the cool thing
is, we can actually

00:10:20.173 --> 00:10:23.180
see all of the same events, use
the DevTools in the same way,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.070
minus everything crashing
because of memory issues, which

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.000
might happen tonight.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.250
I apologize for the live feed.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.170
But we can actually go through
here and just record memory

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.270
and see what's
going on in memory.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.670
And so let me show
you over here.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.400
I can go through and actually
scroll and go back and actually

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.790
see how memory is adjusting
based on this stuff.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.422
So if you haven't adopted
this Chrome ADB extension

00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:44.880
into your tooling
and your testing,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.240
you need to definitely do this.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.615
Definitely get
this in your stuff

00:10:47.615 --> 00:10:50.220
because no other tool allows
you this sort of integration.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.220
And Chrome DevTools are
already top of the line.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.303
This should be part of it.

00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:55.360
So anyhow, enough
of me babbling.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.412
So let's start with one
of the first sites here.

00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:59.675
Come on, clicky clicky.

00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:03.860
Now there's a native app
for you, slow when loading.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.740
Right, Forecastio?

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.450
Aw, I'll get it right.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.070
Sorry.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.589
So we're going to try this
first one here, allout.org.

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:12.380
This was submitted.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.910
Someone in the room
submitted this.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.370
I don't know who it is.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:14.940
Doesn't matter.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.060
But we're going to take
a look at your site,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.950
and hopefully, we're
going to make you upset.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.870
So this is loading.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.471
I'm going to show you what
the page looks like first.

00:11:22.471 --> 00:11:24.220
So first off, we all
just watched it load.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.650
This is on a 4G connection.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.840
I'm not on the local Wi-Fi.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.480
We can see that this actually
is not a mobile site.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.950
I mean, I shouldn't
have to scroll.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:36.910
Oh, I can zoom.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.680
Yay.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.572
But most of the site
is actually eclipsed.

00:11:41.572 --> 00:11:43.530
We've got some sort of
spinner here at the top,

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.160
but it's a marquee movement.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.224
We've got some other items
down here on the bottom.

00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:49.140
Some stuff's going on.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.880
So let's take a
look at what that

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.470
looks like in Chrome DevTools.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.945
So I can go here, click Inspect.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.809
Again, native
applications, they're slow.

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:00.100
So let's go to the Network tab.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.316
And I want to take a look
at how this thing loads.

00:12:02.316 --> 00:12:03.690
So I'm going to
hit Reload again,

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.441
and we're going to watch
all the assets come through.

00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:07.940
And notice here,
on the bottom here,

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.830
you can see six
requests, 12 requests.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.413
I'll keep scrolling
down to the bottom

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:13.250
so you can kind of see that.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.970
Seven seconds worth of load time
before it's actually loaded.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.636
So this down here on
the bottom tells us

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:20.449
that it took about six seconds
before content complete was

00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:22.990
actually kind of issued, before
the page load event occurred,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.500
and 7.9 seconds total.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.000
8K actually came-- oh,
no, we're still not done.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.780
9K came through, pardon me.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.630
And so 34 requests.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.640
We can actually see the
health of this object

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.320
and the health of this site.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.028
Now 34 requests, that's
actually nothing.

00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:38.580
9K, that's a drop in the bucket.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.080
The Robitussin-laced
grandmother picture from earlier

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.412
could easily load
9K very quickly.

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:45.870
What's important here, though,
and I want to show you this,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.282
is when we go up here and
actually sort by size,

00:12:48.282 --> 00:12:49.990
we actually get a
different sort of sense

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.000
of the content that's
being sent around.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.870
So we can see--
let me not do that.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.780
There we go.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.540
So we can actually
see the images loaded.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.230
We can actually see that most
of the large assets here, 6.4K,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.610
512 bytes.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.241
We can see that the
large images here-- this

00:13:05.241 --> 00:13:06.490
is actually interesting to me.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.710
So this is a 1,024 by 576.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:11.236
It's 213K.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.930
Quick round of applause.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:16.846
Who thinks that's too
large for a mobile site?

00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:18.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:18.134 --> 00:13:19.012
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:13:19.012 --> 00:13:19.970
OK, here's another one.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.230
Here's 109K, a
little bit better.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.250
Same resolution, though.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.410
Anyone notice that?

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.190
Same resolution, half the size.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.180
Now if anyone in here-- a
quick other round of applause.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.630
Who's written a JPEG compressor?

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.290
One guy, two guys, three guys.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.030
All right.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.130
We'll get some beers
later, and we'll

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:37.360
talk about DCT coefficients.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.610
I've had this really cool
idea that you can actually--

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:40.730
you know what, never mind.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.640
So notice, though, that
this image actually

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.510
has a lot more data to it.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.667
There's a lot more edges.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.250
There's a lot more
noise to the image.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.920
Yet it's smaller
than this one here.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.140
This is actually mostly pink.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.610
There's no reason that
the image with more detail

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.322
should be less size than the
one with less detail in it.

00:13:56.322 --> 00:13:58.780
What this tells me-- I know
nothing about these developers.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.740
I know nothing about the site.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.020
But this tells me that
they're not actually

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.740
exporting this particular image
with the right compression

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:04.660
settings.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.110
So another-- I like doing
these polls because it's late,

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.100
and I need you all entertained.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.210
So how many of you
actually just export

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.460
your images at some
constant format.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.520
Like when you do an export from
a JPEG, it's like on 12 or 80,

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.440
depending on what you're doing.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:24.160
So no-- everyone else
hand-optimizes exactly

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.680
your exact, perfect PSNR
relationship for your JPEG.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.180
Yes?

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.190
Is that what I'm hearing?

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.340
Because I saw like three hands.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.048
So either you're all
lying to each other,

00:14:33.048 --> 00:14:35.730
or you have no idea the way
that your images are compressed.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.790
OK, round of applause for no
idea the compression quality.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:38.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.169
COLT MCANLIS: OK, fantastic.

00:14:40.169 --> 00:14:41.710
So seeing this site
actually tells us

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.780
that this is a systemic problem.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.160
And again, the 3,000
developers I've

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.340
talked to over the past
week all see this problem.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.220
In a couple of
the other websites

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.594
I'm going to load
tonight, you're

00:14:48.594 --> 00:14:51.720
going to see this show up very
prevalently that in general, we

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.950
as a web community do a
horrible, horrible job

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.310
of optimizing images for
quality against size.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.030
Now in reality,
this isn't something

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:01.300
that's that difficult.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.800
Most of us consider
a single way pipe.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.920
We have artists or designers
that are working in a vacuum.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.060
They're trying to optimize
for the visual quality

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.710
of the image.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.440
Meanwhile, there's
bald engineers

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.534
in a corner somewhere
going, why is my site slow?

00:15:14.534 --> 00:15:16.950
And there's this constant back
and forth between these two

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.177
camps about size of
images versus quality

00:15:19.177 --> 00:15:21.010
of images and load times
and all this stuff.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.470
Let me give you a
little word of advice.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:25.000
If any of you are able to
implement something like this,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.642
it's very simple to spin
up an Amazon EC2 instance

00:15:28.642 --> 00:15:30.350
or even do this at
your desk and actually

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.630
run a compressor, a
command line compressor,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.320
like libjpeg or
jpeg-turbo-- by the way,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.780
jpeg-turbo is the actual
codec that we use inside

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.680
of Chrome for JPEGs--
and actually compress it

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.247
at various quality settings and
test the PSNR of the images.

00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:45.830
PSNR, for those of
you who don't know,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:48.000
is Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.340
This is actually a
measurement of the amount

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.130
of noise and error
that's introduced

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.034
to an image, the
blockiness that actually

00:15:55.034 --> 00:15:56.450
comes from the
compression format.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.241
We actually have a
standardization process.

00:15:58.241 --> 00:16:01.550
We call it PSNR, and that's how
we compare image compressors

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.270
to each other.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.250
So you could actually take your
image, compress it at level 90,

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.200
see what the PSNR is, compress
it at 80, see what the PSNR is.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.770
70, 60, 50, 40, 30.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.020
If you get below 30,
you've gone too far.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.940
Just stop at 30.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.190
But the cool thing about
this is that you can actually

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.320
run 10,000, 20,000, 30,000
images through this process,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.660
and for each one find the
exact right compression

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.780
value to give you a
PSNR of around 38 to 45.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.450
So you're not actually
just exporting

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.487
to a single compression
number, a slider

00:16:30.487 --> 00:16:32.320
that your artists have
no idea what it does.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.694
You can actually
programmatically

00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:36.260
find this value by implementing
a simple iterative process

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.760
against the command
line compressor.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.170
That's kind of cool.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.310
Round of applause for cool.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.577
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:43.410
COLT MCANLIS: I saw
some of you begrudgingly

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.600
go, that's not cool.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.550
Let's save the
questions for the end,

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:48.200
if that's OK, because otherwise
I'm going to stare at Putin,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.622
and he kind of scares me.

00:16:50.622 --> 00:16:52.580
So let's take a look at
some other things here.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.871
So I want to go over timelines.

00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:54.860
So that was load time.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.360
Everyone knows
the network stuff.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:01.235
If you're not using
WebPagetest.org or ModPagespeed

00:17:01.235 --> 00:17:03.270
or PageSpeed Insights
and all that stuff,

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.750
you need to be using all that.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.069
So let's just take a
look at what this site's

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.371
doing while I'm doing nothing.

00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:08.829
So now I haven't
touched this site.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.530
To be clear, my
phone almost actually

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.050
went locked because
I haven't touched it.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.609
I'm still not touching
it, but I want

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.692
you to notice what the
memory is doing on the top.

00:17:15.692 --> 00:17:18.970
Now I'm a C++ game developer.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.430
To me, the only thing that
matters for performance

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.210
is follow the memory.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.720
I actually give a
talk at Velocity

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.260
yesterday where I, in
a very heretic fashion,

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.890
suggested that web developers
were really bad developers

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.725
because we're not
controlling our memory.

00:17:32.725 --> 00:17:34.980
We're actually letting
JavaScript do it for us.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.510
And because of this,
we have no idea

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.490
what's going on under the hood.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.640
How many of you know
what your heap size is?

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.680
How many of you care?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.420
That's another question.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.005
I like that.

00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:45.930
I like your outfit.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.557
Is that like a
cummer-- What is that?

00:17:47.557 --> 00:17:48.890
Is that like a real [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:49.800
Yeah, I like that.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.310
That's cool.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.476
I might have to get me one
of those. #perfmatters, I

00:17:52.476 --> 00:17:54.379
got to get me one of those.

00:17:54.379 --> 00:17:55.670
So again, I've touched nothing.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.003
But notice this here on the top.

00:17:57.003 --> 00:17:58.550
I don't know if you
guys can see it.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.816
It's allocating between
7.5 megs and 9 megs.

00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:02.690
I'm touching nothing.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.106
Nothing's occurring
on the screen.

00:18:04.106 --> 00:18:07.740
Yet two megabytes of data are
being allocated and cleared

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.580
in this environment.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.080
Now I can actually
figure out what's

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.356
going on with this--
if I stop my recording,

00:18:13.356 --> 00:18:14.230
too much information.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.896
Let me just do a quick
record real quick

00:18:15.896 --> 00:18:18.755
so I can clear all that.

00:18:18.755 --> 00:18:20.630
So we can see something
on the timeline here.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.130
So it looks like,
first off, they've

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.120
got two different timers firing.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.744
So we've got widgets.js
and Chartbeat.

00:18:25.744 --> 00:18:27.910
Chartbeat, I'm guessing,
is like an analytics thing.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.840
I see this on a bunch of
sites you guys gave me.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.506
And then widgets seems
like their thing.

00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:33.820
So I'm guessing this is that
marquee scroll at the top.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.403
They've got some
timer that's actually

00:18:35.403 --> 00:18:36.880
moving those images around.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.340
What I don't like-- pardon?

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.442
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:39.442 --> 00:18:40.650
COLT MCANLIS: For widgets.js?

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.850
Oh, cool.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:43.570
Oh, nice.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.460
Widgets.js, Twitter.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:47.960
Oh, cool.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.350
So Twitter is actually
screwing this page up.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.849
Go Twitter.

00:18:49.849 --> 00:18:51.380
Is anyone here from Twitter?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.386
Boo, Twitter.

00:18:54.386 --> 00:18:55.760
So what we see
down here, though,

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.920
is we see recalculate
and paint and what not.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.420
For our memory, this
view doesn't actually

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.790
tell us what's being allocated.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.520
We can see where the events
are occurring and whatnot.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.364
I can actually mouse over the
GCs when they actually happen.

00:19:08.364 --> 00:19:10.030
More importantly,
though, I can actually

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.200
go over here to
the Profiles page.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.140
Because I don't like
seeing that kind of memory.

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.310
And I can actually do a
record of heap applications.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.970
So I can just hit start
and let this thing run.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.365
And basically, what you're
seeing here is on this top,

00:19:19.365 --> 00:19:21.740
you're kind of seeing timeline
view plus memory profiling

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.560
at the same time.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.240
In the top, any of
these blue lines

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.140
is when memory
allocations occur.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.520
Now when you see a grey line,
what the grey line means is

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.220
that memory has been freed by
a garbage collection process

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:32.900
somewhere.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.810
So you can actually see a
new set that just happened,

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.800
and some of the
grey lines happened.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.740
But these blues tend
to kind of pop up

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.980
in a very regular fashion.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.490
Now in this, I can
actually go through here

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.850
and change the size of
my window and actually

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.090
see exactly what was allocated.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.480
So in this single event,
at about eight seconds

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.255
in in my capture, about 3K
worth of data was allocated.

00:19:55.255 --> 00:19:57.171
And we can see a similar
pattern over here.

00:19:57.171 --> 00:19:59.170
I can highlight this
window, and we see another,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.667
about almost 3K.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:02.000
And over here, a similar window.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.920
There's about 3K, plus
a lot of extra change

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.420
there that hasn't
been freed up yet.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.170
But let me focus on
this guy really quick.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.950
So here I can actually see that
3K came from compiled code.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.966
So somewhere in this system,
deoptimization code came from.

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:15.590
Now for those of you
who are not versed

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.610
in fast path and
slow path JavaScript,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.360
effectively what this
little block of data

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.510
you're seeing here-- see
that optimization data?

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.219
The way that V8 and most
modern JavaScript VMs work

00:20:25.219 --> 00:20:26.760
is they will actually
try to optimize

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.580
your code on your behalf
because, I mean, come on.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.810
You're a stupid programmer.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.010
You don't know
how to write code.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.460
Obviously, the VM
knows better than you

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.310
because it's a machine, and
it's fast, and it's smart.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.910
So what it'll actually
do is take a code path

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.990
that you've written, and
it'll actually optimize it.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.890
It'll manage the memory.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.556
It'll make some fast
path optimizations,

00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:42.627
and it'll put it out there
and start running it.

00:20:42.627 --> 00:20:44.210
Well, the problem
is that it does this

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.543
with some assumptions about
the state of the environment

00:20:46.543 --> 00:20:47.240
that it's in.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.737
And it'll do this, and
oftentime, it'll break.

00:20:49.737 --> 00:20:51.820
And it'll go, whoa, we
actually cause an exception

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.540
somewhere in the stack
due to our optimization,

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.720
because we're just
a stupid robot,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.844
and we actually don't know
what we're doing either.

00:20:56.844 --> 00:20:58.420
When this happens,
basically Chrome

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.020
has to create this new block
of code that's parallel

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.779
to the block of code you had,
delete your block of code,

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.320
put your new block of code in
the stack, and have it execute.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.720
When that deoptimization
occurs, because the optimization

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.877
failed, it has to take
your old block of code,

00:21:12.877 --> 00:21:14.710
put it back in, and
delete the block of code

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.750
that it just created.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.350
So there are specific
code paths that

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.950
generally cause this to happen.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.450
Closures are one of them.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.247
How many of you are using
closures in your timers?

00:21:25.247 --> 00:21:25.830
Don't applaud.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.726
I don't want you
to applaud that.

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:30.100
Closures are one
of these things.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.766
If you actually have
a closure running--

00:21:31.766 --> 00:21:33.310
so it's very common
for people to do

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.800
set interval closure
comma 1,000, right?

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.370
That closure in
that set interval

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.170
is actually causing these
sorts of memory leaks to occur.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.380
It's a deoptimization path
that V8 can't optimize around.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.000
And so basically, every
single time you're doing this,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.986
you're running into
this situation.

00:21:48.986 --> 00:21:50.860
So let's look at something
else really quick.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.120
So I want to go over
here and show you

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.480
what I'm seeing on the screen.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.800
Now I've turned on a couple
modes on the developer tools.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.680
So first off, you'll see
this beautiful little--

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.310
you can't see it too well.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.740
I wonder if I can tilt my
phone just a little bit.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.950
You can see up at the
top that I actually

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.780
have a little graph
showing me frame rate

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.620
as well as how much GPU
memory is being used.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.800
So that's actually--
quick show of hands,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.187
who understands how a
web page is painted?

00:22:18.187 --> 00:22:20.270
It's like the same guys
that wrote JPEG compilers.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.820
OK.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.903
So for everyone else, let
me do this really quick.

00:22:22.903 --> 00:22:28.320
How your page is rasterized
is a delicate ballet.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.842
Really, it's more like boxing.

00:22:29.842 --> 00:22:32.050
It's basically two people
smashing each other's faces

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.060
in for about six
milliseconds a frame.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:37.980
Effectively, what happens is
Chrome will take your web page,

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.020
and it will dice it up.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.020
It'll create square regions
of 256 by 256 tiles.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.230
For each one of these tiles,
it'll actually spin up a thread

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.640
and actually rasterize all
of the pixels in that tile,

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.370
all of the WebKit--
well, Blink now.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.670
Sorry, I've got to get
my terminology right--

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.960
all of the page elements,
and actually composite that

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.960
to a CPU chunk of memory,
32 bits per pixel,

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.210
256 by 256 tile.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.110
And it'll rasterize
all that data in there.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.568
Once that data is
rasterized, it'll

00:23:04.568 --> 00:23:06.140
then upload it to the GPU.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:09.510
When you scroll a page,
the GPU is actually

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.086
the thing that's
moving your page.

00:23:11.086 --> 00:23:12.835
Now for those of you--
some of you in here

00:23:12.835 --> 00:23:14.340
are young, much younger than me.

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:17.170
You may not know this, but
back before "Quake III"

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.120
was hardware accelerated,
we had something

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.530
called software rasterization.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.030
Yeah?

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.030
Software rasterization?

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.359
"Heretic," "Doom,"
"Quake," anybody?

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.150
Any other professional
gamers in the house?

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.640
Yeah.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.980
So back then, we used a term
called software rasterization.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.680
This was generally OK,
but once we invented GPUs,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.570
GPUs are basically
hardware rasterization.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.360
They're built to take pixels
and put them on the screen.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.050
They're dedicated
silicon for this.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.930
But Chrome is actually still
using software rasterization

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.560
to paint the pixels
on the screen.

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.360
This means that
this is a slow path.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.943
This also means that
every one of you,

00:23:47.943 --> 00:23:50.050
right now, should be
really, really scared,

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.400
because how many of you have
actually tested whether or not

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.460
those rounded corners and drop
shadows affect your render

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.370
time?

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.745
They do, actually,
quite frankly.

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:03.203
If you go to "HTML5 Rocks," I
actually did a study on this.

00:24:03.203 --> 00:24:03.790
Ha ha.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.840
I'm sorry, that was
a leading question.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.423
That was mean.

00:24:05.423 --> 00:24:07.190
I knew that you didn't
know that answer.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.840
But basically what happens
is your CSS effects actually

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.147
cause-- it has to be
software rasterized, which

00:24:13.147 --> 00:24:15.480
means we have to actually go
and draw rounded rectangles

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.104
and then actually add a drop
shadow to the side of it.

00:24:18.104 --> 00:24:19.520
And this actually
takes more time.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.311
In fact, if you have
those two combinations

00:24:21.311 --> 00:24:23.450
of things together,
it actually takes 4x

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.400
as long as each one
of them individually.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.340
Which means that there's
combinations of CSS properties

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.452
that hurt your rendering
performance more than others.

00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:34.160
Hopefully all of you
are going, dear god,

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.914
I have to test this right now.

00:24:35.914 --> 00:24:38.330
And how you can test this, as
you can actually see up here

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.296
in this GPU, this
frame rate meter,

00:24:40.296 --> 00:24:42.170
is that as you're
scrolling, you can actually

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.342
see the milliseconds taken to
render that part of your page.

00:24:45.342 --> 00:24:46.800
Now what you're
also seeing here is

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.250
notice this big red box
that keeps popping up?

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.090
This is actually a mode
in Chrome DevTools.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:51.790
Let me show you this.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.340
And I know I'm spending
more time on this site.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.730
As we go to the
other sites, you'll

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:55.800
actually see this
stuff play out.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.960
But I need to kind of
test the groundwork here.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.525
Is that in or left?

00:24:59.525 --> 00:25:00.150
AUDIENCE: Left.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:00.580
COLT MCANLIS: Left.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:01.130
Oh, wow, OK.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.350
I'll keep working.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.249
So anyhow, I have show
paint rectangles on.

00:25:04.249 --> 00:25:06.290
Basically, what this does
is when I turn this on,

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.730
it's going to show
a red rectangle

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:09.950
for every part of the page
that actually gets repainted.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.908
So this actually tells
me what part of the page

00:25:11.908 --> 00:25:13.880
is being rerasterized.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.880
Which is really cool
to know because I'm

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.910
pretty sure all of you
will look at your site

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.830
and find that you've got some
little square icon like this,

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.500
but for some reason, it's
rasterizing like a 6x size

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.100
window of that, that all has
to be processed on the CPU.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.210
This slows down your page.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.180
It creates jank.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.309
I hate that word.

00:25:29.309 --> 00:25:31.350
Hitching, by the way,
hitching is the right term.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.850
Every other medium,
video games, AV, movies,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.310
it's called hitching.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.400
Just, can we all
agree to use hitching?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.510
No?

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.170
I'll get hitchfree.org later.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:42.856
Anyhow, let me move
on to the next site

00:25:42.856 --> 00:25:45.480
because I want to make sure that
we talk about some more stuff.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.940
But basically, you can
see that on this site,

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.190
there there's a couple things.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.120
First off, they're
sending two large images

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.490
to a mobile device.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:52.740
They don't have a mobile view.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.190
They don't have a
mindset of a viewport

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:56.960
for these mobile environments.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.720
Plus it seems like their
marquee is actually

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.899
rendering and updating
different parts of the page

00:26:01.899 --> 00:26:02.940
at different frequencies.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.410
They're allocating about
a meg of memory per minute

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.000
or so when no one's
touching anything.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.437
So if this is your
site, fix those things

00:26:11.437 --> 00:26:12.270
because you need to.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.800
And also, your load time
is pretty harsh, too.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.470
So let's do this next one.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.170
So this next one
should be pretty quick.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.180
I just want to highlight
something really,

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.270
really poignant here.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.100
So I'm going to close this.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.020
Which view are you on?

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.519
OK.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.710
So let's show you.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.040
So this is DoSomething.org,
a cool little website.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.520
It kind of just
encourages everyone

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.860
to do something interesting in
small, little-- small butterfly

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.000
wings change the course of tides
in Africa and all that stuff.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.910
But we see it's a pretty
simple website, just kind

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.560
of a little strata of
images and whatnot.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.110
When we go over here
to Chrome DevTools,

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.610
let's inspect this
information here.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.480
And I'm going to put this
back on the Network tab,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.340
and we're going to go
ahead and reload this.

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.220
So we can actually see that
the page loaded pretty quickly.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.480
We got a lot of
information really quick.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.230
About 2.9 seconds, so
this is a lot better

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.960
than the previous website.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.324
We're right around that
three second load time.

00:27:09.324 --> 00:27:10.490
And again, this is on my 4G.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.360
I'm not on the wireless.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.276
So that's pretty good.

00:27:12.276 --> 00:27:14.800
10K transferred,
that's all right.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.550
21 requests, not
that bad at all.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.750
So let's again sort by size.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:20.080
Let's see if anything's
coming up here.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.210
I got a couple not founds.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.490
That's not necessarily
a good idea.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.092
A couple images here.

00:27:27.092 --> 00:27:28.050
So this is interesting.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.780
Again, another 106K image
that's being delivered

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.689
to a mobile screen that
obviously does not need 106K.

00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:35.980
That one's a little bit better.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:36.550
Well, not better.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.174
I mean, that's a very
depressing image.

00:27:38.174 --> 00:27:42.280
I didn't mean that
that was-- again,

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.030
my opinions are my
own and not that

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.660
of any organization
or secret service

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.049
that I'm influenced with.

00:27:47.049 --> 00:27:48.840
So we can actually see
some of these images

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.520
may be a little bit
larger than others.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.395
But for the most part,
this is actually nice.

00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:54.133
Where did-- what happened here?

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:59.500
Did I-- this technology,
isn't it great?

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.730
So we can actually see, though,
that this page is actually

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.226
a pretty good example of
what to do on a website.

00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.600
If you load this on the desktop,
what you'll actually see

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.610
is that there's larger
versions of these images.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.370
They're tiled differently
with a different layout.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.494
There's a different scheme.

00:28:12.494 --> 00:28:14.420
But in the mobile
version, they really only

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.086
have one or two images
that are probably

00:28:16.086 --> 00:28:17.982
too large for the mobile device.

00:28:17.982 --> 00:28:19.440
But in the most
part, this actually

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.030
scrolls pretty quickly.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:24.080
I know you can't see
it up in the top, here

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.795
but this is actually about
three milliseconds to five

00:28:27.795 --> 00:28:29.920
milliseconds to actually
draw the part of the page.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.020
And you can actually see
that as I'm scrolling,

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.610
notice that there's
no red tiles.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.282
You don't see those
big red flashes.

00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:38.490
What that means is that this
entire page has actually

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:40.720
been rasterized on the CPU
and uploaded to the GPU,

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.890
and it's been cached in the GPU.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.540
And so as you're
scrolling up and down,

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.320
the CPU doesn't
have to do any work.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.440
So this is what you want.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.770
You want no red blocks
going on in your page.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:50.330
All right.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.807
So let's do another
site here really quick.

00:28:52.807 --> 00:28:55.140
Because now I'm freaking out
that I only got 30 minutes.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:58.800
COLT MCANLIS: Yes.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.430
Oh, we're going all night.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:04.570
Let's just open
up every website.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.594
OK, so this is the one we
saw a little bit earlier.

00:29:07.594 --> 00:29:09.760
Sorry, I don't know if my
antics distracted you all.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.559
Let's reload this again.

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.850
Let's see how the load time is.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.380
So notice on the top here
that it's about halfway.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.755
So this page hasn't
unloaded yet.

00:29:17.755 --> 00:29:19.755
Let's just be clear about
what we're looking at.

00:29:19.755 --> 00:29:21.024
This is an instant load.

00:29:21.024 --> 00:29:22.940
Now we've actually gotten
to the loading part.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.290
If this is your
website, I'm sorry.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.660
Hopefully, you understand
there's work that needs to do.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.535
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:37.327 --> 00:29:38.410
COLT MCANLIS: It might be.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.822
Let's find out.

00:29:39.822 --> 00:29:41.530
So again, over here,
let's go to Inspect.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.865
I wonder if I can just
catch this midstream,

00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:44.820
if it'll just tell me
what that image is,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.030
or if I have to hit reload.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:49.160
It's still loading.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.490
OK, here, I'll hit Reload,
see what goes on here.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.350
Ooh.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.200
Oh, web fonts.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.830
OK, we'll take a look
at that in a second.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.010
OK, so I hit Reload.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.350
This is waiting to reload.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.052
So obviously, there's already
some problems with this site.

00:30:02.052 --> 00:30:03.760
Hopefully, someone in
here is going like,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.620
uh, please stop
clicking buttons.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.050
Please take my website off
of your screen, you angry,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:11.700
bald man.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.290
OK.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.400
Let's let see how
this is going here.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.300
So you can't see the screen.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.400
It's still loading.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.730
The font's just now appeared.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.770
Let's take a look at
what's going on here

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.280
and see whether or not we can
discuss some of these items.

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:28.140
So let's sort by size here.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.535
This is something I want
to let everybody know.

00:30:30.535 --> 00:30:32.910
This is the first thing I want
to point out on this site.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.250
This is a WOFF file.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.050
It's a web font.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.700
Round of applause if you're
using web fonts in your site.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:39.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.880
COLT MCANLIS: Good.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.760
Please stop.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.290
Please, please stop.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.255
This is a-- I don't
know if you saw this.

00:30:48.255 --> 00:30:49.380
Yeah, web fonts look great.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.046
They're awesome.

00:30:50.046 --> 00:30:51.930
This is 38K for that web font.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.824
And unfortunately, some
of these have been cached,

00:30:54.824 --> 00:30:57.240
so you can't actually see the
true size of a lot of these.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.989
But there's actually like five
or six web fonts on this page.

00:30:59.989 --> 00:31:01.780
So you guys are kind
of getting a bum deal.

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.464
You're not seeing
how horrible this is.

00:31:03.464 --> 00:31:04.880
But basically,
here's what happens

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.930
is when you've got
five web fonts,

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.490
each one can be somewhere
between the range of 40K

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.590
and like 90K for a font.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.600
That font is required
before text can actually

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.240
be drawn to your screen.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.460
So pop quiz.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.890
What happens if you're
ready to draw text,

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.440
and your CSS is down, and
your JavaScript is down,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.980
and your images are down,
but your WOFF isn't down yet?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.670
Good answer.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.450
I don't know.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.930
No one said anything.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:30.805
Good answer, nothing.

00:31:30.805 --> 00:31:31.540
Nothing happens.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:32.300
Chrome will do nothing.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.960
Chrome will block.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.580
Chrome will wait.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.720
Chrome will wait for every
single one of your WOFFs

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.090
to come down before a
single character of text

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.003
is drawn on your screen.

00:31:41.003 --> 00:31:44.101
AUDIENCE: Uh, it will
point at one WOFF.

00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:46.100
It will render all the
text that uses that WOFF.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.780
COLT MCANLIS: Jake
Archibald says I'm dumb.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.030
If that single WOFF is
visible, it'll render that one.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.440
Now Firefox will do it a
little bit differently.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.260
Basically, what
it'll do is it'll

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.650
wait three seconds, right, Jake?

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:54.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.420
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.260
It'll wait three seconds.

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:57.343
Maybe you should continue.

00:31:57.343 --> 00:31:59.523
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:59.523 --> 00:32:01.481
COLT MCANLIS: I'm having
an awkward mic moment.

00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.064
Basically, what'll
happen with Firefox

00:32:03.064 --> 00:32:04.874
is it'll start the
request for the WOFF.

00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:06.790
If it hasn't been
downloaded in three seconds,

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:10.540
it'll actually keep
allowing that to download,

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.000
but it'll actually display
the font with a default.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.240
Like it'll just see Arial.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.850
So if you're actually
seeing this on Firefox,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.660
you'll see like three
seconds of nothing,

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.980
and then you'll see Arial, and
then when the font comes in,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.313
you'll see it pop to whatever
the font's supposed to be.

00:32:22.313 --> 00:32:23.620
And so you see this flicker.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.190
I see it.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.600
You see it a lot on mobile,
because these mobile devices

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.540
are actually 6x slower
in hardware, just

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.069
across the board-- probably
for at least another two years,

00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:34.485
depending on which hardware
manufacturer you're trending--

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.984
than what you're
seeing on desktops.

00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:38.130
Not only is it slower to
download these things,

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.710
but these WOFFs are actually
very complex spline paths

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.630
that have to be interpreted by
these underpowered ARM chips

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:44.260
as well.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.300
Anyone in here written
a software rasterizer?

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.165
Cool.

00:32:48.165 --> 00:32:50.690
Spline paths are slow.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.530
Anyhow, WOFFs are bad,
and you should feel bad

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.530
if you're using them in
your websites right now.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.850
Now, things are happening that
are trying to optimize this.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:58.890
I know that there's
people talking

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.265
about different ways to compress
WOFFs and different ways

00:33:01.265 --> 00:33:03.450
to use these type of
fonts in different ways.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.370
But please note that you have
them as part of your site,

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.100
you should feel bad.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.977
Now let me see if I can--
can I Shift-Reload this?

00:33:10.977 --> 00:33:12.230
I don't know.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.940
I can't get the data from cache.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.270
But we also see in here
a couple of these things,

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.400
and I can't show you this.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.030
But these images are
actually a little bit larger

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.600
than they should be as well.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.640
These are OK.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.540
Was that Willie Nelson?

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.640
I don't know.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.020
Again, there's another WOFF.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.850
This PNG, where was
its header on that?

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:31.650
This one's a WebP.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:32.560
Ooh, fantastic.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.060
So this guy's
actually using a WebP.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:36.800
Interesting.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.510
I don't know what that's doing.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.460
AUDIENCE: That was
the accept header.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.418
COLT MCANLIS: That was
the accept header, yeah.

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:42.660
So at least a WebP
did come down.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.210
However, we see that-- let's
go down here-- again, 124K.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.990
So again, you guys are
getting the bad rap

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.980
because I'm not doing a
cached fresh reload on this.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.900
But basically, this
site is using--

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.350
it's actually passing full
megabyte, two megabyte images

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.100
down.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.695
It's got the WOFFs in the
direct path to rendering,

00:33:59.695 --> 00:34:01.320
and so that's going
to take a long time

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.404
before text will show up.

00:34:02.404 --> 00:34:04.570
In fact, the image will try
to progressively load in

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.050
before all the text does.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.139
And this will annoy
your users a lot more.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.831
So let's try to avoid that.

00:34:09.831 --> 00:34:10.330
All right.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.594
Let's try another website
here really quick.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.210
Let me go over to this.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.659
Is anyone sad yet about
the state of things?

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.440
Is anyone going
like, wow, I wonder

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.010
how my site does under
this type of scrutiny?

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.000
If so, then yay,
I'm doing my job.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.321
I can get paid this week.

00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:31.820
Cool.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.469
That was actually pretty quick.

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.960
That actually wasn't that bad.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.834
Let me do that again.

00:34:40.922 --> 00:34:42.615
Yeah, that actually
wasn't that bad.

00:34:42.615 --> 00:34:47.980
Here, let me see if I can
hard-- load, load, load.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.480
Good.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.010
Cool, OK.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.320
So this might be a good site.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.250
Let's take a look at this one.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.540
So we'll hit Inspect again.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.265
We'll load it up.

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.770
Let's see here.

00:34:56.770 --> 00:35:00.860
Scrolling actually seems
pretty smooth on this site.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.220
Doesn't seem that bad.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.189
We can move stuff
around pretty easily.

00:35:06.189 --> 00:35:07.730
Let's take a look
at the Network tab.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.688
Let's hit Reload again.

00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:15.540
Again, unfortunately,
all of this stuff

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.748
is coming from the cache now.

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.248
I should've used
my other tablet.

00:35:19.248 --> 00:35:21.360
Dot com, CSS, not that bad.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.610
22K CSS, 27K CSS, 200K.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:32.430
I don't like this 192K JPEG
that's only 920 by 300.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.190
Notice this.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.630
So this is 192K
for an image that

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:40.430
is a quarter of
the size of Putin.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.740
Show of hands, who
knows what that means?

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.141
Yeah, not optimizing your JPEGs.

00:35:45.141 --> 00:35:47.390
I think there's actually
some other bad examples here.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.000
Here's another one, 240K.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.909
Oh, oh, 240K, 920 by 300.

00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:54.450
Does anyone off the
back of your hand

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.850
know what this is if it
were a raw image size?

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:03.445
So it's 920 times 300
times 24 bits per pixel?

00:36:03.445 --> 00:36:04.070
Get back to me.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.104
Jake'll give you some swag.

00:36:06.104 --> 00:36:07.270
Oh, there's a Facebook icon.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.010
Only 9K, yay.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.370
Well, OK.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.810
100 by 100 is 9K.

00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:14.862
That seems a little
bit excessive, right?

00:36:14.862 --> 00:36:17.320
That seems like there's actually
some bloat going on there.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.361
I wonder if there's like
a negative JPEG encoder.

00:36:19.361 --> 00:36:21.330
Make it larger.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.340
By the way, if any of you are
going to be in San Francisco

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:27.500
next week or have a chance
or have the internet,

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.210
I think, definitely tune into my
talk I'm giving on compression

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.202
on the web.

00:36:32.202 --> 00:36:34.160
And hopefully, if you've
seen my talk yesterday

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.140
about being scared of closures,
if you see my talk next week

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.480
on compression on the
web, hopefully compression

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.900
will scare you after
that, and you'll

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.530
trudge toward that
monster with a wary eye.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.990
But anyhow, 100K, 100K
pixels, 3.9K in size.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.160
So that actually seems a
little bit excessive there too.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.200
Here's, again-- those
are the same images.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.470
Here's another one.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.950
These are really large.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:57.892
180K being sent to
my mobile device.

00:36:57.892 --> 00:36:59.350
Now the reason this
loaded-- again,

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.250
this loaded a little fast.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.422
This is a bias because I've been
testing these things all day,

00:37:02.422 --> 00:37:03.320
and this is coming from cache.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.808
So you're not really feeling
as much pain as you should be.

00:37:05.808 --> 00:37:08.016
AUDIENCE: If you go to the
bottom of the [INAUDIBLE],

00:37:08.016 --> 00:37:10.890
you should be able
to disable the cache.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.020
COLT MCANLIS: Beautiful.

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.085
All right, Jake
Archibald for the win.

00:37:14.085 --> 00:37:15.210
Here, let's hit Reload now.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.740
There we go.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.341
Oh yeah.

00:37:22.341 --> 00:37:23.960
Oh, feel it.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.510
Feel it!

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:29.442
So awkward right now.

00:37:29.442 --> 00:37:31.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] JPEGs.

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.020
COLT MCANLIS: They kind
of should be, yeah.

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.429
Oh, so-- no one's hiding
their face right now,

00:37:37.429 --> 00:37:39.470
so maybe the guy who put
this site in isn't here,

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:41.370
or you've got a
great poker face.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.340
I will not bet
money against you.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.526
OK.

00:37:47.526 --> 00:37:48.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, then they shrink.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.649
COLT MCANLIS: And then
they shrink, right?

00:37:50.649 --> 00:37:52.460
So that's actually
a great point.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.910
I'll bring this up
really quick, too.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.060
How many of you have
responsive websites?

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.520
OK, you're doing it wrong.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.980
Let me ask that in a better way.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.600
How many of your
responsive websites

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.440
will actually resize the
image that you've been given?

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.630
Jake.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.140
AUDIENCE: What do you
mean by resizing it?

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.598
COLT MCANLIS: You
got a CSS resize.

00:38:13.598 --> 00:38:16.090
Are you changing the
properties of it?

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.890
If it comes down as 1024
by pixels by 1024 pixels,

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.060
and you display it as
900 pixels by 900 pixels,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:25.292
or something like
that, anybody resizing?

00:38:25.292 --> 00:38:27.000
You're telling me
every single one of you

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.630
gives exactly the right pixel
ratio for every single device

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:31.890
that loads your website.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:33.080
Is that what I'm hearing?

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.460
All right, that guy's
hiding his face,

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.300
so I know he's doing it wrong.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:35.730
You know what?

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:36.680
At least you're honest, brother.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.200
I got some swag
for you after this.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.770
So here's something a
lot of you don't know.

00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.010
Decoding a JPEG or a PNG
or a WebP file actually

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:47.052
takes time from your CPU.

00:38:47.052 --> 00:38:48.676
And in fact, you know
how I was talking

00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:50.570
about those tiles
getting rasterized?

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:53.390
What happens is before a
tile can be rasterized,

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.160
Chrome actually has
to go decompress

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.010
all the images that
are in that tile.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.390
Now when that tile is
evicted from the cache,

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.950
we're going to have to repaint
it again sometime later.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.160
Well, lo and behold,
there's actually

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.210
a texture decompression
cache as well.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.030
So there's a chance, a very
high, high, high chance

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.770
on mobile devices, that we'll
actually decompress a JPEG file

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:20.090
and then have to resize the
uncompressed version of it.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.590
So you're actually getting full
32-bit pixels actually being

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:25.130
resized from 1024 to 512.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.520
And then the next time you
have to render that image,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.510
you have to decompress
it and resize it again.

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:32.870
So if an image is split
between two tiles,

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.460
you can run into a
very awkward situation

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:39.040
where you have to decode and
resize that image for each tile

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.680
that it's split in.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.360
So if you're resizing your
images dynamically right now,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.051
this could be a
problem for your site.

00:39:48.051 --> 00:39:49.050
Hopefully, some of you--

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:51.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], should
we not do dynamic websites?

00:39:53.755 --> 00:39:55.630
COLT MCANLIS: Save the
questions for the end.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.720
AUDIENCE: OK, sorry.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.290
COLT MCANLIS: I
said it to that guy.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.150
I gotta say it to you, too.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.066
Was that because I
called you Forecastio?

00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:00.566
OK.

00:40:00.566 --> 00:40:01.522
That's all right.

00:40:01.522 --> 00:40:03.835
Much love.

00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:05.210
Anyhow, so I think
we kind of see

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.250
that this website
has some issues.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.250
And most of it is
on the Network tab.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.610
Let me go ahead and turn
on continuous show paint

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.260
rectangles as well, because
I want to show this off too.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.740
So see that red rectangle?

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:19.890
So you can kind of
see this little one.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:20.760
Let me show it on
the screen here.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.220
You can see this will pop it up.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.550
But watch this red rectangle
happen full screen.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.050
Did you

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.990
See that?

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.790
See that again?

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.800
Poom, poom, poomp.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.810
Poom, poom, poom.

00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.150
I see this almost on every
single site on this list.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.070
Basically, they've
got a marquee on top.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.380
And that marquee,
for some reason,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.090
is actually invalidating the
entire page below it as well.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:44.030
So the actual div that's
expanding this thing that's

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:48.334
getting repainted is touching
every single pixel on the page.

00:40:48.334 --> 00:40:50.750
Which means that even sitting
here doing nothing, actually

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.530
the CPUs just sitting
here spinning and spinning

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.180
and spinning and spinning
and working and working.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.910
And that's actually going to
make scrolling not as smooth

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:57.570
as possible.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.780
And you can't see it.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.160
I can feel it a little bit here.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.891
This is actually a
pretty janky website.

00:41:01.891 --> 00:41:04.390
Up at the top, it says that our
average frame rate right now

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.870
is about 18 frames a
second, 17 frames a second.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.360
I can actually really
feel this on mobile.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.440
Now I have 30 minutes.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.220
Yes.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.767
15 minutes of filler.

00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:17.100
So obviously, this is a problem.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.780
And because when I see
something dynamic like this,

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.380
I generally think that memory
is going wonky as well.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.850
So let's go ahead and do a
timeline and hit Record again.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.090
Let's see what's going on.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.550
We've seen this before, right?

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.757
Same pattern we saw
with the other site.

00:41:32.757 --> 00:41:35.340
We see just kind of memory, just
being allocated and allocated

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.079
and allocated and allocated.

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:39.120
Let's hit Stop and see if
we can drill in and see

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:39.953
what the culprit is.

00:41:39.953 --> 00:41:42.100
Again, I know nothing
of these websites.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.270
I'm just a primitive
C++ developer.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.320
Your web development
scares and confuses me.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.971
So let's go to Profile,
and let's do a record heap

00:41:51.971 --> 00:41:52.470
allocation.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:53.535
So we can see that
memory's a problem.

00:41:53.535 --> 00:41:55.076
Now let's dig in a
little bit deeper.

00:41:55.076 --> 00:41:57.270
Let's record a heap allocation.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.770
OK.

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.770
Again, I'm not touching
anything on the website,

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.900
and memory, 10K, 5K, 10K, 5K.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.570
Let's hit Stop.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:08.690
Let's try to drill in
here on one of these guys.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.860
Let's just look at this one.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.080
Compiled code.

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.550
Looks familiar again.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.470
Oh, wow.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.510
It's almost like we've seen
this exact three lines of code

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.660
before.

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.369
So again, I know
nothing of this website.

00:42:20.369 --> 00:42:22.243
I haven't even looked
at the source code yet.

00:42:22.243 --> 00:42:24.540
But something in here is
already passing a closure

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.860
to a set timeout-- or
a set interval, sorry.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.746
Set timeout is a different
operating system.

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:30.870
But there's some other
stuff going on in here, too.

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.390
It looks like some other
relocation info is going on.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:35.160
I don't see any
injections, which is good.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.890
So no one's calling eval,
because otherwise we'd probably

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.556
see this 6K worth of
information-- someone laughed.

00:42:40.556 --> 00:42:41.430
That's probably good.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.400
Eval is bad, and
you should feel bad.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.810
So if you're using closures
and eval, just get out.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.010
Just get out, dude.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:50.510
I'm going to see a tweet.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:55.252
Colt says, use set interval with
closure and eval #permatters.

00:42:55.252 --> 00:42:57.105
Yeah, with a WOFF,
inside of a WOFF.

00:42:57.105 --> 00:42:58.730
By the way, I saw
someone the other day

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.135
that actually had a WOFF
embedded inside of a CSS.

00:43:01.135 --> 00:43:02.260
And I was like, OK.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.180
That's just a bad idea
from all principles.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:08.001
So the CSS gets bloated, and
then the WOFF has to be--

00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:10.000
Anyhow, we see that this
other part is an array.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.284
Now this is interesting.

00:43:11.284 --> 00:43:12.700
So when you see
this array object,

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.720
this means this is an
actual JavaScript array that

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.060
is allocated
somewhere on the page.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.559
And you can see
some of it is coming

00:43:17.559 --> 00:43:20.530
from internal with V8,
the code deopt data.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.230
But otherwise, the relocation
info, here's like a null.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.190
A null array is just being
created for no reason,

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.170
and no items are
being added to it.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:30.560
We can go down here
to string, and we

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.970
can see a GM string has
been created somewhere.

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:34.870
Let's scroll this up.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:35.995
Do we have any information?

00:43:35.995 --> 00:43:37.119
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:37.910
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.100
Yeah, that's what's
going on right here.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.050
So there's regex
occurring somewhere.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:41.967
A GM is being created.

00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:43.674
And then there's some
system level stuff.

00:43:43.674 --> 00:43:45.320
This is mostly
dragons and krakens

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.334
and other things going
on under the hood.

00:43:47.334 --> 00:43:48.750
If we expand this
a little bit, we

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:52.640
can actually slide over and
see, again, compiled code.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.120
There's another relocation info.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.881
Let's see if there's
a deopt this time.

00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:56.380
No?

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.447
That makes sense because
the spike's not as high.

00:43:58.447 --> 00:43:59.280
See around this guy.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.250
Compiled code, relocation.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.570
Yep, spike's not as high again.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.700
So again, deopt
is actually what's

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.950
causing the memory spike here.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.490
And then of course, that's
causing inflation in our heap.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:08.830
So we can actually see
there's a couple problems.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.730
Obviously, they're sending
too much data down the pipe.

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:11.896
This page is loading slowly.

00:44:11.896 --> 00:44:13.100
The person should feel bad.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.016
They've also got some
timers and some closures

00:44:15.016 --> 00:44:17.000
and some memory leak
issues that are causing

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.560
some friction with their users.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.695
Let's load another site.

00:44:24.406 --> 00:44:25.310
Here we go.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.620
Try this one.

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.993
Chrome always, thank you.

00:44:29.993 --> 00:44:31.660
All right, So
let's see this one.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.451
Who thinks this is
going to be a fast site?

00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:34.400
Show of hands.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.700
No hands.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.630
Good job.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.130
You win.

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.720
I like the spinner.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:41.465
We're trying to load.

00:44:41.465 --> 00:44:43.840
We're letting you know that
we don't know how to do this.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.390
Oh, sorry.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:45.200
That was below the belt.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.816
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:46.315
I'm sorry.

00:44:46.315 --> 00:44:50.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.240
COLT MCANLIS: I'm sorry.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.190
I thought it was a good idea.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.110
We see it in Gmail.

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.976
I don't know.

00:44:54.976 --> 00:44:56.350
It's kind of like,
hey, we're not

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.880
ready to figure out how
to stream content yet.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.600
We saw load.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.210
That was good.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.415
So let's do this again.

00:45:01.415 --> 00:45:04.020
Or actually, let
me show-- scrolling

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.796
doesn't seem that bad.

00:45:06.796 --> 00:45:09.510
Let's click on something.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:10.760
That was actually pretty fast.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.590
That was actually
a little too fast.

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:13.620
Hold on.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.090
Wait a minute.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.150
Let me go back.

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:17.200
OK, I'm back [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.030
Let me click on something else.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:19.014
Like, trust no one.

00:45:19.014 --> 00:45:19.930
I don't trust anybody.

00:45:22.247 --> 00:45:24.580
Wow, that actually loaded a
lot faster on the main site.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.102
Let's drill in here.

00:45:26.102 --> 00:45:26.602
Hold on.

00:45:26.602 --> 00:45:27.546
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:27.546 --> 00:45:30.230
COLT MCANLIS: No, no.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.550
Dude, you're messing it up.

00:45:33.674 --> 00:45:34.965
Jake, who's got the microphone?

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.120
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.350
COLT MCANLIS: I didn't
interrupt your talk.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:40.960
So let's take a
look at this here.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.050
So I'm going to
go to Network tab,

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:44.880
and I'm going to hit
Reload again here.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.140
Boom.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.680
We're going to take
a look at this.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.570
Let's see what's going on.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.528
So it was really weird.

00:45:49.528 --> 00:45:50.952
The main page loaded slow.

00:45:50.952 --> 00:45:51.660
That was awkward.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.470
But then all subsequent
clicks loaded actually really,

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.599
really, really
fast, which tells us

00:45:56.599 --> 00:45:58.140
if you can't get
the main page right,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.940
why are you getting
the sub clicks right?

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.230
That's kind of awkward.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:02.480
So we're still loading.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.650
We're still loading.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:04.570
We're still loading.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.130
Again, I always
sort by size, right?

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.130
Because I'm a big dude
who says that memory

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.260
is where the performance
problems are.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.801
We can actually see
that they're loading--

00:46:16.801 --> 00:46:19.420
and I'll kind of give
away the punch line here.

00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.790
But these images were on the
sub pages, not the main page.

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:27.020
But they're being
loaded on the main page.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.094
Anyone figure it out yet?

00:46:28.094 --> 00:46:29.760
Basically, what they're
doing is they're

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.450
loading all of the images
for all of the articles

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.730
that you would click to before
the main page is loaded.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.487
So they're basically
trading off.

00:46:38.487 --> 00:46:40.070
They're saying, your
initial load time

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.945
is going to be really
crummy, but every click

00:46:41.945 --> 00:46:43.490
after that's going to be golden.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.948
So they're kind of giving up
that initial three second load

00:46:45.948 --> 00:46:47.867
time to get one second
load times later.

00:46:47.867 --> 00:46:49.950
I don't know how that--
maybe that's a discussion.

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:51.200
Again, here's a WOFF.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.250
Anyone like WOFFs now?

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.431
Answer should be no.

00:46:54.431 --> 00:46:55.930
But yeah, this is
really interesting

00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:56.930
that we're seeing
some of these images.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.388
Let me see if I
can sort this again

00:46:58.388 --> 00:47:01.970
and see if we can't get
better-- here's another PNG.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.490
Again, this is not
on the main page.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:04.502
So let me hit Back here.

00:47:04.502 --> 00:47:06.710
And let me, again, let's
show you the main page here.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.160
Even clicking Back
takes some time.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.990
No?

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.350
Backie?

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:20.292
No, I guess not.

00:47:20.292 --> 00:47:21.500
AUDIENCE: You can't go there.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.510
COLT MCANLIS: We're stuck now.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.170
There we go.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.760
So yeah, notice this right here.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.810
So this was one of the
last things I clicked on,

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.184
and they have a
little drop down.

00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:33.700
So basically each one of
these items, the images

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.580
and the extra content is
loaded in the main page, not

00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.449
the subsequent page.

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:40.990
We're kind of seeing that break
down in a lot of these charts

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.490
here.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.950
So they have a couple lower
res versions here, too.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:51.830
So remember when that 100 pixel
by 100 pixel Facebook icon

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:53.000
was 9K?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.430
Here's a 320 by 180 that's 10K.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.781
So again, don't trust
your Facebook icons.

00:47:57.781 --> 00:47:59.530
I would like to say,
don't trust Facebook,

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.280
but I'm not allowed
to say that on camera.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.090
Shit.

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:04.980
Sorry.

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:06.170
Again, perfect.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.010
Here's a 320 by 180
that's exactly 9.1K.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:11.160
So again, I think all of
you should be questioning

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.060
how big your images
are, but I think

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:15.490
this Quartz site is actually
kind of an interesting case

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.680
study because they've
definitely traded off

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.725
one type of load time for
another type of load time.

00:48:21.725 --> 00:48:24.390
And I'm not really
sure why or where

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.726
the justifications of that are.

00:48:26.726 --> 00:48:28.100
But I think we
can definitely all

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.470
agree that the 20 years
that we've had on the web

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.636
have all kind of accumulated
that the initial load time is

00:48:33.636 --> 00:48:35.760
pretty much the most
important thing because that's

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.380
the first thing your user feels.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.796
None of you have seen this
site except for the one guy who

00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:42.090
submitted it, and all of you
felt the pain of this site

00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.056
loading for me hitting a button.

00:48:44.056 --> 00:48:46.430
And it doesn't matter how much
the clicks after that are.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.980
Most of us would have left the
site before we got to that.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.250
Let me go over here, too.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.300
I want to show this.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.770
So notice this--
oh, I moved now.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.030
But this YouTube image here.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.490
So if I click this
button, you'll

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.935
see the red boxes again
kind of show up here.

00:49:01.935 --> 00:49:05.720
So we can actually see that the
video-- that part of the page

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.229
is being re-rendered.

00:49:08.229 --> 00:49:10.270
So you can see again that
it's showing that the--

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.510
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:11.320
COLT MCANLIS: Nope.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:11.820
Don't care.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.150
Don't care.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.140
Nope, done.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.210
Stop.

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:16.270
Stop.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.620
Let me click.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:18.224
Done.

00:49:18.224 --> 00:49:19.640
What I'd really
like to show here,

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.800
and this isn't really showing
up on the main screen,

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.383
and I'm sorry.

00:49:22.383 --> 00:49:23.890
But can anyone see
this orange line

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.200
right here, this orange line?

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.870
So one of the other
interesting things,

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.670
there's a talk that I gave at
Google I/O this year on this.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:33.630
It's called "Web Page Design
with the GPU in Mind."

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.390
So what happens is
certain elements on a page

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.460
are kind of-- imagine
your page is a plane,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.251
and all of your images
and all of your text

00:49:40.251 --> 00:49:41.486
exist on this plane.

00:49:41.486 --> 00:49:42.860
Some of those
things are actually

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.400
propagated to its own plane so
that the web page can actually

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.420
scroll in the background,
and this other plane

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:51.310
can actually scroll
relative to it.

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.110
So this is relative
scrolling concept.

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:56.990
Let me actually show you
this on a big screen here.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:58.840
Let me load up HTML5 Rocks.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.070
And let's-- nope, I
typed in the wrong thing.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:06.880
Because I can type.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:12.625
Who's on my internet?

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:21.400
Watch my Wi-Fi go down now.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.750
We'll try that.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.140
There we go.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.330
So I'm going to pick this,
just a random article

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:30.130
with some random guy on it.

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.380
Some random, good-looking guy.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.754
I think he's pretty
good-looking.

00:50:32.754 --> 00:50:34.890
Bald is beautiful, I hear.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.700
So let's go ahead
and turn on-- this

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.880
is Chrome DevTools
on a desktop site.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.588
I know I wasn't going
to talk about this,

00:50:39.588 --> 00:50:42.520
but let's do force accelerated
and show composite layer

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:43.020
borders.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.960
So turning on layer
borders here shows us

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.160
what we're seeing normally.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:49.230
The first thing you see is
that the blue lines here

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.280
actually represent the
tiling of the page.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.310
And this orange line
actually represents

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:55.310
something that's been
promoted to its own layer.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.460
So how many of you
are using translateZ?

00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.490
TranslateZ, translate3d,
this is the hardware

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.030
accelerated fast path,
the silver bullet that

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:04.870
makes your web fast
because you're suddenly

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:06.550
using the GPU on the web.

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:07.984
It's so amazing.

00:51:07.984 --> 00:51:09.400
Actually, that's
not how it works.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.190
What happens is when you use
translateZ or translate3d,

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.830
you're actually promoting
these pieces of content

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:15.780
to its own plane.

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.655
And this is actually a
separate set of tiles.

00:51:17.655 --> 00:51:19.760
So remember how I said
the GPU will actually

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.320
scroll your tiles on the screen?

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.160
When you actually
use translateZ,

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.917
you get another layer that
the GPU also controls.

00:51:25.917 --> 00:51:28.500
Now I'm going to see if I can
do this because for some reason,

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.930
we get paused in the
debug-- too much clicking.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:38.190
So as I scroll here, notice
how these objects on the side--

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:38.820
watch this.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:41.640
The table of contents
has not orange, right?

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.360
And so once it gets
to a certain part,

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.270
it actually gets promoted
to its own layer.

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:49.550
The orange border represents
different layers in GPU memory.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.150
And then as I scroll
down the page,

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:52.390
they actually stay static.

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.899
Any time you have relative
scrolling content on your page,

00:51:54.899 --> 00:51:56.690
you're actually going
to want to promote it

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:58.900
with this translateZ
or translate3d.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.240
Now beware that this actually
puts a lot of pressure

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:01.841
on your GPU.

00:52:01.841 --> 00:52:03.340
So for all of you
who are just going

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:06.222
to start putting translateZ
on every part of your pagee--

00:52:06.222 --> 00:52:07.680
we saw this happen
a lot because it

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.240
was supposed to be
a silver bullet--

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.406
every one of these tiles,
every one of these layers,

00:52:11.406 --> 00:52:14.390
is actually contending for
residency inside of your GPU

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:15.010
cache.

00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.885
Which means the more of
these separate layers

00:52:16.885 --> 00:52:19.360
that you've actually promoted,
the slower your website

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.170
is going to be.

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:22.060
So you get an inverse
effect with it.

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.270
Because basically, your
GPU is getting overtaxed.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.362
More tiles are being
evicted from your cache,

00:52:26.362 --> 00:52:28.320
because more things are
fighting for residency.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.069
It's actually going
to slow down your site

00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:31.640
because your CPU is
spinning up more.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.223
Anyhow, enough with
the desktop stuff.

00:52:33.223 --> 00:52:34.280
Desktop's dead.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.982
No one wants desktop.

00:52:35.982 --> 00:52:37.690
OK, let's go back over
here to this thing

00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:40.782
because the mobile web is sexy.

00:52:40.782 --> 00:52:41.740
What was I showing off?

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.240
Yeah.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:44.980
So Quartz, this QZ site,
this is actually a little bit

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:51.670
interesting because we see
mostly that as we're scrolling,

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:55.090
notice the big red spots
that keep popping up.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:59.240
Let me see if I can get
it to do that again.

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.200
Yep, see it?

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.339
So something's going on.

00:53:01.339 --> 00:53:03.380
It turns out-- I'll spare
you the punchline here.

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.479
What's actually occurring
is that these guys

00:53:05.479 --> 00:53:07.520
are doing something with
a scroll handler in here

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.450
where they're actually trying
to catch what I'm doing.

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:10.670
They're trying to
catch my little scroll.

00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:12.400
They're trying to
reposition things.

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.820
And as soon as
they touch the DOM,

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.590
the whole DOM has
to be recalculated.

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.590
As soon as the whole DOM
has to be recalculated,

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.560
all of the tiles
have to be redrawn.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.230
So as soon as they try to
catch what I'm scrolling

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.490
and reposition things
manually, they're actually

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:28.010
invalidating the
hardware compositing

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:31.680
and the GPU scrolling that we're
trying to do on their behalf

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.970
and actually messing up
their entire frame rate.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.520
How many of your mobile sites
are catching a user input

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.354
like this?

00:53:38.354 --> 00:53:39.300
Yeah.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:39.970
I saw that.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:40.980
I saw that.

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.600
At least you're honest with it.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.670
Forecast.io, they know
what's going, guys.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:45.800
I got it right.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.515
I got it right.

00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:48.460
He didn't-- no,
he still hates me.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.500
That's OK.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.130
All right.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:51.620
Let's do some other websites.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.780
Pete, how are we doing on time?

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.930
15 minutes?

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:58.670
I can load all the
websites in 15 minutes.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:01.851
So let's look at a
couple other ones here.

00:54:01.851 --> 00:54:02.350
Let's see.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:04.204
Let's take a look
at something good so

00:54:04.204 --> 00:54:05.620
that everyone walks
away from here

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.840
with feelings of
happy bunny times.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.240
Sorry, I just called somebody.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.670
So this is Meetup.com.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.620
OK.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.170
So we didn't see
a loading spinner.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:22.086
That was kind of nice.

00:54:22.086 --> 00:54:24.010
But it did take a
little bit long to load.

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:26.180
In general, though,
let's see how it scrolls.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:29.930
That's actually pretty fast.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.880
Notice-- let me turn
the show-- let's

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:35.470
open the DevTools again and
see what kind of red things

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.990
are occurring and what
kind of load times

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.300
we're experiencing here.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.592
So turn on DevTools.

00:54:40.592 --> 00:54:42.675
Let's hit Reload and see
how the network performs.

00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:47.564
Not that bad, not that bad.

00:54:47.564 --> 00:54:48.980
On the device, I'm
actually seeing

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:50.420
things starting
to pop up already.

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.170
I notice no WOFFs in the code.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:52.985
That's really good.

00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:53.730
Oh, there is one.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:54.780
Son of a bitch.

00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.030
Where did that come from?

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.450
Oh, bogus.

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:01.690
Well, maybe they're not using
that on something critical.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:04.410
Let's sort by content here.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:06.250
This is really cool to see.

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:08.770
We've actually got-- a
44K JavaScript is actually

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.580
the biggest part of the page.

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:13.437
I'm surprised that's
not jQuery at 191K.

00:55:13.437 --> 00:55:15.770
How many of you are using j--
you know what, never mind.

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:16.677
Just never mind.

00:55:16.677 --> 00:55:18.760
OK, actually, this image
is popping up to the top.

00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.110
60K JPEG, 320 by 226.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:25.770
That's maybe a little large.

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:29.640
Another 60K JPEG,
another 50K JPEG.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.910
This is really interesting, too,
because we just saw 340 by 226s

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:36.380
on the previous site that
were about 10K, right?

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.202
So again, someone's not
optimizing JPEGs the right way.

00:55:40.202 --> 00:55:41.910
In fact, there's
actually, on the article

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.321
that I put on HTML5 Rocks
about image compression--

00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:46.320
let me see if I can tab
over there really quick.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:54.060
So this article that
I did was actually

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:55.685
"Image Compression
for Web Developers."

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:58.300
The entire point of this article
was to talk to all of you

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.401
in a very frank way
and kind of discuss

00:56:00.401 --> 00:56:02.400
the back story of where
image compression works.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.067
Plus I'm a really
big fan of parrots.

00:56:04.067 --> 00:56:06.650
They're kind of cool, especially
the digitally pixelated ones.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.520
Anyhow, there's some
great content down here

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.260
about JPEG information.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:13.860
And it actually shows that--
here it is, right here.

00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.430
Let me see if I
can zoom this in.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:18.370
No, too far.

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:21.290
OK, so this is actually-- I feel
it's important to kind of break

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.070
away from our regularly
scheduled bashing

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:24.330
of these websites--
because that's

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:25.400
getting a little
depressing, right?

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.608
Everyone's getting depressed?

00:56:26.608 --> 00:56:29.470
So this is actually a test
that an external person

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:34.150
did on the compression
quality of the images that

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:36.880
are being served by the
top websites in the world.

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.060
And what you're actually
seeing here is most of them

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.140
actually just use
a standard value.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.510
So all Window Live background
images are exactly 82.

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:51.580
Regardless of what the
PSNR is, they choose 82.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.300
It's hard coded.

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.410
So they might be able,
on some of the images,

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.590
to use a level 64 and
actually reduce the size more

00:56:58.590 --> 00:56:59.510
because they use 82.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:02.560
Wikipedia are all 80 for
every one of their images,

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.660
regardless of the
content quality on it.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:06.197
YouTube is about 70 to 82.

00:57:06.197 --> 00:57:07.030
That's kind of good.

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:09.410
It shows that they're actually
doing some dynamic scaling,

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:11.610
although it's unclear whether
or not it's actually manually

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.580
scaled, where they have an
artist actually changing them,

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:15.371
or they have some sort
of dynamic solution,

00:57:15.371 --> 00:57:16.160
like I was saying.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.130
Yahoo, 69 to 91.

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:20.850
Again, they may have some more
responsive version of that.

00:57:20.850 --> 00:57:22.920
Facebook's are at 85.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.387
And Google image
thumbnails are about 74.

00:57:25.387 --> 00:57:27.220
Here's the really
interesting-- Twitter user

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.365
JPEGs are anywhere
between 30 and 100,

00:57:29.365 --> 00:57:30.740
which means that
for some images,

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.830
they're actually doing nothing.

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:34.580
And some images, they're
doing everything.

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:36.310
This actually tells me-- I
don't know if anyone-- no one's

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:37.550
in here from Twitter, right?

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:40.008
This actually tells me that
they may have something dynamic

00:57:40.008 --> 00:57:42.195
actually testing the noise
ratio of the compression

00:57:42.195 --> 00:57:45.850
there and actually serving
you the most optimized JPEG

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.814
at the best image
quality possible.

00:57:47.814 --> 00:57:48.730
So that's really cool.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.396
That's really cool
to see that someone's

00:57:50.396 --> 00:57:52.280
doing that out on the web.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:55.080
OK, back to doom and gloom.

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:56.220
OK, we were over here.

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:58.350
So yeah, so these
images probably

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.180
are a little too
large in megabytes.

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.640
They're probably
not optimizing it.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.350
Chances are-- nope,
that's not an image--

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.770
chances are they're just
using a standard one.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:06.970
So let's hit Timeline.

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.960
Let's just hit Record.

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.685
Let's see what's
going on with memory.

00:58:09.685 --> 00:58:11.970
I'm not touching anything.

00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:14.320
Memory's increasing.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:18.280
Not too much, 5.5, 5.6.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:20.600
Again, we've got these
timers getting fired.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.860
Fine.js, I don't even
know what this is.

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.642
Meetup script mobile find.

00:58:24.642 --> 00:58:26.850
OK, so apparently it's trying
to meet me and find me.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:29.690
That's kind of creepy.

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:31.200
Mobile base.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:31.990
So that's weird.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.640
So they've got two
separate timers

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:36.320
coming from their own website,
doing two different things.

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.790
And again, not
touching anything.

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:43.230
Nothing's happening, nothing's
moving, but we're at 5.6 megs.

00:58:43.230 --> 00:58:44.430
So this is like a slow leak.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:48.050
It looks like there's a slow
closure or something being

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:48.930
tossed to this.

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.430
So let's take a look at this,
see if we can't drill in.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.060
Maybe we get some insights.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:51.910
Oh, yay.

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:53.160
It is a jQuery library.

00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:55.066
Can we summon the
power of pretty print?

00:58:55.066 --> 00:58:56.550
Aha.

00:58:56.550 --> 00:58:58.535
That didn't help.

00:58:58.535 --> 00:58:59.890
I'll try that again.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:01.400
There we go.

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.206
Oh, mustache.

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:05.910
Interesting.

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:06.740
Who uses mustache?

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:09.250
Can anyone explain this
line of code to me?

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:13.250
AUDIENCE: It's a JavaScript
[INAUDIBLE] derived from it.

00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:16.621
COLT MCANLIS: So this is
causing a memory leak.

00:59:16.621 --> 00:59:18.175
Can anyone fix this?

00:59:18.175 --> 00:59:18.734
Not now?

00:59:18.734 --> 00:59:19.400
OK, that's cool.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:19.780
Take your time.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:19.990
That's all right.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.094
We'll get back to it.

00:59:21.094 --> 00:59:22.510
But basically,
we're seeing again,

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:27.530
this kind of looks like
an anonymous function

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.080
calling some factory
objects, testing some object

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.090
definitions.

00:59:31.090 --> 00:59:33.010
This in and of itself
doesn't look bad,

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:37.390
although it is calling another
anonymous function down here.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:38.870
Sometimes the
pretty print spacing

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:39.911
doesn't get it all right.

00:59:39.911 --> 00:59:42.260
This might actually be sort
of a closure in a closure.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:46.550
It looks like we've got one
close there, one open here.

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.590
Something's going on.

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:50.751
Any of you who are using
third party libraries,

00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:52.750
it's actually really easy
to fall in these traps

00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:54.708
where they're allocating
memory and doing stuff

00:59:54.708 --> 00:59:57.110
on your behalf that may
be negatively impacting

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.080
your performance.

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.510
And we sometimes
ignore these faults

01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:02.050
and don't track
these faults down

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.580
because the fact we get like
event propagation or something

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.080
else.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:08.190
Like, oh, I get a callback
when something occurs.

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.540
That code you can actually
write in about 100 lines

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:13.074
of your own making and actually
keep it memory performant.

01:00:13.074 --> 01:00:14.990
But instead, we pull in
these large libraries.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.170
So it's important that
you know these trade-offs

01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:19.089
when something like
this is occurring.

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:20.130
Let's do another website.

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:22.240
Pete, we got what,
10 minutes left?

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.870
Yeah, about 10 minutes?

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.410
Let's see.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.920
What haven't we done here?

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.450
So I have to load this because
I really don't get this website.

01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:32.450
And I really want to talk
about the website more

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.910
than the performance
characteristics.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:37.616
So this is called
Game of Phones.

01:00:37.616 --> 01:00:38.475
Is this your site?

01:00:38.475 --> 01:00:39.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.480
COLT MCANLIS: OK, cool.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.360
I really don't get this website.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.262
But it's here.

01:00:45.262 --> 01:00:47.720
So we can take a look at it
from a performance perspective.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.210
Basically, what
happens is someone

01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:52.350
will record-- from
what I can tell,

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:55.950
they're like very politically
charged, angry arguments.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:58.490
And you sign up,
and someone will

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:01.120
call you and play this
recorded message that's

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.250
like, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:03.750
Rally.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.210
Fight the power.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:09.080
And then you have to call
someone else on the list

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.805
and try to regurgitate
what you heard.

01:01:11.805 --> 01:01:13.816
And so it's kind of like
the game of telephone

01:01:13.816 --> 01:01:15.190
that you play as
kids, and you're

01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:16.240
trying to get all
the way through.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.310
I have no idea why people
are even doing this.

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:20.506
Like, I hate getting calls
from my wife, much less

01:01:20.506 --> 01:01:21.880
random strangers
on the internet.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.940
I'm on the internet because
I don't want you to call me.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.840
Send me a text or something.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.522
Anyhow, personal thing.

01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:29.980
I'm sure it works
for you, brother.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.540
I don't get the internet.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.121
I'm too old.

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:31.870
That's my problem.

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.340
AUDIENCE: I've had people tell
me it's the only phone calls

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.316
that they will answer.

01:01:36.316 --> 01:01:38.292
They will answer
phone calls from this

01:01:38.292 --> 01:01:39.290
and from their mother.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:39.550
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, dude.

01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:40.570
Game of Phones, awesome.

01:01:42.682 --> 01:01:43.890
You know what you need to do?

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.490
You actually need to get the
voices from "Game of Thrones"

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:47.991
to actually do the
call, and then it

01:01:47.991 --> 01:01:49.531
would just go through
the roof, dude.

01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:50.460
HBO might sue me now.

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.534
Sorry about that.

01:01:51.534 --> 01:01:53.950
Anyhow, let's look at this
from a performance perspective.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.570
There's really
nothing on this page.

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:56.702
I mean, it's kind of text.

01:01:56.702 --> 01:01:58.410
But we're going to
run through it anyway,

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:02.250
just so you guys can kind
of see the differences

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:03.080
in these things.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.895
So am I here?

01:02:03.895 --> 01:02:05.636
OK.

01:02:05.636 --> 01:02:07.850
By the way, did you see
actually what showed up?

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:08.590
Was this on the screen?

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:09.090
Sorry.

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:10.370
So this is Game of Phones.

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:15.756
Again, it's just text,
people calling each other.

01:02:15.756 --> 01:02:18.730
But this is it.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:20.740
12 requests.

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.970
The interesting thing here
is 107K, that's a little odd.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.340
Like we're seeing some other
pages come in below that.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.720
Mainly this is coming
from a concatent.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.730
So Bootstrap is being included.

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:37.170
I'm not really sure why
this needs Bootstrap.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:44.130
I guess the cool
kids are doing it.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.255
And here's the funny thing.

01:02:45.255 --> 01:02:51.610
We got bootstrap.min and then
CSS that replaces Bootstrap.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:52.570
So that's a thing.

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:53.236
And then jQuery.

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:03.810
And here's another Bootstrap
again, and then telephone-gram

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:04.975
and then another jQuery.

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.822
Are you using two jQueries?

01:03:10.822 --> 01:03:12.571
AUDIENCE: I should
mention that I've never

01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:13.790
made a web page before.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.030
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:17.430
You're using two jQueries.

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:19.079
Do you know you're
using two jQueries?

01:03:19.079 --> 01:03:19.870
AUDIENCE: Now I do.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:20.911
COLT MCANLIS: Now you do.

01:03:20.911 --> 01:03:23.220
OK.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:26.160
And then I like the GIF, right?

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.104
It's sprite sheeted, I guess.

01:03:29.104 --> 01:03:30.020
Here's the cool thing.

01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:34.680
So a 300 by 120 animated
GIF is only 4.4K,

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.360
yet we were seeing like full
JPEGs that were like 9K that

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.490
were static, right?

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.890
So I'm not really sure
what else do with this.

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:47.221
Let me hit Timeline and see
what this is doing here.

01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:48.595
This is kind of
a little awkward.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.930
So your jQueries
are using memory.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.297
So this is kind of telltale.

01:03:58.297 --> 01:03:59.130
Do you have a timer?

01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:00.690
It looks like you
have a timer on your--

01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:02.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], maybe
the audio player is using it.

01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:04.361
COLT MCANLIS: Maybe
the audio player.

01:04:04.361 --> 01:04:05.780
Yeah, it looks
like yeah, it does.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.220
So it looks like
there's a timer here.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:08.803
I don't know if you
guys can see this.

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.730
It looks like
there's a timer here.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.660
And you can see this red square
up here, just the Play button.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:18.090
Just like that Play
button has a timer that

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:22.210
needs jQuery and Boostrap--
two jQueries and Bootstrap--

01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:27.790
and is allocating like a meg of
memory over like seven seconds.

01:04:27.790 --> 01:04:29.310
So that's a thing.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.370
Lots of rasterizes
occurring in here.

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:32.570
Lots of recalculates.

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.420
So not only is it
repainting, it's

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.390
actually like updating
the DOM to repaint.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:38.700
Let's look at this again.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.330
That's updating the DOM.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:41.972
Don't know why.

01:04:41.972 --> 01:04:43.680
Maybe there's a cool
jitter effect there.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.440
You know what?

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:44.970
Maybe I got this wrong.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:46.678
Maybe I'm actually
looking at the Matrix.

01:04:46.678 --> 01:04:48.165
Am I looking at the Matrix?

01:04:48.165 --> 01:04:49.290
That would be kind of cool.

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.105
I'm like-- sorry.

01:04:51.105 --> 01:04:51.730
I'm having fun.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.521
It's late, and I have
to keep you all awake

01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:54.960
for like another five minutes.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.340
So anyhow, I don't
like this trend.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.324
You're actually allocating
more memory faster

01:04:59.324 --> 01:05:00.990
than the other websites
we looked at it.

01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:01.850
It's probably because
you have two jQueries,

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.371
but anyhow, let's dig in.

01:05:03.371 --> 01:05:04.370
So let's go to profiles.

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:06.570
Again, follow the memory,
find the performance problems.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.080
So we follow the asset
memory to figure out

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.137
where load problems are.

01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:10.720
We follow dynamic
memory to figure out

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.678
where compute problems
and render problems are.

01:05:12.678 --> 01:05:14.830
Can I click this button, please?

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:15.870
Clicky.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:19.240
You've allocated too much
memory for your site,

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.170
and I can't click.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:20.970
Oh, there we go.

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:21.580
OK.

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.740
So let's do record heap
allocations, hit Start.

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.680
So that's kind of interesting.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:28.920
You guys see this pattern?

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.400
So this is actually really very,
very regular allocations that

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.130
are occurring, two
different sets of it,

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.920
but they're almost
deleted immediately,

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.400
except for the
stuff that happened

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.170
at the beginning of the trace.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:40.710
So we're seeing the grey lines.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:43.376
So the grey lines mean that what
was allocated has actually been

01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:44.050
freed now.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.910
This is kind of odd.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:48.270
I kind of want to see
where this is coming from.

01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:52.005
I like to dig in and
figure out why I'm so bald.

01:05:52.005 --> 01:05:53.880
So we have the whole
thing, yada, yada, yada.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.370
Let's actually just
highlight this guy here.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.810
So array, what's--
transition array.

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:00.930
So something's going
on inside of V8.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:02.660
All these are being deleted.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:03.850
Compiled code.

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.420
Is this a deopt?

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.310
No, relocation info.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:10.010
So it looks like there's
just some sort of cases

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.760
where jQuery is executing--
and again, I see this a lot

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.450
with closures.

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:15.825
Closures, for some reason,
tend to bring up this pattern.

01:06:15.825 --> 01:06:17.380
jQuery's kicking
off a closure that's

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:23.290
causing a reflow of your entire
page for like a five pixel

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.480
by five pixel icon.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.830
So you still loaded faster
than the other sites.

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:28.520
Bravo.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.038
Round of applause for that.

01:06:30.038 --> 01:06:31.014
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:31.014 --> 01:06:32.966
AUDIENCE: Real web
pages don't need images.

01:06:32.966 --> 01:06:33.454
COLT MCANLIS: Say again?

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:35.410
AUDIENCE: Real web
pages don't need images.

01:06:35.410 --> 01:06:36.944
COLT MCANLIS: There you go.

01:06:36.944 --> 01:06:39.212
You know, I'm a fan
of the text web.

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:41.670
That requires drinking to get
more information out of that.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:43.310
Anyhow, let's load
up another one.

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:44.190
Pete, how are we doing on time?

01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:45.200
AUDIENCE: You've
got five minutes.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:45.850
COLT MCANLIS: Five more minutes.

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:46.050
OK.

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:48.110
Let's clear up quickly,
because I'm actually

01:06:48.110 --> 01:06:50.640
really interested to try this
Robitussin and whiskey thing.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.395
I think we may have
something on there.

01:06:52.395 --> 01:06:53.850
AUDIENCE: I highly recommend it.

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:54.680
COLT MCANLIS: OK.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.830
Let's try-- here we go.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:58.860
Let's try this CBN Week.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.707
And we're done.

01:07:12.707 --> 01:07:14.290
I think at this time,
I don't actually

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:16.081
need to tell you guys
what I'm about to do.

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:20.580
This is-- no, I don't
want to translate.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.038
I used to be able
to speak Chinese.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.830
It was a beautiful language.

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.247
So you kind of know
what I'm about to do.

01:07:26.247 --> 01:07:27.580
I'm going to load up networking.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.120
I'm going to see what images
are too large, what JavaScript

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.660
is too large, what you're using
that you shouldn't be using.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:34.200
We're going to
try to cull assets

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.400
and get rid of
extra network loads.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.240
I thought the points
about sprite sheets

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.230
was perfect earlier.

01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:41.020
By the way, they shouldn't
be called sprite sheets.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.270
They should be called atlases.

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.700
You should actually see my
Udacity course rant on this.

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.250
Everywhere else in the
world, in video games,

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.855
in film and everything,
we call them atlases.

01:07:49.855 --> 01:07:50.910
You know what?

01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:51.890
Never mind.

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:53.760
Anyhow, let's see
some scrolling.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.140
Not that bad.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.840
Let's head over to DevTools.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.090
Let's take a look at this
under the microscope, right?

01:08:02.544 --> 01:08:03.585
Let's go back to network.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.720
My computer said, I'm done.

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:13.370
All right.

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:14.340
This wil be the last
site, and then we'll

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.290
actually get to
all the questions.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.359
And I think we're going
to do a group question.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:17.880
Right?

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.939
Fantastic.

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:23.859
So that's interesting.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:28.483
So there's already 89
requests, 92 requests, 93, 95.

01:08:31.261 --> 01:08:35.050
1.5 megs transferred so far.

01:08:35.050 --> 01:08:38.470
1.9-- 2 megs.

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:39.676
2.195.

01:08:39.676 --> 01:08:41.220
Let's see if we
can go [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.890
So here's something
interesting up here.

01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:46.036
So notice this grey
bar right here.

01:08:46.036 --> 01:08:48.410
So in Chrome DevTools, when
you look at this Network tab,

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:49.869
basically, you see two values.

01:08:49.869 --> 01:08:51.410
You see sort of this
semi-transparent

01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:53.770
and then this opaque
portion of these items.

01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:55.700
That semi-transparent
value is actually

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.354
how long the browser spent
waiting to receive the asset.

01:08:59.354 --> 01:09:01.770
This is one of the reasons
that sprite sheets are actually

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.819
so important for you, because
each browser has a set

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:06.580
number of limits
of open connections

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:08.450
that it will allow
to a single server.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:11.060
For Chrome, I believe
it's around six.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.330
Which means if you have
six requests in flight,

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.689
it'll block the rest of the
requests until a slot opens up.

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.752
Think of it like a
caching FIFO or whatnot.

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:22.210
And so Chrome actually shows
you this here on the timeline.

01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:24.430
You can see some of
these actually waited

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.091
a very, very long time.

01:09:26.091 --> 01:09:27.590
In this case, it
was actually spent,

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:31.090
what is this, 471
milliseconds waiting.

01:09:31.090 --> 01:09:33.080
It wanted to request
this asset, but it

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.790
couldn't because there were
other things in the pipe.

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:37.248
And you can kind of see that
this is a function of the fact

01:09:37.248 --> 01:09:40.830
that there's about 100 requests
and 3.6 megs transferred.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.390
For those of you who don't
know, the average website

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.409
size right now, according
to HTTP Archive,

01:09:45.409 --> 01:09:47.352
is about 1.1 megs.

01:09:47.352 --> 01:09:48.310
And that's for desktop.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:49.890
They haven't really got into
a lot of the mobile testing

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:50.670
just yet.

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:53.899
But obviously, mobile
shouldn't be 1.1 meg, right?

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.849
So obviously, there's
too big a content here.

01:09:55.849 --> 01:09:57.640
So let's see if there
is any big offenders.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.056
Let's see if images
are a problem.

01:09:59.056 --> 01:10:00.855
Who thinks images are a problem?

01:10:00.855 --> 01:10:02.190
AUDIENCE: Show of hands.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:05.900
COLT MCANLIS:
There's a 300K image.

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.720
200K, 197K, 161K.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.340
152K.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.530
What is in that image?

01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.140
I think that's bigger than raw.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.060
Yeah.

01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:21.811
Yeah, obviously, these
images are too big.

01:10:21.811 --> 01:10:22.976
They're not being optimized.

01:10:22.976 --> 01:10:23.990
They should be fixed.

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:25.240
Let's take a look at timeline.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.430
Let's see if anything is
going on with memory here.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:28.054
Anything crazy?

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.100
Slow.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.230
Again, timer.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.700
We see this same pattern.

01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:37.560
So we see almost
all of these pages

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.010
are falling into
the same pattern.

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:41.460
Also, almost all of these
pages, and some of them,

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.840
in rare cases, are all using
jQuery or jQuery twice.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.580
Closures are being passed
off to timers for things

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.430
like ads or analytics
or marquees.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:53.190
And this seems to
be a common pattern.

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:55.640
But this is obviously is
causing a lot of memory

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.361
and a lot of churn and some
other weird things going on.

01:10:58.361 --> 01:10:59.860
I can look at the
frames times here.

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.151
And so let me actually do this.

01:11:01.151 --> 01:11:03.260
I don't know if I showed
you guys this tool.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.700
Nope, cancel.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.636
So as I'm scrolling here--
it's not picking that up.

01:11:10.636 --> 01:11:11.541
OK.

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:12.040
Never mind.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.210
I won't show you that tool.

01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:16.190
Anyhow, let's be done
with this for the evening

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.680
because I think Pete has
some other stuff he wants

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.630
to talk to you
guys about tonight.

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:24.340
So thank you for
your time tonight.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.440
Perfmatters.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.190
Wait, wait, wait.

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:28.960
I'll let you start
the clap in a second.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.910
So here's how you
get a hold of me.

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:34.050
If you guys, if anything today
was controversial or something

01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:35.550
worth tweeting or
something you just

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:37.690
want to ask more questions
about, go ahead and find me.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:39.850
Make sure you join the Google+
Web Performance community.

01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:40.940
There's a lot of
great stuff there.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:42.610
Please, for the love of
god, use #perfmatters.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:43.500
Follow #perfmatters.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.400
It's a brand.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.910
You should wear this at work.

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:50.600
Everything you do, you should
be challenging your employees,

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.330
your managers, the
owners of your company,

01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:55.540
#perfmatters,
#perfmatters, #perfmatters.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.870
It's going to be the
thing that separates

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:00.590
the billion-dollar
companies from everybody

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.202
else on the mobile
web in the next year.

01:12:03.202 --> 01:12:04.160
In fact, it already is.

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.990
It's already [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:07.050
Challenge everyone.

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:08.841
Hold them to the
standards of #perfmatters.

01:12:08.841 --> 01:12:10.390
Now you can start the clap.

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.890
Yes.

01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:11.790
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.940
COLT MCANLIS: Thank
you for your time.
