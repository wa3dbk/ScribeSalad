ADDY OSMANI: Hey guys, we are
live on the Chrome Developer

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.420
channel for the Chrome
Office Hours.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.190
I think it will be useful for us
to go around the room just

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.146
to see who everybody is.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:16.482
Paul?

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.530
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, I'm Paul,
as Addy just said.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.060
I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820
I've worked Chrome,
Web Intents.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.810
And I'm looking forward
to loads of Web

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.750
Intents questions today.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.980
I don't see any on the list.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.830
I'm want you to come and ask
some, otherwise I probably

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.965
won't be speaking today.

00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:34.200
Sorry, guys.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.340
PAUL LEWIS: Hey,I'm
Paul Lewis.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.680
I'm a developer programs
engineer for Google,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.590
obviously, working on Chrome,
Chrome apps, GPU, and

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.420
performance kinds of things.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.200
ADDY OSMANI: I'm Addy.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.472
I work on Yeoman tooling, some
developer docs, and one two

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:50.485
other bits.

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.050
PAUL IRISH: I'm Paul Irish.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.064
Paul.

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:59.497
I'm working on all sorts of
HTML5, openware platform, dev

00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:04.274
tools, Yeoman, good stuff.

00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:06.212
SAM DUTTON: My name
is Sam Dutton.

00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:10.820
I'm here in London working on
Chrome devrel, I'll be working

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.221
on WebRTC, and doing more
mobile Chrome stuff.

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:22.950
PAUL IRISH: So we have a Google
moderator setup that

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.610
you can go and submit questions
to and vote up and

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.450
down on other people's questions
so that we answer

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.370
exactly the stuff that you
are interested in.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.850
So if you can, just
open up the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.270
developers.google.com/live,
and you'll see

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.200
that we're on air.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.630
Click through that, and then
you'll see the moderator right

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.350
there, where you can submit
questions and put things up.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.320
So this is just Office Hours,
and we're just going to answer

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.090
your questions.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.505
So we're guided by
you guys today.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.270
SAM DUTTON: We're planning to
do this on a pretty regular

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.060
basis from London now, so we're
really looking forward

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.860
to more of your questions.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.535
ADDY OSMANI: So let's dive in.

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:07.785
PAUL LEWIS: Cool.

00:02:12.134 --> 00:02:16.710
The first question that we're
going to get into comes from

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.956
the United Kingdom
from Simon Owen.

00:02:18.956 --> 00:02:24.950
He asked, are we going to see
a FireSass equivalent or

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.466
similar in Chrome?

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:33.210
And so he's talking about the
FireSass extension for FireBug

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.100
adding in support of the Sass
stylesheet [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.030
So we've been looking at this
and really want to have some

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.430
good, powerful stuff.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.930
There's a patch that's
brewing.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.360
It has not landed yet, as a
straw-man attempt, where you

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.845
can actually see Sass files
inside the Sources panel in

00:02:57.845 --> 00:03:00.000
the Chrome dev tools.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580
And so that's the first step.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.240
We'll see where it
goes from there.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.480
But we're investigating and
writing Chrome right now.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.202
PAUL KINLAN: So are you going
to use source maps?

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:18.620
PAUL LEWIS: As far as I know,
it's not actually using source

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.760
maps just yet.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.980
Although the cool thing
is that the original

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.300
implementation of source maps
was refactored to allow for

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.910
more flexibility when it came
to CSS source maps.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.260
So while what's implemented
right now is not taking

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.340
advantage of that, there's
plumbing to enable that.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.190
So that patch will actually
land today or tomorrow.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.180
So if you're on Canary,
you'll be able to see

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.330
the begins of that.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.400
The other thing I wanted to
mention is if you Google for

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.740
Web Inspector Commits RSS,
you're going to get an RSS

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.140
feed of all the commits to
WebKit that are just the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.410
WebKit Inspector, which
is from dev tools.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.510
And you can see everything
that lands, including new

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.280
features and small bug fixes and
stay very close to what's

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.566
coming down the pipe.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.220
Next question?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.320
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.220
Moving on to a question here
from [INAUDIBLE], are you

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.420
planning to make Chrome desktop
sharing extensions

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.800
support voice chat, work around
firewalls so we can

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.700
interact with our site users
like with Skype, but totally

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.620
over the web?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.480
Well, none of us here work
on that extension.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.092
We have passed the question
on to the team.

00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:48.590
I'd like to take this
opportunity to give a plug for

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.863
WebRTC, which does a lot of
what you're talking about.

00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:55.260
I've said already.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.600
It allows video chat and enables
NAT traversal, so

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.970
getting through firewalls
and so on.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.620
So take a look at that.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.630
We've got a great WebRTC
article now on

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.700
HTML5 rocks dot com.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.950
We'll have a little
on webrtc.org.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.110
Great way to chat with people,
and it's all in the browser,

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.586
plug-in free.

00:05:19.586 --> 00:05:22.790
PAUL KINLAN: So that would be
for his screensharing as well.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.600
So you are talking about doing
WebRTC at the same time as

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.070
screenshare?

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.390
SAM DUTTON: I'm not sure if
the question here is about

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.475
doing video chat or specifically
about doing

00:05:31.475 --> 00:05:33.030
desktop sharing.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.220
We'll ask the promoting
team about working--

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.500
PAUL KINLAN: Because I've seen
some stuff that use the

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.740
Mutation Observers as well to
get the screen on someone

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.990
else's remote screen.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.170
PAUL IRISH: Next question
comes from [? Keviex ?]

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.500
in the United States.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.250
He says, a question regarding
V8 flags in Chrome.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.640
So there's a lot of flags that
you can pass into the V8

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.580
Javascript engine that allow
you to implement tracing.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.030
And this is actually
pretty cool.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.400
In a very high performance
environment, you want to know

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.430
when it goes into Crankshaft,
which is

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.040
the optimize compiler.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.000
And you can see what goes into
that heavily optimized route

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.850
and then back out and, perhaps,
get an indication of

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.244
your code that is keeping it
from going into a highly

00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:29.720
optimized route.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.860
There's a great talk, I think,
at Google I/O about V8 and

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.462
optimization, where you can
learn more about this.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.290
But [? Keviex ?] is asking, can
anyone give instructions

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.590
on using these flags inside
Chrome to get this?

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.390
So for this one, Chrome has
flags that you can run against

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.980
the executable.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.080
So if you just Google
for running

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.060
Chrome flags, I think--

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.910
a while ago I made a page that
has the instructions.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.960
Basically, you need to run
Chrome from the command line,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.160
and then you can
pass in flags.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.295
Every available flag is
listed on peter.sh.

00:07:13.295 --> 00:07:16.340
So if you just look for
that, you can find it.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.210
But there's a specific technique
of passing in V8

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.910
flags through a Chrome flag.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.700
So it's like you wrap the
V8 flags in a warm

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.640
hug of other flags.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.250
SAM DUTTON: So you can
do it from Chrome

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.080
flags, in other words?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.040
PAUL IRISH: You can do it.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.690
So the name of the Chrome
flag is V8 Flags.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.160
And you pass it a string
of other flags.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.856
Yeah, that's nice.

00:07:42.856 --> 00:07:46.390
But that way you are able to
get this output dumped into

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.662
your terminal, as far
as V8's behavior.

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.410
PAUL KINLAN: So are there
any tools that

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.000
consume that output?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.452
Or is it, literally, your
just go in and?

00:07:54.452 --> 00:07:56.860
PAUL IRISH: I haven't
seen any.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.680
That would be really cool.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.930
I haven't seen it.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.094
Next question.

00:08:10.094 --> 00:08:11.860
SAM DUTTON: Wow, we got some
more questions coming in.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.020
PAUL IRISH: Good, keep
them coming.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:13.550
SAM DUTTON: Yeah,
fire them in.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.460
PAUL IRISH: Please, vote
up and down on

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.195
anybody else's questions.

00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.990
PAUL KINLAN: I've seen someone
mention Web Intents.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.273
SAM DUTTON: We got get
him more questions.

00:08:19.273 --> 00:08:20.630
PAUL KINLAN: We'll do that
one later, alright?

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.770
I'll save them for last.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.970
SAM DUTTON: The last question
is a good one.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.490
PAUL IRISH: Are there any known
IDE or tools to take

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.870
advantage of remote debugging
support API to enhance web

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.590
developer resources?

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.840
So this cool.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.530
One of the extension APIs inside
Chrome is actually

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.450
called the Debugger API.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.090
And this is actually a JSON feed
of the remote debugging

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.705
protocol that is used for remote
debugging and also,

00:08:53.705 --> 00:08:56.530
actually, for the Web Inspector
application in the

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.830
web app, just to communicate
with the host page.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.470
So it actually just communicates
over the same

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.320
protocol that it uses for
remote debugging.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.560
And that protocol is exposed
via an extension.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.490
What this allows is you could
create, in a page, your own

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.420
complete API--

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.570
I'm sorry, UI, for all
of Chrome dev tools.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.540
One particularly great
application is, let's say, you

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.770
have a web based IDE.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.025
You could be showing code, and
then you have your set

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:35.040
breakpoint, pause, step into,
step out of, and all that

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.240
would be proxied through
the dev tools plumbing.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.990
And you get to control the
API inside the UI.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.720
So it's really exciting.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.490
And as far as people who are
taking advantage of this right

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.960
now, there is a plug-in for
Eclipse that allows you to

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.230
debug your JavaScripts over in
Eclipse and it just routes

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.130
through them and uses the
debugger protocol.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.660
And that's, I think,
it these days.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.595
Adobe has a new web based
IDE called Brackets.

00:10:07.595 --> 00:10:10.720
And I've talked to them
about this API.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.900
And so they've looked at it.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.460
Nothing has landed
as far as I know.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.403
But it could be pretty
rad if we saw an

00:10:18.403 --> 00:10:18.756
implementation there.

00:10:18.756 --> 00:10:22.840
PAUL KINLAN: So is the
protocol over TCP?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.295
PAUL IRISH: Yeah.

00:10:24.295 --> 00:10:25.270
PAUL KINLAN: Interesting.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.100
I was just thinking because,
obviously, Chrome Apps, the

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.660
packaged apps, have got access
to UDP and TCP connections.

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.780
So you can make a little Chrome
App like, right now, on

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.090
the Dev and Canary channel,
which would talk to the

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.130
instance of Chrome and have a
debugger inside your own web

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.422
app type of thing.

00:10:43.422 --> 00:10:45.990
PAUL IRISH: I think it's
actually a WebSocket

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.395
connection.

00:10:46.395 --> 00:10:47.820
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, is that
a WebSocket one?

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.760
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.210
There's actually a great article
if you're interested

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.340
in extending the dev tools.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:58.610
There's a really good article
by our colleague Boris Smus.

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.930
If you Google for
extending Chrome

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.320
Developer Tools Boris Smus--

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.570
that's S-M-U-S--

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.980
that's a really great place
to learn about building

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.580
extensions for the
Chrome tools.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.690
But also, if you want to
actually add stuff to your own

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.740
custom frontend.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.104
So good information there
about doing extra

00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:18.360
things for the tools.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.540
PAUL KINLAN: Is that
like extra panels

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.280
and stuff as well?

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.280
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.280
It's actually information about
building a new frontend

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.910
or tweaking, adding on to
the existing frontend.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.560
There's good information there
about building extensions

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.535
using the dev tools
extensions, APIs.

00:11:34.535 --> 00:11:35.938
PAUL KINLAN: Because we'll have
to do a Web Intents--

00:11:35.938 --> 00:11:37.402
I'm going to mention Web Intents
every single time.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:45.550
It's the Web Intent that I
write that [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.500
Because we're thinking about
doing like a dev tools custom

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.423
panel to tell you what
information was being passed

00:11:51.423 --> 00:11:53.691
into an app [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:53.691 --> 00:11:55.610
ADDY OSMANI: So the next
question is, how will the

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.620
divergence of the W3C and
WHATWG on the HTML5 spec

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.250
affect Chrome?

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.875
And I guess the answer to that
is, it won't really.

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:07.470
We're actively involved
in both.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.910
And we're hoping that the
differences there are going to

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.292
stay minor.

00:12:12.292 --> 00:12:15.600
PAUL IRISH: The other thing to
point out is that the Chrome

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.040
team is involved in working
groups on the

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.420
W3C, also the WHATWG.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.140
This is not the first time
that there's been a

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.380
divergence.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:36.840
For instance, inside the WHATWG
HTML spec, it includes

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.120
the Canvas 2D API.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:45.580
But that is in its very own
spec over in W3C land.

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.080
And there's wording differences
and things like

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.890
that already.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.140
So there has been
a divergence.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:54.610
Well, I don't know if it's
more of a divergence, but

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.900
there is new editors as well.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:03.910
We expect not much of an effect
at all on how Chrome

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.160
operates and is developed.

00:13:08.072 --> 00:13:11.120
ADDY OSMANI: So the next
question is, as the Web SQL

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.270
feature was deprecated from
HTML5 spec, are you planning

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.200
to remove it from Chrome
in the future?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.600
Web SQL is interesting.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.460
Dropping it from the web
platform is difficult, because

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.600
there are people actively
using it at the moment.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.220
And if we want to do that, one
prerequisite is that things

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.660
like IndexDB, for example, get
broader support and start

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.240
getting used a little
bit more.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.687
We do see Web SQL, perhaps,
getting dropped at sometime in

00:13:35.687 --> 00:13:39.580
the foreseeable future, but,
again, people need to start

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.310
using IndexDB, for example,
a little bit more.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.900
PAUL KINLAN: So the question I
was going to ask is, do we

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:51.330
know of any abstraction layers
which just get rid of the

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.475
differences between the two, I
mean, that we can kind of tell

00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:55.130
people right now?

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.700
PAUL IRISH: Between Web
SQL and IndexDB?

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.300
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah,
so don't have to

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.050
particularly worry too much.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.990
I mean, if you're going to
develop an app now, and you

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.630
want just to store later?

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.150
SAM DUTTON: Right, you
mean like Lawnchair

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.910
and stuff like that.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.845
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:14:04.845 --> 00:14:07.860
I mean, Lawnchair, Data Backbone
has got these couple

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.040
different plug-ins--

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.620
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, there are
a bunch of different sync

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.780
plug-ins for Backbone that you
can get that allow you to

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.675
switch the storage options that
you use, whether it be

00:14:15.675 --> 00:14:17.910
IndexDB or something else.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.354
But as Sam mentioned, there's
also Lawnchair, which a lot of

00:14:21.354 --> 00:14:22.290
people are using
at the moment.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.040
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, in a way it's
tricky, because Lawnchair

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.170
has asynchronous API, as
far as I remember.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.795
You want to have a asynchronous
API, because the

00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:37.206
browser likes when you're
acting in an

00:14:37.206 --> 00:14:38.456
asynchronous fashion.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.230
And so if you want something
that's like simple and has

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.840
great browser support, just
use local storage.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.460
And if you're going to go a
little bit more complicated

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.540
than that, and you need better
performance, and you need

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.690
better data consistency, you
might end up writing the

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.940
adapters yourself.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.940
But I don't like recommending
that.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.070
PAUL LEWIS: Got to be
driving the market.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.140
ADDY OSMANI: You can post a
response to questions inside

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.080
the moderator.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.010
If you have a suggestion for a
storage library that handles

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.100
Web SQL and IndexDB and,
hopefully, is also

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.890
asynchronous, drop it in there,
because it's hard to

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.680
capture all the possible
libraries there.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:36.065
Simon Sarris, who is a Canvas
expert in New Hampshire, he

00:15:36.065 --> 00:15:40.580
asked about scrollbars.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:46.250
So in Chrome, when you do a
Control F find you get little

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.830
highlights on the scrollbar to
indicate page position, where

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.850
all the matches are.

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.260
And sometimes, when you
customize the scrollbar with

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.040
CSS, that effect is lost.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:01.970
So he's asking, do we get to
retain that functionality,

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:05.420
somehow, while still having
customer styling on

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.870
scrollbars?

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.700
Great question.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.070
PAUL KINLAN: Do we
know an answer?

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.230
Because I was just think--

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.538
do we?

00:16:14.538 --> 00:16:14.972
No?

00:16:14.972 --> 00:16:15.840
No answer.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.780
Because I was thinking
about this.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.685
I remember doing something like
this a while ago where,

00:16:18.685 --> 00:16:23.290
in custom CSS, you could,
basically, just manipulate it

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.920
with the Canvas, essentially,
like the background.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.728
It wasn't necessarily a
background image, but you

00:16:28.728 --> 00:16:29.590
could, essentially, attach
the Canvas to it.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.425
And I can't remember, for the
life of me, how I did it.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:35.370
But because the scrollbars in
WebKit are startable, and you

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.510
can get access to the thumb, the
background, and the little

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.880
bits at the top and bottom, I
was wondering whether you do

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.560
the same type of thing
there as well.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.600
The height and width, you can
get the Canvas and say, well,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.178
the background image for this
scrollbar is the output from

00:16:50.178 --> 00:16:51.428
this Canvas.

00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:54.930
I've not seen it done.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:59.291
Well, I've seen it done in other
apps, but I've never

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:00.380
seen the solution, if
that makes sense

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.680
PAUL IRISH: I feel like it's a
totally legit feature request

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.920
to ask for custom styling
for the match

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.910
markers in the scrollbar.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:15.030
If we have a styling
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:20.540
like -WebKit -scrollbar -match,
or whatever, and then

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.670
you might take it from that
yellow and change it into

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.740
something that matches what
you've styled it into.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.349
If we had that then there would
be no reason to hide it

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.290
automatically when it styles.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:37.710
And so file a ticket and see
what folks think, because I

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.454
think that would be awesome.

00:17:40.454 --> 00:17:44.150
PAUL LEWIS: So the next question
from Stewart is, will

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.350
Chrome for Android follow a
similar frequent release

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.490
schedule to the desktop
version?

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.250
And are there any plans for
dev and Canary versions?

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.190
The simple answer is, yes, we
intend to follow the Chrome

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.960
release cycle, but we don't
have an ETA for this,

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.890
specifically, at the moment.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.420
When we do, we'll announce
it publicly.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.830
But what we can say is that we
will be following the dev beta

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:14.395
stable Canary release pattern
that you've seen on desktop.

00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:17.020
ADDY OSMANI: So the next
question is, are you planning,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.586
soon, to implement the device
orientation locking by the

00:18:19.586 --> 00:18:23.620
view port orientation preview
in the Chrome mobile and

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.870
Android default browser?

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.190
So we're investigating what APIs
are important to have on

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.210
mobile at the moment.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.750
That includes the orientation
lock.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.950
We're aware of it We're looking
at it at the moment.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.700
But we don't have anything
to announce just yet.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.572
I know it's not the best
answer, but it's what

00:18:41.572 --> 00:18:42.822
you get right now.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.660
Yeah.

00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:54.550
PAUL IRISH: Stewart asks
do you know of any work

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:59.960
implementing the Web Audio API
for Chrome for Android?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.110
Web Audio API is used in--

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.520
was it used in Exquisite
Forest?

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:04.960
Yeah.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.520
PAUL KINLAN: It was used
in the WebChrome

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.100
mobile app as well.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.880
PAUL IRISH: The new Chrome
[INAUDIBLE] was for Forest,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:12.940
which I recently released,
experiments and arty stuff.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.010
It's really cool.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.720
And it's not currently
available

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.320
in Chrome for Android.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.710
What you can do is, if you go to
mcrbug.com, it's a list of

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.140
all the tickets that are filed
against Chrome for Android.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.830
And one of them in there,
towards the top, you'll see,

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.060
is Web Audio support.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.620
Star this ticket to
stay notified.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.290
Right now, there's
not any support.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.100
One of the things that would be
really useful to hear is,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.230
if you're a mobile developer,
and you could really use Web

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.020
Audio support, and you just said
the audio tag doesn't cut

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.990
it for you, leave a not saying
what your use case is.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.680
What is that you want to build,
so people have a better

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:01.150
idea as far as what is the
possibility of this feature?

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.870
I've heard a lot of people say
that Web Audio API makes a lot

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:09.700
sense in desktop settings, but
on a phone or a tablet, it's

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.540
not as obvious.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.590
So having a broader
understanding of what people

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.370
are going to make would help a
lot as far as helping people

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.672
understand the priority
of this should be.

00:20:21.672 --> 00:20:25.510
SAM DUTTON: If you're in London,
go to the Science

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.380
Museum and check out--

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.380
PAUL KINLAN: You know, I should
have said that, man.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.230
SAM DUTTON: Paul's your man--

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.085
PAUL KINLAN: Check out the
Science Museum, Chrome Weblab.

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:32.800
It's awesome.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.320
SAM DUTTON: It's really nice.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.120
PAUL IRISH: What is it?

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.410
PAUL KINLAN: It's five, real
world, interactive

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.570
experiments, Chrome experiments
that you can

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.520
interact with from anywhere
in the world on the web or

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.490
interact with directly from
the Science Museum.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:45.090
There's an interactive
orchestra, sand drawing box,

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.990
which you take a picture
of your face,

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.470
draw it in the sand.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.410
You have to go check it out.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.130
It's really cool.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:51.900
It's beautiful as all.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.970
PAUL LEWIS: In the meantime,
if you can't,

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.192
chromeweblab.com, would
be the place to visit.

00:20:56.192 --> 00:20:59.010
PAUL IRISH: We went there
just last night.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.590
And it was totally cool.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.690
Got an understanding of how
everything was built, all

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.970
built with Chrome and web
technologies, even some

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.910
Node.js and Arduino in there.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.890
PAUL KINLAN: So we'll do some
Hangouts, as well, soon, with

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.200
some of the people who have
built the project.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.980
I've haven't got an exact ETA
when it's going to happen.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.915
ADDY OSMANI: Are they going to
talk us through how these

00:21:15.915 --> 00:21:16.471
things were used?

00:21:16.471 --> 00:21:20.690
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, we want to
do one talk per experiment,

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.982
from top to bottom, from client
to server, show you how

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:24.515
it was built.

00:21:24.515 --> 00:21:25.345
PAUL IRISH: So neat.

00:21:25.345 --> 00:21:28.232
PAUL KINLAN: It's
going to be fun.

00:21:28.232 --> 00:21:33.070
PAUL IRISH: Next question, Simon
asks about some of the

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.040
new Canvas functionality that's
been added to the spec.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.170
I think this happened circa
March, April, is when it

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.680
actually hit the spec.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.950
There's new functionality
and features for

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.740
Canvas that are in there.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.050
But I don't think we've seen
it in any browser yet.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.876
As far as ETA, I can't say.

00:21:55.876 --> 00:21:57.720
I just don't know.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.120
But the best way to check this
out on the WebKit tracker.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.560
So what I just did is I
just looked up one of

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.550
these, found a ticket.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:11.050
Right now it's assigned to Gene
Jackson, who is commonly

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.450
a spec editor for
a lot of specs.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.960
And he has a lot of them
assigned to him.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.260
So it looks like there's
certainly interest from

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.820
implementers.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.660
But I haven't seen any
patches prepared yet,

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.740
so watch the tickets.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.198
And that's as much as
we know right now.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.750
If you're just joining
us, hello.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.030
We are going through a
bunch of questions.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.220
You go to
developers.google.com/live,

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:47.170
click on are Chrome Office
Hours, and there's a bunch of

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.870
questions you can vote
up, down, and ask.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.610
PAUL KINLAN: There are
quite a few now.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.045
It's good.

00:22:52.045 --> 00:22:56.540
PAUL IRISH: Vote up
and down more.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.190
Upsell.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:02.000
SAM DUTTON: Who is going
to take this next one?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.072
Bunch of questions.

00:23:03.072 --> 00:23:06.010
PAUL IRISH: This is good.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:13.750
Mosen from LA, he has asked some
stuff about Web Forms.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:20.120
First, input type color added to
HTML5 spec a long time ago.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:27.060
It's been implemented in
Chrome and WebKit?

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.130
I know about Chrome.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.060
I'm not sure about Safari
and other ports.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.050
But it, right now, brings up
the operating systems color

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.260
picker widget.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.560
Mosen is asking, why does
it do this versus

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.331
your own color picker?

00:23:43.331 --> 00:23:45.030
PAUL KINLAN: When he says, your
own color picker, does he

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:49.960
mean one that you'd write
yourself or like a

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.860
standardized Chrome one?

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.592
ADDY OSMANI: I guess he means a
general one, something that

00:23:53.592 --> 00:23:56.640
might write tehmselves.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.620
PAUL IRISH: I don't know.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.800
I don't have a great answer.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:03.490
My guess is that it's probably
better for all browsers to use

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.600
the native operating systems
picker than all browsers have

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.110
inconsistent color pickers with
different functionality.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.900
When you leave it up the OS you
present something that is

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.585
probably more familiar
to the user than what

00:24:15.585 --> 00:24:17.780
one implementer thought.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.903
And so I think that consistency
is pleasant.

00:24:19.903 --> 00:24:23.150
Plus it probably is nicer to get
that feature out quicker,

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.025
because you can leverage
something instead of rolling

00:24:26.025 --> 00:24:28.460
it all from scratch.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:33.930
Mosen also asked about input
type week and type time.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.460
Those are not supported well.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.660
Type date is.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.680
And why that is, I think they're
just a matter of

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.390
priorities.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.660
Everyone needs a
date in there.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.157
ADDY OSMANI: It's a
matter of time.

00:24:45.157 --> 00:24:46.654
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it's
a matter of time.

00:24:46.654 --> 00:24:47.652
PAUL IRISH: I like it.

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.650
PAUL LEWIS: Sounds good.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:49.648
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it
was good, wasn't it?

00:24:49.648 --> 00:24:53.660
PAUL IRISH: Everyone needs date
pickers, and so laying

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.910
that first certainly
made sense.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.860
There are tickets.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:06.620
I think I have a link, on the
Web Kit Bug Tracker, ticket

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:08.900
number 86990.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.135
Actually, if I can show you.

00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:15.000
Can we bring up my screen?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.250
Great.

00:25:31.225 --> 00:25:31.490
Cool.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:33.690
It's coming up in
just a moment.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.300
So right now, this ticket--

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:52.810
And of my favorite features is
to view the dependency tree.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.510
So for any ticket you can
understand what are the things

00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:59.940
that have to happen before this
ticket can get closed and

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.030
patch plan this?

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.460
What is this blocking?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.260
And dependency trees, on the
Web Kit Tracker are pretty

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.400
nice to understand how the
whole thing will be

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.650
implemented and the progress
of something.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:19.490
So, in this case, we can do
that, see what's already been

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.825
resolved in this tree.

00:26:20.825 --> 00:26:28.240
And you can see that quite a few
things, a good 90% of what

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.460
is needed for this feature
is complete.

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.820
So take a look at that.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.270
ADDY OSMANI: The next question
is about Yeoman.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.110
Louie Lopez from Spain writes,
what kind of support shall we

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.400
expect for AngularJS?

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.630
Good question.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.260
So with V1 of Yeoman, we are
going to be including a really

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.540
nice scaffold for AngularJS,
which will hopefully let you

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.520
do a little bit of what an
existing project called

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.040
Angular-Seed lets you do.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.770
Which is sort of scaffold out
a brand new Angular project

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.180
and maybe one or two
other things.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.780
We're actually actively working
with the Angular team

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.190
to try getting a little boiler
plate that has best practices

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.000
into there.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.920
And so our support for it out
of the box is going to be

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:13.400
pretty decent.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.470
For anybody that sort of is
more concerned with other

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:19.970
frameworks, like perhaps
Backbone or Ember, we're going

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.740
to, hopefully, in the future,
work with the people involved

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.400
in those projects to create
similar scaffolds.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.120
But we've been working with
proof of concepts that already

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.340
work with Backbone and Ember.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.740
So far, they work great.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.350
And I think it's just going to
be the case of, once Yeoman is

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.450
out, you'll start to see more
of these generators and

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.742
scaffolds come out soon
after, hopefully.

00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:42.490
PAUL LEWIS: And if somebody is
not familiar with what Yeoman

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.800
is, as a tool, could you give
us like the elevator pitch?

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.630
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah, of course.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.970
So Yeoman is an opinionated
workflow for developers that

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.710
will, hopefully, help them
build more beautiful

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:52.940
applications.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.220
We try to take a look
at aspects of

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.710
their development process.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.350
Everybody needs a build process
of some sort, using a

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.760
build tool.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.320
People like the idea of not
having to manually write out a

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.620
lot of the boiler-plate coding
needed for projects.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.430
So Yeoman is also to going
to take care of that.

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.750
We've got a bunch of other
neat stuff in there.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.650
We've got support for headless
WebKit testing.

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.600
We've got a watch process.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.870
You're able to write, for
example, Coffee Script or

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.090
Compass and have that
automatically compile using

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:25.640
[? iReload ?]

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.830
and a bunch of other things.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.040
So you won't even have to go
back and manually compile

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.020
things yourself.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.620
But we've got some other
features in there too.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.496
PAUL KINLAN: Does it support
Web Intents?

00:28:34.496 --> 00:28:35.390
SAM DUTTON: Yes.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:36.180
ADDY OSMANI: Yes.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.950
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:39.740
ADDY OSMANI: That was
the first feature,

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.056
before anything else.

00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:44.032
SAM DUTTON: Shameless.

00:28:44.032 --> 00:28:45.411
PAUL KINLAN: It doesn't
matter.

00:28:45.411 --> 00:28:46.824
You're not going to actually
launch with it.

00:28:46.824 --> 00:28:48.237
ADDY OSMANI: Oh, god no.

00:28:48.237 --> 00:28:50.600
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.160
I'll work on it.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.070
I'll get it in.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.489
It'll be good.

00:28:53.489 --> 00:28:54.671
ADDY OSMANI: That's
your evenings

00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:55.921
cleared up right there.

00:28:59.165 --> 00:29:05.920
PAUL IRISH: The next question
comes from JahRomero.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.830
And it's asking, are there any
plans to allow side-by-side

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.306
installs of different Chrome
channels on Linux?

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.820
So Chrome Canary is available
on Windows and Mac.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.556
And Chrome Canary, I think, is
fantastic for developers.

00:29:27.556 --> 00:29:30.390
I know, I run Chrome Stable
and then Chrome Linux

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.130
side-by-side all the time.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:33.625
You guys, is that
how you roll?

00:29:33.625 --> 00:29:36.140
PAUL KINLAN: Well, I tend to get
the latest Chromium build

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:37.390
every night from Linux.

00:29:40.502 --> 00:29:43.380
PAUL IRISH: So Chrome Canary
works great for Mac and

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.324
Windows, but there's a lot
of people on Linux.

00:29:46.324 --> 00:29:49.180
And I understand that not having
Canary is a bummer.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.430
There are builds, depending
on what flavor you're on.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:30:01.240
I know there is a package that's
maintained for Ubuntu,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.670
for a nightly Chromium build.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:09.350
And so take a look around
for maintained

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:12.270
unstable Chromium packages.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.200
That updates every night.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.960
Otherwise, there's plenty of
scripts that people have

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.865
written, just batch scripts that
go and fetch it on the

00:30:19.865 --> 00:30:21.720
fly for you.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.750
Is yours just like you have
it set on chron job?

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:26.215
PAUL KINLAN: I've just got a
bookmark to the directory

00:30:26.215 --> 00:30:28.680
where they are, and I download
it when it's up.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.663
But I've seen some scripts,
like shell scripts, which

00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:31.405
just, basically, pull it in.

00:30:31.405 --> 00:30:32.800
And it will work quite nice.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.076
PAUL IRISH: If you do want an
absolute edge Chromium build,

00:30:35.076 --> 00:30:40.390
you can go to
downloadchromium.appspot.com,

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.760
which just sniffs out what OS
you're on and gives you one

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.490
single click.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.190
Because finding that actual
directory is kind of a pain.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:49.110
PAUL KINLAN: Yes.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.922
And it changed a while
ago, right?

00:30:50.922 --> 00:30:52.215
PAUL IRISH: Yep.

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:55.370
ADDY OSMANI: So Hussein from
Colorado writes, what parts of

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.107
the Chrome ecosystem is the
team most excited about--

00:30:58.107 --> 00:30:59.061
PAUL KINLAN: Web Intents.

00:30:59.061 --> 00:30:59.790
ADDY OSMANI: No.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.980
I haven't finished
the sentence, and

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.700
he's already on it.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.640
It doesn't have to be one thing,
Yeoman, AngularJS,

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.150
HTML5 features.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.870
I think it will useful
to go around.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.670
I can't imagine what you'd
most interested in.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.640
PAUL KINLAN: So I'm actually
interested in helping

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.710
developers just build great
web apps quickly and have

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.180
great web apps to talk
to each other.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.800
I mean, that's the problem I've
always face on the web is

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.530
that you don't have to do really
deep integrations and

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.272
just building all these
things is really hard.

00:31:25.272 --> 00:31:27.310
So anything that makes my life
easier, to build great web

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:28.295
apps, is good.

00:31:28.295 --> 00:31:32.360
So things like Yeoman,
I'm excited about.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.400
I've used Backbone quite
a bit recently.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:36.120
I've not really tried Angular,
but I've heard a lot of good

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.310
things, those type of things.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.072
Anything that makes
it easy for me.

00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:43.250
PAUL LEWIS: Me, I'm
kind of excited--

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.190
I guess I'm similar on this, but
WebRTC, for me, is one of

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.590
the things.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.376
Because it's quite disruptive
thing to see coming through.

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:51.096
PAUL IRISH: That's
a good answer.

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:54.180
PAUL LEWIS: I'm a big fan of
disruptive stuff, just because

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.330
I'm a big believer in what
the browser can do.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.110
And so seeing this stuff
landing in the browser,

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.800
without plug-ins, it's
opened so many doors.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.120
So, for me, it's WebRTC
for sure.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.120
PAUL KINLAN: So just on that
point, we've been able to do

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.390
things which we've never
been able to do.

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.100
And I'm sorry for jumping in.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.620
PAUL LEWIS: That's
good though.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.400
I know where you're going.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.672
PAUL KINLAN: Where am I going?

00:32:11.672 --> 00:32:13.058
PAUL LEWIS: I think you'll
go with packaged app.

00:32:13.058 --> 00:32:14.100
PAUL KINLAN: I am going
with packaged apps.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.090
We hadn't even planned this.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.072
It's so good.

00:32:16.072 --> 00:32:19.270
We just connected.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.450
The latest version of Chrome
Packaged Applications, for

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:26.150
instance, allows access to
network sockets, UDP, TCP.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.575
You have Bluetooth, USB, all
these type of things, which

00:32:28.575 --> 00:32:30.600
we've never had in the
browser before.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.183
So yeah, that's another
one I'm very

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.490
excited about as well.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.430
And I won't interrupt again.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:36.850
ADDY OSMANI: Is that
a promise?

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.950
I believe you.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.110
I'm most interested in anything
that helps developers

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.870
build applications more easily
and that factors into Yeoman.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.950
I'm also really interested
in Web Components.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:54.650
I see that being the future of
how people, perhaps, create

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.260
widgets and applications.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.830
And perhaps there'll be less
of an emphasis on the

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.320
frameworks they use and more
about what the browser can

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.810
give you right out of the box.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.390
So I think it's going to be
really exciting to see what

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.460
happens there.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.180
Paul?

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.410
PAUL LEWIS: He's busy going left
while we're going right.

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.870
ADDY OSMANI: Just
say, everything.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:12.900
PAUL IRISH: I know, right?

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.830
What are you going to go with?

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.155
SAM DUTTON: I'm not
going to tell you.

00:33:16.155 --> 00:33:17.710
PAUL KINLAN: Well,
I'll tell you.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.811
He was going to say,
Web Intents.

00:33:19.811 --> 00:33:22.150
SAM DUTTON: I was going
to way Web Intents.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.196
PAUL IRISH: I really like
all the things there.

00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:25.696
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, me too.

00:33:25.696 --> 00:33:30.010
PAUL IRISH: One of the things
about WebRTC though is that--

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.500
a small thing, just
a small one--

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.390
it's still behind.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.440
You have to go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.120
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.180
PAUL IRISH: It's still
in Canary?

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.040
SAM DUTTON: Beta.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.750
It's in stable, but it's
behind the flags.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:43.580
PAUL IRISH: It's in stable?

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.170
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.470
But it's behind flags.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.150
PAUL IRISH: But in Canary
is it behind flags?

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:47.655
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:48.590
In Canary--

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:50.306
oh god, I'm going to
get this wrong.

00:33:50.306 --> 00:33:51.360
PAUL KINLAN: I thought beta was
still behind the flags.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.230
ADDY OSMANI: I thought
beta was [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.020
SAM DUTTON: It's complicated.

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.325
Sorry.

00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:56.620
Just--

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.340
a little explanation.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.640
There were originally two flags
you needed to enable to

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.020
use WebRTC.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.920
One was MediaStream.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.560
One was PeerConnection.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:11.639
What's happened is that it's
basically working that, as the

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.850
versions of Chrome come through,
you don't need to

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.383
enable MediaStream.

00:34:15.383 --> 00:34:17.400
But PeerConnection, for the
actual peer-to-peer

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.760
communication stuff, still
needs to be enabled.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.215
So what that means is that get
user media is available.

00:34:24.215 --> 00:34:28.389
We will be coming with flagless
implementation, but,

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:31.139
for a while, PeerConnection
is behind a flag.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:32.609
PAUL IRISH: And just
to clarify--

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:35.300
SAM DUTTON: Don't ask me to
remember which specific

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.650
versions it's in.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:37.170
PAUL IRISH: Oh, it's fine.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:43.590
Just to clarify, get user media
is the evolution of the

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.150
device tag from forever ago.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:46.889
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, kind of.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.830
PAUL IRISH: So it's usually
just part of WebRTC.

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:52.920
But you don't need to be doing
in realtime communication with

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.820
anyone else.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.699
You can just be using get user
media as a way to get access

00:34:56.699 --> 00:34:57.549
to the camera, microphone--

00:34:57.549 --> 00:34:59.105
SAM DUTTON: All that, yeah.

00:34:59.105 --> 00:35:01.600
PAUL IRISH: But WebRTC with

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:03.920
PeerConnection is hugely powerful.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.180
And even though it is available
pretty widely now,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.760
behind a flag, I don't think
we've really seen a great

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.610
killer app with it.

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:16.560
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, come on.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.860
PAUL IRISH: The fact that I
connect to a peer, not send

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.160
all my bandwidth through a
server, so you can create,

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.250
essentially, a video chat app
that can scale beautifully.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.370
Because all the connection
is peer-to-peer.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:36.580
With things like noise
cancellation, duplex sound--

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.960
SAM DUTTON: Echo cancellation
and so on--

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.805
PAUL KINLAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:38.805 --> 00:35:40.740
PAUL IRISH: And variable
bit rate, based on

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.160
your connection speed.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.860
Them amount of technology that's
in there, things that

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.132
you don't have to worry about
is pretty incredible.

00:35:49.132 --> 00:35:52.158
PAUL KINLAN: So one thing that
we would love to see is,

00:35:52.158 --> 00:35:55.720
obviously, because there's the
PeerConnection API, and

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:56.390
[INAUDIBLE] and all
that type of stuff

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.490
you can build a server.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.050
Like a client and the
peer-to-peer thing, which is

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:04.050
actually not a web browser,
it's just a web servelet.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.988
Render a display buffer
to it, send it out.

00:36:05.988 --> 00:36:06.442
I think it would be brilliant.

00:36:06.442 --> 00:36:07.350
SAM DUTTON: That
is interesting.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.692
PAUL KINLAN: You could just do
a whole lot of stuff with

00:36:08.692 --> 00:36:09.580
that, and it would be cool.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.650
SAM DUTTON: One of
the things--

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.426
PAUL KINLAN: We need to
experiment with it, right?

00:36:12.426 --> 00:36:13.180
People need to do that.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:13.785
Let's test it.

00:36:13.785 --> 00:36:15.880
SAM DUTTON: One of the things,
just to reiterate a bit,

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.370
WebRTC, this is all about,
potentially, direct

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:20.390
peer-to-peer connection.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:23.392
But there's a whole stack of
stuff built into WebRTC to

00:36:23.392 --> 00:36:26.890
cope with NATraversal and
communication of streaming

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:31.270
data from behind the
firewalls and to

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.800
make that really seamless.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.260
That's one of the
great strengths.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.150
The other thing we'll be seeing
later in the year, we

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.340
hope or certainly is planned,
is DataChannel API.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.620
At the moment, we've seen
WebRTC apps that

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.140
use the video stuff.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.610
And what's planned is this API
called DataChannel, which does

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:55.684
the same thing, but for any
kind of arbitrary data, so

00:36:55.684 --> 00:36:56.530
incredibly powerful.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:57.830
PAUL KINLAN: Over peer-to-peer
WebSockets?

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:00.680
SAM DUTTON: Yeah, peer-to-peer
data.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.500
PAUL KINLAN: Right--

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.585
SAM DUTTON: Oh, come on.

00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:03.456
PAUL KINLAN: You know when I
said I wouldn't interrupt?

00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:04.580
We've actually had a remote
gate crasher.

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.740
Seth Wright wants us to say
Dart is his most exciting

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:09.470
platform feature.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.540
ADDY OSMANI: That
surprises me.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.770
SAM DUTTON: If you haven't
used Dart, give it a go.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.264
Try it out.

00:37:15.264 --> 00:37:19.436
I got to give one more plug
since it's my turn.

00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:22.140
I've got to mention the track
element, which is really

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.000
interesting.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.380
I think if you haven't had a
look at this, it's a really

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:36.684
simple way to get synchronized
timed metadata in with media ,

00:37:36.684 --> 00:37:40.570
such as video and audio, so
simple use cases, stuff like

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.190
captions, subtitles.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.785
But what makes it, for me,
really interesting, aside from

00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:51.080
the accessibility stuff, is
the ability to use timed

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.750
metadata of any kind.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:58.390
So you can have metadata that
relates to times within media

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:01.100
and do anything with that.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:01.920
PAUL KINLAN: Do you want to tell
them about your example

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.400
that you did?

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.890
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:04.390
Shameless plug--

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:05.020
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, go on.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:05.490
It's good.

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:09.970
SAM DUTTON: Have a look
on HTML5 Rocks.

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:12.790
There's an article about
the track elements.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:16.570
We did one in particular based
on some work some guys did

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.391
here at Google.

00:38:18.391 --> 00:38:23.090
If you go to
samdutton.com/maptrack, you'll

00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:28.750
see a demo there, which, like a
guy ride around on a cycle,

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.960
around the Mt View
Google campus.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.170
And you can see that
synchronized with a pointer on

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.060
a map, and also like StreetView

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:37.950
of where he's going.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.950
And that's all done using
the track element.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.370
PAUL KINLAN: You'll see all
that, the geolocation, there's

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.120
the timed elements--

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.000
SAM DUTTON: It's
fairly simple.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.370
It just had a geo file--

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.010
I used an XML file--

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.380
to create, in JavaScript,
the track data.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.780
And yeah, that's it.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.150
You'll need to have
Canary for that.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.600
There's, again, a whole stack
stuff we're going to see.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.150
Bring it on.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.670
Good implementations.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.990
ADDY OSMANI: I guess, since
we're talking about video and

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:04.630
WebRTC, this is an interesting
question for

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.820
Sam from Adam Bradley.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.030
Do you see solutions like
PhoneGap still being useful if

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.270
we're able to capture audio and
video now from new HTML5

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.665
input fields and features?

00:39:16.665 --> 00:39:17.595
SAM DUTTON: Yeah.

00:39:17.595 --> 00:39:19.840
In the short term, certainly.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.340
I mean, I don't see
these things as

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.490
excluding each other.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:27.770
But I can see that the
functionality we get with

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:31.400
MediaStream, if you're using get
user media, that's the API

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.350
behind that MediaStream.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.830
There's a lot of potential to
that stuff which is built

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:37.550
right into the browser.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:39.290
And we'll see wider
implementations across

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:39.740
platforms--

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.500
PAUL KINLAN: I think it
depends right now.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.930
It's like, if you're building
something that's specific for

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.390
Android and want specific
Android integrations, then

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.110
we're not quite there
just yet.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.870
But look at the pace of change
we've had recently, just to

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:54.210
get where we're going.

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.000
It's pretty cool.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.290
PAUL IRISH: The published
goal of PhoneGap is

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.160
to make itself obsolete.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.282
So they want that.

00:40:05.282 --> 00:40:08.600
So hopefully that happens.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.392
SAM DUTTON: Right, where are
we with the questions?

00:40:12.392 --> 00:40:14.360
PAUL KINLAN: We're on
[INAUDIBLE] updates.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.450
PAUL IRISH: We got a
lot of questions.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:24.400
So the next one is GreyGhost
Visuals asks why Chrome does

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.827
not support the rem unit inside
media queries and links

00:40:28.827 --> 00:40:31.000
to a little demo where
that doesn't work.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.890
PAUL KINLAN: So I'm naive.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.093
I don't know what
the rem unit is.

00:40:35.093 --> 00:40:36.625
Is it relative em's?

00:40:36.625 --> 00:40:37.490
PAUL IRISH: Relative em's.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.150
PAUL KINLAN: Is that
what it is?

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:42.927
PAUL IRISH: Jonathan Snook
has a really good

00:40:42.927 --> 00:40:45.030
article about it.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.410
It was a more recent one.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.802
I'm not sure why.

00:40:47.802 --> 00:40:49.745
PAUL KINLAN: Why would you
need it in a media query?

00:40:49.745 --> 00:40:51.470
Is that in the actual filter--

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:54.000
PAUL IRISH: You're defining
a width that you want to

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.520
manipulate, that things are
going to change in.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.090
So I think, actually,
for the media query

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:02.698
condition, not the payload.

00:41:02.698 --> 00:41:05.420
PAUL KINLAN: But then, my only
question is, you normally put

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.550
media query stuff at the top of
the page, where you don't

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.550
even need a relative em.

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.090
You just need a normal em unit,
because that's where

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.818
it's based from, is it not?

00:41:15.818 --> 00:41:23.005
PAUL IRISH: What I would suggest
on this is filing a

00:41:23.005 --> 00:41:28.140
ticket and link it
to your demo.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:30.440
So this is actually the first
time that I've heard that this

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.030
is an issue.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:38.850
So it may not be on the mind of
anyone that could work on

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.100
it and fix it.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.060
So file a ticket and just ping
me afterwards, and I'll try

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.888
and find an engineer who
can take a look.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.864
We got three more minutes.

00:41:53.864 --> 00:41:55.130
PAUL KINLAN: Can I answer one?

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.680
I promised I'd answer some
Web Intents questions.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.400
PAUL IRISH: Yeah, you did.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.217
PAUL KINLAN: Cheers, dudes.

00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:00.670
So it says, I'm currently
implementing a proof of

00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:02.020
concept with Web Intents.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.104
And I'm wondering is it
correct that I have to

00:42:04.104 --> 00:42:05.490
implement a Chrome extension
to support an

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:08.240
intent at the moment?

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.120
Yeah, it's pretty correct
at the moment.

00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.555
We don't have the full
tag support in any of

00:42:13.555 --> 00:42:14.240
the browsers anyway.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.530
We have a JavaScript shim
which emulates.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:21.440
But that's incompatible with
pure Chrome implementation.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.530
So right now, you have to either
have a Chrome extension

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.780
or a packaged app, where you
will define the actions and

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.820
the data type that you want to
work on and what URLs they

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.980
will launch inside the
manifest itself.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:38.110
So, yes, right now, our ultimate
goal is to have the

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.553
manifest as an option, but have
something on the open

00:42:40.553 --> 00:42:44.475
web, which will let you register
functionality with

00:42:44.475 --> 00:42:46.350
the browser of your
application.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.090
So we're not way off.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:50.980
I mean, if you want to build
stuff, here today, Chrome,

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.350
Chrome extensions, Chrome apps,
they're pretty good.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.500
They can be packaged apps or
hosted apps as well, so it

00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.510
doesn't have to be packaged,
which most people think it is.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.550
PAUL LEWIS: And is it worth
mentioning what Web Intents is

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.865
for the uninitiated?

00:43:05.865 --> 00:43:08.410
PAUL KINLAN: There is no
one who is uninitiated.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.820
I keep talking about
it all the time.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.570
PAUL LEWIS: Really?

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:11.820
Hadn't noticed.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.280
PAUL KINLAN: So Web Intents,
they're basically a way for

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.160
you to connect applications,
essentially.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.200
It's an easy way to connect
web applications.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.310
The idea, basically, is that
you'll have two applications,

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.700
which don't need to know about
each other to be able to talk.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.110
So you might share a link from
a web page, and you, as the

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.415
user, get to choose your
preferred service for link

00:43:33.415 --> 00:43:35.640
sharing, not the ones
that are deeply

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.890
integrated into the website.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.308
It's like a discovery mechanism
for applications.

00:43:41.308 --> 00:43:43.670
That's the highest
way of saying it.

00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:45.675
And the pitch I normally do
is if you're familiar with

00:43:45.675 --> 00:43:49.154
Android Intents, it's Android
Intents but for the web.

00:43:49.154 --> 00:43:50.130
So that's the easiest way.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.930
And then another Web Intents
question, someone's given me a

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.400
compliment that says--

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.255
ADDY OSMANI: That's
not a question.

00:43:57.255 --> 00:43:58.510
PAUL KINLAN: It says, where
can I get the awesome--

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.880
I didn't get a compliment?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.320
Fred, from London, where can I
get an awesome laptop skin?

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.310
I thought he said,
I was awesome.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.750
Fred, from London, I can
probably send you one.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.020
We'll meet up or something.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:10.670
PAUL IRISH: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.005
PAUL KINLAN: He's in London,
so it's probably cool.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:15.260
We'll sort something out.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.100
I think we got some
gel skins here.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.056
If not, our producer will
send us something.

00:44:18.056 --> 00:44:18.590
PAUL IRISH: We've got a few.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:26.710
And then we can actually post
the artwork file and you can

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:28.700
go order a custom one
from gelaskins.com.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.241
Let's do that.

00:44:34.241 --> 00:44:35.807
PAUL KINLAN: There is, actually,
one question right

00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:36.640
at the bottom.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.530
It's nothing to do with
what I've been

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:39.550
talking about at all.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.040
When will voice input, within
the Chrome extension pop-up,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.170
be working again?

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.340
There's actually a Chrome
extension API, which allows

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.960
you to not even require
a pop-up.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:50.051
I believe it's experimental
still, so you can play with

00:44:50.051 --> 00:44:51.246
that as well.

00:44:51.246 --> 00:44:54.620
If it's not working, you might
want to look at that one.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.870
PAUL IRISH: One last question.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.230
ADDY OSMANI: So Pete from the UK
writes, can you give us any

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.795
specifics of the Yeoman plug-in
pattern and what the

00:45:00.795 --> 00:45:01.980
library will provide?

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:04.460
How far down the add-task for
everything style are you

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.900
going, or at what point will the
developer be expected to

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.720
manage files and line endings
on their own?

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.315
So Yeoman is going to try as
much as possible to stay an

00:45:13.315 --> 00:45:14.120
opinionated project.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.430
We're going to provide tasks
for things that we think

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:17.230
people will use.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:21.340
So we've got tasks to help with
things like required JS

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.130
and CoffeScript and Compass.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.780
You don't, of course, have
to use those things.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.280
But they're there in case
you do want to use them.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.410
In terms of the plug-in pattern
that we use, it's

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.020
actually really, really
flexible.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.310
You can include, in your
boilerplate or scaffold or

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.950
template or whatever you want to
call it, as many different

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:39.780
policies you want.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.330
So if you're a framework, for
example, you can define the

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.260
models, the views, the
controllers, all the different

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.210
bits and pieces that
are required to

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.700
scaffold something out.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:51.665
And it can be completely
up to your style.

00:45:51.665 --> 00:45:54.280
It can be customized as
much as you want.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.105
And we're going to be providing
a really solid set

00:45:56.105 --> 00:45:59.610
of docs, right now, so at least
that you can go create

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.410
your own templates as
much as you want.

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.110
PAUL IRISH: Cool.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.880
And the last part of that, you
were asking about should

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.093
developers manage files
and line endings?

00:46:08.093 --> 00:46:09.895
As far as line endings
are concerned--

00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:14.490
in the projects we generate?

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:15.660
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:16.890
PAUL IRISH: Editor Config.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.980
Go to editorconfig.org.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.360
It's kind of an emerging
standard that the jQuery

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.770
Project Modernizr, Agent
[INAUDIBLE], a lot of projects

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:26.850
are getting.

00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:30.240
It just sets up a very few
number of rules as far as

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.360
white space preferences, like
carriage return, line feed,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.840
style things, and has plug-ins
for editors so that the

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.070
editors keep all these files
consistent across these

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:43.050
environments.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.190
And this is something that
we think is awesome.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.210
And so we have it as
part of Yeoman.

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.180
I guess that's it for
this Office Hours.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.005
Awesome time with three
Pauls in London.

00:46:54.005 --> 00:46:55.725
ADDY OSMANI: And
the rest of us.

00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:56.340
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.290
Who all--

00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:59.030
PAUL LEWIS: The non-Pauls.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.100
ADDY OSMANI: The non-Pauls.

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.460
PAUL LEWIS: Thank you very
much for joining us.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.330
ADDY OSMANI: Thank you.

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.300
PAUL KINLAN: So are we going
to try and make this a

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.880
relatively regular thing as
well, probably on Thursdays,

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.980
probably about the same time?

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.651
I'm always going to talk
about Web Intents.

00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:15.050
PAUL IRISH: So next time you
see a message go out on

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:17.660
Twitter or G+, click through
the link, ask some more

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:19.580
questions, vote up and down.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.960
And we'd love to answer
everything we can for you.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.160
PAUL KINLAN: And enjoy
the Olympics.

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.380
ADDY OSMANI: Yeah,
the Olympics.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.470
We'll see you guys next time.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:27.070
SAM DUTTON: Thank you.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:27.370
PAUL KINLAN: Bye.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:28.620
SAM DUTTON: See you.
