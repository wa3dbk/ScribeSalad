ETIAN KONIGSBURG:
So hi, everybody.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.270
My name's Etian Konigsburg.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm a frontend
software architect here

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.560
at the "New York Times".

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.890
Today I'm going to
be talking about

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.580
the very real history of our
web performance efforts here

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.027
at the "New York Times".

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:22.860
Before I dive in, I
wanted to share with you

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.550
this tweet by Steve
Souders himself.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.300
If you're not familiar
Steve Souders,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.758
it's the place to
start when you're

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:29.150
talking about web performance.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.240
He tweeted, "Is
performance of 'the Web'

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.860
getting better or worse?

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.710
My past week was
painfully slow, marred

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.600
by top sites w/bad WebPerf.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330
Is it too hard?"

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.850
I don't know if the "New York
Times" was among the sites

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.530
that Steve was
having trouble with.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.350
We've known that we've had a
little bit of a performance

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.100
problem.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.240
I like to think that
he's checking our site

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.250
and he's actually complaining
for real that our site is slow

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.890
so that we make it faster him.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.640
But I'm going to get
back to this question

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000
about whether it's too hard.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.434
So while I was
preparing for this talk,

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:00.350
I was thinking that this
is a very real story.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.325
And it reminded me of a
GEICO ad from about 2006

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:05.200
that I just kind of
wanted to share with you.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.708
So just give me one sec to play.

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.140
[VIDEO PLAYBLACK]

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010
-Paula Sala is a real GEICO
customer, not an actor.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.390
So to help tell her story,
we hired that announcer guy

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910
from the movies.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.480
-When the storm hit, both our
cars were totally under water.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.500
-In a world where both of our
cars were totally under water.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.010
-We thought it would take
forever to get some help.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.026
-But a new wind
was about to blow.

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:33.140
-With GEICO, we had
our check in two days.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.920
-Payback.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.560
This time, it's for real.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.270
-GEICO.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.160
Real service.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.742
Real savings.

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:41.200
ETIAN KONIGSBURG: So I thought
about doing this entire talk

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.230
in movie announcer voice.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.000
I didn't think I'd be able to
keep it up all the way through.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.550
Colt is actually
the expert at that.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.520
So you should check out
his talk on National Talk

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.760
Like A Pirate Day.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.240
That was actually really great.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.830
Kudos.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.460
So in a world of static pages.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.560
Pages on our website
are published basically

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050
like you would a newspaper.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.690
Somebody hits a button, the
content goes through templates

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.310
and is written to disk.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.990
And we mix it with a
proprietary language

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.200
that we compile to give a
little bit of dynamicism

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.450
on the server side.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.600
And it was fast.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.110
We have about 1 million of
these static pages since 2004.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.970
And re-publishing them is
really not an option for us.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.830
If hypothetically it
took about five seconds

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.830
to re-publish one
of these pages,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.250
5 million seconds I think
comes out to about two months.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.540
We can't be doing that
every time we make a change.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.560
So what ends up happening is
it's extremely hard for us

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.080
to change markup once
it's been published.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.170
And every time we
make a change, it's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.730
only present from the
day we deployed onward,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.890
which means we have an
unknown number of permutations

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.040
of these markups to handle
and support over time.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.530
So our frontend assets,
our JavaScript and CSS,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.140
have to handle all of
these permutations.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.800
And in order to be able
to change these files,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.550
since we can't change the
asset path because the HTML is

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.440
static, we have to
keep the time to live,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.010
the cache expiration timeout,
very low on these files, which

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.790
is a performance bad practice.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.160
And we also don't really
know what pages on the site

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.290
call which assets in general.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.570
So I want to talk
about our CSS history.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.530
We didn't really
have a CSS framework,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.960
which means we have a
lot of repetitive styles.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.310
Files were imported
basically as needed.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.155
Style sheets approached.

00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:32.220
The import limits in IE, 31
total and maybe up to three

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.060
nested levels deep.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.597
There was inconsistent
load style.

00:03:35.597 --> 00:03:37.930
We were using link tags in
one case, and right after it,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.460
using a style tag with
an @import directive.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.260
And basically, we also have
to deal with web producers who

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.904
who go through, and they're
able to modify the look

00:03:47.904 --> 00:03:50.070
and feel of our page on the
fly as the news happens.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.130
So they can be dropped
into our content system

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.590
and appear anywhere on the page.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.460
In the JavaScript department,
JavaScript was very ad hoc.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.230
Since most of the dynamicism
was on the server side,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.190
we basically used
JS basically as

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.060
needed to fix
cross-browser issues,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.940
to do widgets that
respond to events

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.950
by the user in the browser.

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.567
Most of the variables
and functions are global.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.650
Script tags are dropped
wherever they were needed.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.530
You would define a new
div, leave it empty,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.280
and you'd put a script
tag right after it.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.470
We didn't defer execution,
another performance no no.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.640
We didn't have a DOM
framework to handle

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.230
any cross-browser functionality.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.210
That framework war happened and
we still hadn't picked one yet.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.390
Some words on images.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.090
Basically, the UI images
that are part of a product

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.860
would get uploaded
individually to production.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.180
You could easily forget
how to do that when

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.090
you were deploying,
so they would

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.750
go missing for a little while.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.260
Our content photography
is extremely hard for us

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.230
to optimize.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.010
We have a lot of pride
in our photography.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.093
There's a lot of resistance
in making them smaller

00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:54.310
and not featuring them
as largely on our pages.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.240
We did some experiments
with lossless compression.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.380
We actually, for
color novices, we

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.142
noticed some colors changing
in whatever these tools were.

00:05:03.142 --> 00:05:05.600
There's a whole department here
that does color correction,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.110
and the red walls don't
appear in their area

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.945
so that they don't have a
little bit of red dilution

00:05:11.945 --> 00:05:15.630
on their screens to do
this color correction.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.980
It's basically a manual
process to resize these images.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.120
We have a lot of them.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.537
And in order for them to be
fast and have them be smaller,

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:25.161
people have to cut them and make
sure they don't crop something

00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:26.150
out of the picture.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.910
Because it's manual, it
doesn't happen a lot.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.940
Other concerns for the business.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.702
We have these
editorial constraints.

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:34.160
Like I mentioned
earlier, producers

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.140
have a need to adjust based on
what's happening in the news.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.160
So we use this
freeform module where

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.560
they can drop any
bit of HTML code.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.000
It doesn't even have
to be balanced tags,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.260
so this can easily
mess up our page.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.840
But they have the
freedom to do that.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.450
And we have to be able to handle
styles and scripts occurring

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.170
in them.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.020
And ads, of course.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.070
They're top-level
objects in our DOM.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.309
They're not treated
in any special way.

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.350
They bring their own copies
of DOM frameworks in.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.850
We get older versions of jQuery.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.241
We saw an ad that tried
to encapsulate prototype

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.490
which, if you're familiar
with how prototype.js works,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.030
it modifies built-in
objects in the browser.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.750
You can't actually
contain it in a box,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.520
so it didn't really work.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.520
Ads animate as
soon as they load.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.510
We get a lot of painting
issues when animations

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.330
happen while the
page is loading.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.340
And basically, they are
higher in the DOM order

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.322
as the page is loading than
our own logo on the homepage.

00:06:31.322 --> 00:06:32.780
You'll see two ads,
and then you'll

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.010
see our logo if you
look at the source.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.790
So just to caveat
all of this history,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.970
it wasn't really
entirely all bad.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.710
We do use a CDN.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.990
We've had Akamai for
a number of years.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.040
It's been great.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:49.195
We did turn GSIP on in 2007.

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:51.260
The bandwidth savings
were actually immediate,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.700
and there were a lot
of really happy people

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.658
as soon as we did that.

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:56.210
But it wasn't on
previously, and it's worth

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.160
mentioning that
we did turn it on.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.040
So a new wind for
our efforts, and what

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.160
we were trying to do starting
in 2009 to make the site faster.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.720
2009 was the year
we were focusing

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.460
on tools and libraries.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.110
We basically built a new build
system for frontend files.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.060
And this was our first foray
into doing automatic builds.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.060
We used to manually
untar uncompressed files

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.270
in production.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.220
And we were actually pulling
changes from version control as

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.310
opposed to somebody's
home directory.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.030
They would arrange the files the
way they wanted them to appear,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.560
we would package them up, and
someone would unpackage it.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.052
Now it's coming from
version control directly.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.510
There were
semi-stateful rollbacks.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.676
There was a rollback
mechanism, but you could really

00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:39.340
only roll back the latest one.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.140
If you tried to roll
back any before that,

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.496
you would end up in an unknown
state, and that was really bad.

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:45.870
But the really
exciting bit of it

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.270
was that there were
hooks for build scripts.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.140
And we can expand on this
process basically dynamically.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.700
So we did just that for our CSS.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.760
It was the first system
to use those new hooks.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.100
And we wrote a bunch
proprietary scripts

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.830
to not only unravel the ad
import directives to make

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.649
one concatenated file,
we wrote a script

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:07.690
to also try and to remove
some of the white space

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.314
and the comments.

00:08:09.314 --> 00:08:11.480
This was all downstream
from development work, which

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.990
is also a really good point.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.200
We didn't want our
developers to feel

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.615
that they couldn't comment
their work adequately.

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:19.990
While we were
doing this, we were

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.440
working on our CSS framework.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.310
We took the concepts
from our design,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.990
and we turned them
into these base files

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.710
that can be used
across the site.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.290
We split code into
reusable modules

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.850
and actually tried to
reuse them in a sane way.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.500
We aim to have a single entry
point at the top of the page.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.000
While we're doing
this, we were also

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.020
trying to lock down
our JS development.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.309
We introduced a
top-level namespace

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.530
called NYTD, and
the module pattern,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.890
also called the immediately
invoked function expression.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:50.510
This is a great way to wrap all
your variables in a closure,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.320
although thanks to Colt,
I'm now afraid of closures.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.030
We introduced prototype.js
as a DOM library.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.094
This one bullet
point doesn't really

00:09:00.094 --> 00:09:02.010
reflect the amount of
meetings and discussions

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.660
and debates and fights we
had over this decision.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.440
But prototype.js
won out in the end.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.860
We also tried to write our
own proprietary asynchronous

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.965
JavaScript loader in the
days before RequireJS.

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:16.320
LABjs, any of these
loaders, they didn't exist.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.210
We tried to write our own.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.180
It didn't really work.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.230
It became a synchronous
JavaScript loader.

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.250
So we started with our
homepage, and there's

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.540
a number of reasons why.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.555
It's published very
frequently, so this problem

00:09:27.555 --> 00:09:30.109
with legacy markup really
doesn't become an issue.

00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:32.150
It gets the most traffic,
so it has the potential

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.670
to save people the
most amount of time.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.000
It has an isolated
implementation.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.100
Basically, if
something went wrong,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.284
nothing would go wrong on
other parts of the site.

00:09:41.284 --> 00:09:42.950
And it's viewed very
heavily internally.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.366
If something were
really bad, it'd

00:09:44.366 --> 00:09:47.940
get noticed before it
got out into production.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.720
So November, 2009, we
put our CSS optimizations

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.880
on the homepage.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.330
It saved 25 HTTP connections to
what are very small CSS files.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
The first paint occurred
a whole second earlier,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.710
and the homepage
really felt faster.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.820
And we are very happy by this.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.940
So in 2010, we wanted to
continue these efforts.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.630
The CSS framework
basically rolled out

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.680
to our section
and article pages.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.820
Again, we were focusing
on a single entry point.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.737
But we never optimized them.

00:10:15.737 --> 00:10:18.070
There were some concerns with
these proprietary scripts.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:19.944
And it turns out later,
when we did an audit,

00:10:19.944 --> 00:10:21.606
that we were right
to be concerned.

00:10:21.606 --> 00:10:23.230
There were references
to missing files.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.880
There were @import cycles.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.640
A would include B
include C include A.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.890
And if you're ever curious
about what the browser does

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.140
to get out of that, I still
don't know the answer.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.649
And there were syntax errors.

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:35.190
There were styles
not getting applied

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.900
because they were
typed improperly.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.740
So we decided to build a
new JS build system in 2010.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.850
We forked the codebase.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.370
We wanted to create
a clean build.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.030
And only code that was
modular and namespaced

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.120
would be able to
be in this build.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.730
Basically, we have these
manifests of files that had

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.830
an @import-like syntax in a JS
comment so that they would be

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.210
inert if the build
process failed.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.449
We used YUI Compressor
for minification.

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:05.240
We no longer want to
write our own scripts.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.940
This was well supported
at the time, so why not?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.090
We were focusing
on two build files,

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.980
one at the top,
one at the bottom.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.772
If you're familiar with
the best practices,

00:11:13.772 --> 00:11:15.271
they say that you're
supposed to put

00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.920
your JS at the
bottom of the page.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.800
So why did we have
them at the top?

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.474
If you remember that editors
can put JavaScript on the page.

00:11:21.474 --> 00:11:23.140
If we wanted them to
use our frameworks,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.216
it had to be there before they
could actually run their code.

00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:27.840
So we put stuff at
the top to make sure

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.590
that that wouldn't
break anything.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.670
This build process
was executed manually,

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.780
so it didn't see
widespread usage.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.130
It's basically almost
only on the homepage.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.460
And now we have two code
bases and still no automatic

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.520
build process.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.964
But when we did launch these
JS changes to the homepage,

00:11:42.964 --> 00:11:43.880
it was pretty drastic.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.405
We got a 50% speedup,
six seconds down from 12.

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:49.530
We were very excited by that.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.409
So 2011 was a bit
of a slow year.

00:11:52.409 --> 00:11:54.950
As you might remember if you're
fans of "The New York Times",

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.150
we introduced digital
subscriptions in 2011.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.830
So resourcing for
this kind of work

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.910
was really, really
hard to come by.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.920
Oh, hello.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.730
I don't know what I just did.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.600
All right.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.250
There were efforts to optimize
our analytics packaging.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.790
We have a lot of
analytics packages,

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.970
and they were kind of doing
some really bad stuff.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.980
They got aborted,
mostly because we

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.727
were afraid to break
these actual reports.

00:12:19.727 --> 00:12:21.560
We wanted to make sure
that the business was

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.770
able to analyze
things correctly,

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.980
so we didn't continue that.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.650
So we used a series of code
reviews and style guides

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.200
to make sure that
we were enforcing

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.660
good standards
and best practices

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.030
to keep the status quo.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.220
But at the end of 2011,
we made the decision.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.040
We decided to
replace prototype.js

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.820
with jQuery sitewide.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.207
And as you can imagine,
this is really, really hard.

00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:46.540
We needed both of them to
coexist during the transition.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.581
We weren't going to rewrite
everything and launch

00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:50.390
a new site on a new
framework all at once,

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.210
so we needed both
of them to basically

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.910
be around while we did this.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.920
But in 2012, a group
of five developers

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.450
basically set out to try
and excise prototype.js

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.280
from article pages.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.511
And we were making really,
really excellent progress.

00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:05.510
Things were going great.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.090
Hours and hours of work.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.040
And then we found out there
were some inline scripts that

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.936
made references to prototype.js.

00:13:12.936 --> 00:13:15.560
And if you remember that we have
these static pages with markup

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.000
that we can't change,
we really have no idea

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.730
of what's calling prototype.js
in inline scripts.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.350
And so therefore, we're not
ever able to remove prototype.js

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.040
fully from our site.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.290
So now we have two frameworks.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.200
They both download.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.020
They're both still in use.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.370
And this actually causes
some really strange bugs

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.200
in older IE, where you
don't have a get elements

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.640
by class name.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.710
Prototype.js would
add one, and jQuery

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.490
will detect it and use it.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.540
It returns prototype
objects and jQuery says,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.330
I have no idea what
these are, and fails.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.200
So 2012 also marked the end
of life for this proprietary

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.740
build system.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.160
We basically
migrated to a system

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.030
that mirrored our entire
SPN repositories via Hudson.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.600
We wrote a new script to
concatenate these CSS imports.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.740
We needed feature parity
with what we had before.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.615
So we had to write
something new to make sure

00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:07.580
that we could handle it for the
homepage, which already had it.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.230
It does have all these
features, although CSSLint

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.500
is added on the list to
catch syntax errors that

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.660
didn't exist until
2012, I believe.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.850
It uses YUI Compressor
to do minification,

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.510
and also has to be run manually.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.180
So again, it's really just
limited to the homepage.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.250
So finally, I'm going to
talk a bit about some efforts

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.030
in modern times of
what we're trying

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.780
to do to really
fix this problem.

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.760
So we were really gifted
a very rare opportunity

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.840
by the business.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.560
In March, 2013, the
"New York Times"

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.400
announced that it was going
to introduce a new article

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.560
redesign.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.650
For us, it's more than
just a new user interface

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.192
and a new user experience.

00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:47.650
It's really a
technological reboot.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.670
We've changed everything
about our systems

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.380
in order to deal with some
of these legacy issues

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.730
that we've had.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.210
So the best thing-- and I have
an exclamation point here.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.110
And it really doesn't represent
our excitement by this.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.911
We have dynamic pages now.

00:15:00.911 --> 00:15:02.910
We no longer have to deal
with an unknown number

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.150
of permutations.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.790
We can actually
change our asset URLs

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.000
on the fly to bypass the cache
as soon as we do a deploy.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.060
We pushed a lot of
the user customization

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.705
into the client side.

00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:14.080
We're not doing
it on the server,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.770
so we can actually cache our
pages better on the backend.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.730
We introduced HTML 5 Boilerplate
and Modernizr to give us

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.610
a nice starting point
for these new pages.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.700
So now we have a modern
build system using Grunt.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.840
It can be run both in
our developer sandboxes

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.840
and in Hudson to
prepare a build.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.644
And most of these
web performance

00:15:31.644 --> 00:15:33.810
best practices are actually
available as Grunt tasks

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.226
already, which
made it really easy

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:40.160
to integrate some of this
great advice for our code.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.440
We're using RPM packaging
for deployments.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.620
They have very great
rollback support,

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.190
and they're really easy to use.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.430
So for style development,
we switched to using LESS.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.250
LESS itself handles
concatenation.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.550
Minification is supported
by YUI Compressor

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:58.970
through the Grunt task.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.372
So this was really easy
to get, these two wins.

00:16:01.372 --> 00:16:03.830
Variables and mixins allow us
to do some really interesting

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.290
things in CSS that we had
to do with images before.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.240
Arrows, buttons, data
URIs, and spriting.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.990
So earlier this year,
I wrote a Grunt task

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.600
that automates the
creation of spritesheets.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.220
I don't really know
what the diction

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.192
is around sprites
and spritesheets.

00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:21.900
And I don't know.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.660
What do you call the individual
images in a spritesheet?

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.630
I have no idea.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.740
So I'm making up
the terminology.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.930
Basically, the task takes in
a bunch of images and exports

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.700
not only the
combined spritesheet,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.360
but also a bunch
of mixins and LESS

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.740
with the background coordinates,
which makes it not only

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.610
really easy to make these
combined images-- you don't

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.276
have to maintain them manually--
it's really easy for developers

00:16:42.276 --> 00:16:43.350
to use them in the code.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.190
The mixins are named
after the image itself,

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.660
so you just put the image
name and you basically

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.480
get the sprite.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.480
And the best part about
it is if the coordinates

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.640
change because we've added a new
image, and if it's alphabetical

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.200
and you added a C, right?

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.222
And all the images shift
a little bit, right?

00:16:58.222 --> 00:16:59.930
All you have to do is
rebuild the system,

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.220
and all the coordinates
are updated.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.886
Nobody has to go in and actually
figure something out and change

00:17:03.886 --> 00:17:04.560
anything.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.339
And we're currently
combining about I

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.319
think over 100 small
images into one.

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:11.900
That's 99 saved requests
to very small files

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.930
that we need for our new design.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:14.930
I'm not showing it here.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.420
You can check out the marketing
page to see what it looks like.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.390
Just a heads up.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.650
For JavaScript, we
switched to RequireJS.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.220
This handles, again,
concatenation and minification

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:27.970
in the Grunt task.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.490
And we also get
source maps, which

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.530
is something we're
really excited to use

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.590
for our development.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.212
We no longer need
a global namespace.

00:17:35.212 --> 00:17:36.920
That's why the slide
is titled that we're

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.950
deleting our
window.nytd namespace.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.310
We get asynchronous
loading of JavaScript.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.620
And we basically decided
to focus on larger

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.376
build files so that
once you've established

00:17:48.376 --> 00:17:50.250
a connection on mobile,
you want to make sure

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.324
you keep the latency low.

00:17:51.324 --> 00:17:53.240
That the initial handshake
can be really high.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.340
So we keep these large
build files around instead

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.930
of using a bunch of
individual RequireJS loads.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.980
Since we moved a lot of
the client customization

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.060
to the browser,
we needed to make

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.860
sure we could template properly.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.450
So we use Underscore
JS Templates

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.470
instead of building with
the DOM or any HTML strings.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.940
And its way faster
to precompile.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.981
You're essentially running
a JavaScript function,

00:18:14.981 --> 00:18:16.750
which is optimized
in the browser.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.435
Grunt can automate this
compilation as a built-in task

00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:20.540
to do it.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.610
And we turn them into
a RequireJS module

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.270
that gets included as
part of our build process.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.420
So we use Backbone to organize
everything into modules.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.890
They are reusable and they
are shared across applications

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.469
if we would like them to be.

00:18:33.469 --> 00:18:35.010
But the real win is
that they give us

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.990
a bunch of inherited
functionality.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.120
So we can abstract out
touch events and analytics

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:44.329
or some common element
references so that we can--

00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:46.120
we won't have to look
them up all the time,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.520
and we can get this
functionality and everything

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.280
very easily.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.270
We get event delegation,
fewer event listeners,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.340
so things run a
little more smoothly.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.820
And the modules communicate
with each other using events,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.160
so you can publish
events or you can

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.670
subscribe to another
module's events

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.499
to find out about changes.

00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:03.540
So this is the big topic.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.610
What do we do about ads?

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.510
We took ads out of
the critical path.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:10.040
What we do is on DOM ready,
we write the ad markup

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.470
into a new IFrame.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.000
You just take the
frame's document,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.660
and you document.write
it into the frame.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.270
And what happens if the ad
itself calls document.write,

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.650
you don't lose your whole page.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.170
You would just lose the
content of the IFrame, which

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.620
is blank to begin with.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.076
So we don't care what they
do once they're in the frame,

00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:25.700
once they load.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.314
If they decide to bust out
of the frame, they can.

00:19:28.314 --> 00:19:30.730
But we have this notion of
trusted ads that aren't framed.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.020
And trusted basically means
that they specifically

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.320
don't do things that
are bad for page speed.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.040
And also if there's actually a
problem, it's very easy for us

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.000
to get in touch with
them and make the change.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.530
And this has been really,
really effective for us.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.416
So this is the results page.

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:48.040
I thought it would
be great to show you

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.110
a comparative slide
of our waterfalls

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.270
to show you how really
dramatic this is.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.110
We're not quite ready to show
you that information yet.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.200
It's still being built, so we're
not quite ready to do that.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.510
But to give you an overview.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.135
Before starting to
render the page,

00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:04.890
it used to download
over 60 requests.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.390
It's about 10 now,
maybe even fewer.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.270
Before we're fully loaded, we
had to download 200 assets.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.070
It's about 70 now.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.850
Start render is under
one second in Chrome,

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:18.360
and document complete is
under three seconds in Chrome.

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.700
So this is a huge win for us.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.310
Before, previously,
document complete

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.540
would be about nine seconds
on our article pages.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.200
So to answer Steve's
question about

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:31.060
is web performance
too hard, no and yes.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.010
It's really not that hard.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.920
The optimization
practices are really not

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.180
that difficult to begin with.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.940
And there's excellent tooling
that exists to make it really,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.560
really, really easy to do.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.840
However, there are
some unique challenges

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.730
that I think not
just big websites,

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.840
but companies tend to have
their own challenges that people

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.710
can't solve their
problems for them.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.500
And not to mention any legacy
decisions such as ours, where

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.940
we have our static pages
that was holding us back.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.190
We found that we did this
negative feedback cycle.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.189
We had this bad,
this poor setup.

00:20:59.189 --> 00:21:01.480
And we tried to this proprietary
fix to make it better.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.063
And we found ourselves slightly
worse off than we were before,

00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:06.840
even though we were getting
slightly faster speed.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.320
So here's some stuff that we
learned, share some advice.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.920
It's really worth
it to fight to solve

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.560
these big, difficult problems.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.777
They are the 800 pound gorilla
in the room for a reason.

00:21:16.777 --> 00:21:17.610
Fight to solve them.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.234
Once they're out of
your way, it really

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:22.014
opens the path to making
this a lot simpler.

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:23.430
We live in a world
where you don't

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.070
have to rely on proprietary
systems anymore.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:28.810
You might need some
because it's your business,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.350
so you may need to
make sure that you

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.520
have all your requirements
taken care of.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.190
But a lot of the tooling is
just to make this very simple.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:41.310
I always say that you
should HTTP connections

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.900
before you count
bytes in every file.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.270
Do the big easy wins first.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.380
It's really easy to
combine files together

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.460
than it is to figure
out what code is old

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.880
and needs to be removed
from your files.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.070
And automate everything.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.070
As soon as you introduce
manual to the equation,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.370
it really doesn't get done.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.110
So if you can
automate everything,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:05.160
it's by far going to pave the
road and make it really easy.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.010
So that's it.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.889
I think I'm running out of time.

00:22:07.889 --> 00:22:08.680
Thank you very much

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.667
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:14.750
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.490
ETIAN KONIGSBURG: I don't think
I have time for questions.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.570
But I will be around at dinner,
so if you want to come find me.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.250
And I can talk endlessly
about this, so please find me.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.130
I will share all
of my knowledge.
