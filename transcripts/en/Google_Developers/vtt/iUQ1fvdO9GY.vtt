ADDY OSMANI: Hi there.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.960
My name is Addy Osmani.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.930
I'm an engineer on
the Yeoman team.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.920
And today we're going to walk
through creating a new web

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.340
application using Yeoman, a
workflow comprised of tools

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.430
for improving your productivity
and speed during

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.940
development.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.820
Yeoman is comprised of
three main tools--

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.450
Yo for application, Bower for
front-end package management,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.090
and Grunt for building
your projects.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.900
Let's dive right in to
creating a new to do

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.900
application from scratch.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.630
To get Yeoman installed,
you'll need to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.430
use Node and NPM.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.950
Make sure you have recent
versions of both available so

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.680
that everything works
correctly.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.230
So we're just going to run NPM
install g, yo, and allow it to

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.480
go install its dependencies.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.620
And we're now going to install
an AngularJS Yeoman generator

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.710
for scaffolding out
a new Angular app.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.890
Now, you only need to do this
once, so NPM install g

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.140
generator angular.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.360
Fantastic.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.040
Now, we can go run yo angular
to begin scaffolding a new

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.400
application.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.890
This will ask us a number of
questions, such as do you want

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.210
to include Twitter Bootstrap?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.080
I'm going to say yes.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.420
It gives us options about
whether we want to use Compass

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.640
and a few other angular
resources.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.190
What this process is now doing
is fetching any dependencies

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.200
needed for our AngularJS
workflow and scaffolding out

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.520
any files required
for application.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.030
Next, I'm going to preview
what this looks like.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.280
So I'm going to use
Grunt server.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.280
And this is now firing up a
local server for me to preview

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.430
me application.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.540
And there we go.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.230
Because this project is using
Live Reload, I can actually

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.040
make changes to my sources, and
without me having to do

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.760
anything else, it'll refresh
my browser for me, so I get

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.570
this real time view of what's
going on inside my app.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.780
Now, I'm going to go to my
angular controller that was

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.050
scaffolded out.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.360
And what I'm doing right
now is I'm creating a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.910
new array of todos--

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.090
so item one, item two,
and item three.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.840
And these are some simple
todo items that'll be

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.840
reflected in my app.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.789
I'm now going to go
back to main.html.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.370
And we're going to define a
template for these todos.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.990
My todos is going to be the
title of this page.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.050
And I'm going to start
defining my

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.200
template, so new paragraph.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.810
And I'm going to use NG repeat,
which is an angular

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.670
directive for allowing me to
basically repeat something for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.100
different items in
a collection.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.450
So I've got repeat, todo, and
todo, so for each todo in my

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.560
todos array.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.490
And I'm now going to just
declare a new input field.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.700
And I'm using NG model which
represents a new angular model

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820
with two way binding.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.583
As you can see, it's now
reflecting the todos array

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.060
that we defined earlier
inside my page.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.790
Let's now add the ability to
create some new todo items.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.010
And I'm going to define
a new form for this.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.900
So let's go down.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.000
Let's create a brand new form.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.060
And I don't need the
action on it.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.370
But what I am going to do is
that NG submit, which is

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.790
another angular interactive.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.800
And I'm going to say, call
add todo whenever

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.065
this form is submitted.

00:03:07.065 --> 00:03:09.710
What we're now going to do
is just add some divs for

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.670
styling, some div wrappers
for styling, add

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.790
some classes on that.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.720
And next, I'm going to add an
input field referencing our

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.120
todo model.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.990
So there we go.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.030
And NG model equals todo.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.150
Let's give it some constraints
for the number of characters.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.980
And we should also probably add
a button just to say add

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.550
or something like that, so that
when you've typed in some

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.600
text into your input field, we
can just click on Add to add a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.980
new todo item.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.270
And there we go.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.440
Awesome.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.385
Let's now head back
to main.js.

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:47.320
As you can see, there's a
preview of our application

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.545
displaying the new field
and the new button.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:51.810
We're going to head
back to main.js.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.520
And here we're going
to add in that todo

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.930
function to our scope.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.070
So there we go-- add
todo function.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.440
And this is basically going to
push new todo items to the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.750
todo array every single time
that you create a new todo

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.690
item from the UI.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.220
There we go--

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.440
perfect.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750
So let's quickly
test this out.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.200
So let's say buy some
more milk and add--

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.660
there we go.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.420
It's working.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.870
Learn AngularJS suite--

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.240
awesome.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.080
So that all works great.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.280
Next, let's look at the ability
to remove todo items.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.460
So I'm going to go and head
back to my main.html file.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.120
And we're going to add a button
to our template, which

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.570
is basically an x.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.130
And that's going to appear
next to each to do item,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.760
allowing you to remove it.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
So here we've added another
directive, NG click.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.130
And it's basically referencing
remove todo,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.750
passing through a reference.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.030
And, as you can see, the x now
appears next to each item.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.375
And we're going to head back
to main.js and define our

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.240
remove todo function
within our scope.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.550
So scope.removetodo
equals function.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.210
And we're going to use the
splice function which lets us

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.930
remove old elements from an
array using an index.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.920
And there we.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.280
Index one--

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.180
perfect.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.430
So let's try this out.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.250
Buy some more milk.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.690
We've added it and removed it.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.340
And as you can see, this
all works great.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.420
So how about next we make
our todo items sortable?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.160
So let's refresh the page.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.510
We're going to use the Bower
package manager for this.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.090
So what we want to do is use
AngularUI, which is a

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.280
companion to the AngularJS
project for UI components.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.750
So first I'm going to list what
packages I have locally

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.110
installed using Bower Lists.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.550
And as you can see, we
have a few of them

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.200
pre-installed for us.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.620
And now want to check to see
if AngularUI is actually

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.890
available via Bower.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.990
So I'm just going to type in,
Bower search AngularUI.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.110
And as we can see, it's
already up there.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.360
So I can now just run Bower
install, save, AngularUI.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.410
And there it's gone
and installed it.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.030
So all we need to do now is just
add some references to

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.380
the AngularUI stylesheet and
script within our index file.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.490
So components AngularUI
build, AngularUI.css.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.505
And let's add a reference
to our script as well.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:47.790
So script src equals components,
Angular UI build,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.220
angularUI.js--

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.810
fantastic.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.500
And the last two dependencies we
need are jQuery and jQuery

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.330
UI, which I'm going to just wire
up using some references

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.070
to copies that are
hosted on a CDN.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.060
So there we go.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.100
We've got jQuery 1.9.1,
jQuery UI 1.10.2.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.770
And I've now saved them
in my index file.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.420
So now that we have AngularUI
installed, we can add a

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.130
reference to it in
our app.js file.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.350
So let's head on
over to app.js.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.470
And inside our angular module,
we've just defined a new array

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.190
referencing UI.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.340
So we're going back to
our todos template.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.800
And I'm adding a div wrapper
around our todos with the UI

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.600
sortable property on there.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.340
And refreshing--

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.240
and let's try this out.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.660
Awesome.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.480
So as you can see now,
I'm able to sort my

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.090
different todo items.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.400
And that's working
on all new items.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.040
Let's add in a new item
and see if it works

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.810
on that one as well.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.130
So buy some unicorns--

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.770
perfect.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.780
As you can see, that's
working great.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.540
Now we can sort our todos,
and that works fantastic.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.870
So one thing you might notice
is that when we refresh the

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.620
page, any todo items that we've
created automatically

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.270
get reset, because they aren't
being persisted.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.750
Let's change that, so
they get saved to

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.440
local storage instead.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.790
This time we're going to install
the angular local

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.260
storage package--

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.510
so Bower install.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.530
There we go.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.920
And now we're just going
to wire it up

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.380
inside our index file.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:28.940
So src equals components,
angular local storage, angular

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.000
local storage.js.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.840
There we go.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.020
Now, going back to app.js, I
need to add a reference to

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.419
local storage modules.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.789
So inside the same array as
earlier, local storage module.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.150
And there we go.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.870
And inside our main.js file we
need to add a local reference

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.950
to local storage module.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.820
So we're going to call it local
store service, just so

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.840
we can access it inside
our controller.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.500
I'm going to comment out the
todos that I had earlier, the

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.230
ones that I hard coded in.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.180
And we're going to add some
code that's, first of all,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.870
going to read any existing todo
items from local storage.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.080
Under the todo name space, we're
going to then split them

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.980
up based on a new line character
so that we can get

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.860
back anything want
into our array.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.080
So todosInStore.split
based on new line.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.220
And then we're just going to
register a watch expression,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.395
so that we can keep our todo
items name space updated with

00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:27.640
a joined version of our todos.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:41.770
So watch, function, and
localStorageService.add todos,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.430
scope.todos.join.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.650
New line.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.250
Save and test that out.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.250
So now I'm going to create
some new todo items.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:10:01.850
So learn, AngularJS, add buy
some unicorns, add learn to

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.900
skateboard.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.870
And now let's refresh
the page.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:07.540
They're still there.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.790
Let's open up the Chrome dev
tools just to check if these

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.520
are being stored.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.170
So as you can see, they're
actually being persisted to

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.210
local storage, which
is fantastic.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.140
So now we have an application
that works.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.700
The next thing we want
to do is write some

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.080
unit tests for it.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.750
So let's comment out the code
that we just added and reset

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.100
back to the static ones that we
had earlier just to make it

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.640
easier to test for a moment.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.010
So I've got my original
todos array.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.620
And now I'm going to head on
over to my Karma unit tests

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:36.810
that were scaffolded out for
me when I ran yo angular.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.130
So I'm heading to main.js, and
here's some boilerplate code

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.410
for my unit tests.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.320
And we already have an assertion
here that says it

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.580
should expect a list of awesome
things in the scope.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.020
Now, awesome things, if you
remember, is that array we

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.580
initially had, which just
defined a few items to display

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.250
on the [? lo lo ?]

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.530
boilerplate page.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.380
Let's replace it with todos, as
we've now got a todos array

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.910
inside our scope.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.850
And as you can see, all I can
here is change this to check

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.660
on the todo items that I
find inside my scope.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.990
And I want to check that the
length is equal to three.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.320
Let's save that.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.990
Let's run Grunt test.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.840
What this is now going to do
is go and fire off Karma,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.130
which is going to run
our unit test.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.470
We've got a spec runner
running in the

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.930
background for us now.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.725
And that's really it.

00:11:19.725 --> 00:11:21.470
You can check to make sure
that your unit tests are

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.160
running correctly.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.230
Now, the next thing you'll
probably want to do is build a

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.700
production ready version of your
application linking to

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.240
your code, minifying and
concatentating your assets,

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.690
and handling any abstractions
you might be using, like

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.540
CoffeeScript, and creating an
optimized build that you can

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:36.970
push to production.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.800
So we can do this just by
running the Grunt command.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.660
And there we go.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.250
It's ready.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.560
Now, the final thing you might
want to be able to do is

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.010
deploy your application.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.480
You can customize your Grunt
project to deploy to pretty

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.710
much anywhere, whether it
be Google App Engine

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:52.580
or something else.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.740
But in this case, we're going
to deploy to Heroku.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.390
Now, I'm going to use another
Yeoman generator to save me

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.440
some time here.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.290
So I'm going to go back to the
command line, and I'm going to

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.070
run NPM install generator
Heroku.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.020
You normally have to go through
a number of steps to

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.230
push to Heroku, including
using get

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.570
to handle this process.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.060
But using this generator
save us a lot of time.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.170
As you can see, it's going and
it's installing any of the

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.550
dependencies that it needs.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.100
It should be done
in just a sec.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.980
I can now just clear my screen
and run yo heroku.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.200
Now, this is just going to
generate me some configuration

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.900
that I can copy to my Grunt file
for my Heroku deployment.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.680
So it's going to ask
me a question.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.720
Do I want a separate Git
repository in dist?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.600
I'm going to say yes.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.030
There we go.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.450
There's our configuration.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.580
Now, I just need to go and copy
paste this into my Grunt

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.660
file under the copy task.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.200
So there we go--

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.720
copying that over, back
into my text editor.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:53.820
Perfect.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.810
And now I just push my dist
directory, which contains the

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.790
production version of my
application to Heroku.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.020
And so let's CD into dist.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.135
And I can run Heroku
Apps Create.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.370
And now I just need to push it
to Heroku-- so get subtree

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.970
prefix dist, Heroku master.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.460
Perfect, and now it's done.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.630
Now here's a version of my
application that I pushed to

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.810
Heroku earlier.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.000
And that's it.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.730
I created a new application.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.850
I was able to use Yeoman to
basically scaffold it out,

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.660
build it, test it, and I pushed
it to Heroku, so I can

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.500
easily share it with
other people.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.710
Now, if you like what you saw
with Grunt there are actually

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.100
hundreds of Grunt tasks
available to help you achieve

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.140
lots of common development tasks
at build time, including

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.650
compiling your CoffeeScript,
or using something like

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.780
grunt-contrib-connect to hook
up your application to some

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.810
middleware, like
Express or PHP.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.030
If you like what you saw with
Bower, there's actually a

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.240
growing number of easily
installable packages on the

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.310
Bower registry.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.470
And the number of open source
projects supporting it and

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.330
using it are growing weekly.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.380
Bower is great for handling
dependency management for you.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.760
So if you want to easily update
your dependencies, you

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:10.510
just run Bower Update, and
it does it for you.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.500
And Yeoman has a growing
number of generators

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.930
available on NPM.

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.620
We actually have over 50
available at the moment.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.630
And they're not just useful for
kickstarting off brand new

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.850
applications.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.520
Yeoman can be used to scaffold
out little bits of

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.730
applications, as well.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.890
So if you wanted to create a new
Angular view or directive,

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.750
you could actually just use the
same Angular scaffold that

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.720
I showed you earlier to create
that at the command line.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.550
We've got generators available
for Backbone, Angular, Ember,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:39.140
and a growing number of
different frameworks.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.110
So feel free to check out NPM if
you'd like to get some more

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.840
of those generators installed.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.040
And that's it.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.150
If you'd like to learn more
about Yeoman, please feel free

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.590
to check us out at yeoman.io.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.130
Until next time, thanks,
and goodbye.
