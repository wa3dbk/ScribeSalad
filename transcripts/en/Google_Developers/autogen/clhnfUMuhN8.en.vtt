嗨KRISTAN UCCELLO: Hi. 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.250
 My name is Krispy My name's Krispy. 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.460
 I am a developer promoting the relationship of the foundry development team. I'm a Developer Advocate on the Cast Developer Relations team. 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.480
 In this DevBytes video I will discuss In this DevBytes video, I will discuss 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.490
 About Google Cast TV stick content and Google Cast receivers and how development 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.369
 How the development content works with the receiving device works with Cast receiver devices. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.160
 For this video I assume that you have already for this video, I'm assuming you're already 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.330
 Familiar with the developer console familiar with the Cast developer console. 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.630
 If not, please check the developer console documentation If not, please review the developer console documentation. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.510
 Now let's see what the receiver application is, let's take a look at what a receiver application is. 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.119
 The receiving application is just a single-page HTML5 application. The terminal receiver applications are single-page HTML5 apps. 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.070
 It loads from a web URL that are loaded from a network URL 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 And run on a special version of Chrome and execute on a special version of Chrome. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.660
 The receiver application runs on the receiver device. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.000
 For example, Chrome Cast TV stick like a Chrome Cast. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.810
 Elements such as Button links and alert Elements such as buttons, links, and alerts 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.090
 Since there is no mouse or keyboard device available has been disabled since there's no mouse or keyboard 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.300
 Will be disabled input available. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.170
 All interactions associated with the recipient application All interactions with a running Cast receiver application 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.950
 The messages generated by the sender application happen through messages sent by a Cast sender app. 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.674
 To illustrate this interaction model To illustrate this interaction model, 

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:58.530
 Let's take a look at how a receiver application is launched. Let's take a look at how a Cast receiver application is launched. 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.270
 The situation is that such a tank receiver applications are launched 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.080
 When a sender runs an application when a Cast sender application running 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.000
 On a sender device such as a phone, tablet, or computer when running on a sender device such as a mobile phone tablet or computer 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.300
 It tells a receiver device that it needs to launch an application tells a receiver device that it wants to launch an application. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.224
 What is the application to launch depends on What that application is depends on the application ID 

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:14.930
 The application ID provided by the sender when requesting the use of the recipient device that the sender provides when requesting to use the receiver device. 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.710
 The recipient device will look for the Google service and The receiver device will look up the application ID using 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 Load the corresponding recipient application ID a Google service and load the corresponding receiver 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.670
 Application associated with it. 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 Once the receiver application is loaded, Once the receiver application is loaded, 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.110
 It can start from the connected senders it can start processing messages from the connected sender 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.250
 Processing information applications. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.872
 As a developer you can choose As a developer, you have options when 

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:33.930
 The type of sender involved in the receiver application initiated comes to the type of receiver application launched by a sender. 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 An application ID is an application ID that is a unique ID for a receiver application on the Cast Developer Console. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.420
