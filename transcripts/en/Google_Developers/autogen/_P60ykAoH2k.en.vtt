00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 it's good we continue in this nursery probos 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.490
 2013 Bogota edition the live previous to the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.589
 grand finale the great we are living 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.449
 his impressive successes comes the 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.699
 great final and I want to meet the 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.470
 exactly winner and you who are there 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.390
 connected that you were seeing in the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 social approach of course each of 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.130
 the comments you can continue talking 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.630
 next to us defining and detecting 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.859
 and visualizing everything that is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.019
 occurring in each of the groups 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.790
 enjoying with us of course of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.580
 all the technology of google it is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 here in the Colombian ecosystem in favor 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.660
 of SMEs in favor of these firms 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.880
 we are building the regional 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 applications and of course as you 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.050
 may have been able to see on the day of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.100
 yesterday in the presentation they are very 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.420
 interesting so it's up to us the subject of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.560
 google + the subject is also touched to go 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.300
 integrating different elements of 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.030
 youtube we are on the day of the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.800
 black integration correctly day of 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 the integration all groups by 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.910
 supposedly very nervously giving the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.080
 final details of each of your 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.990
 Projects 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 and delineating refining the back much more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 end of course also in the details 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.370
 of the front end and on the day of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.720
 good integration by placing the feet already 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.300
 Some of the groups are working 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 on prediction and foot and yes and here we go 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.230
 to see now some concepts of how 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.660
 make it more social about how to place the 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.860
 walk button haining some parts 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.260
 of javascript 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.600
 a little html we are also going to see 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.700
 how to connect to the youtube channel 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
 analytic of the youtube channel was cited 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 because I'm good that's also very 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.370
 important when we have scenarios 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.440
 multimedia detect if bring the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.550
 videos see how many views we have like this 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.250
 what are we going to do very easy 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.380
 authorizing us to youtube and in this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.330
 case version 3 since it brings some 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 very interesting features and for 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.729
 Of course we are going to keep going 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.950
 groups follows the spy camera too 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.620
 follow in second you will also be able 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.390
 detect with that 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.780
 you were wind that in the first the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.460
 alive two couples have danced good one 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.530
 of them has won that was the couple 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.240
 number one couple number two did not have 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.430
 the necessary votes so what 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.690
 let's do is check the code together 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.520
 one of the mentors already saw it to mayer 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 Over there 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.180
 concentrated so go out there I was 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 also turning around so we're going to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.860
 analyze the code of these two groups 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.040
 the couple was made up of 8 and 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.960
 the 10th remember so let's review 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640
 the application also they and you that 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.870
 you're connected there, you'll say they're going to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.940
 do now because I'm watching I'm 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.790
 preparing the popcorn they said some 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 of those in the virtual audience of the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 person becomes increasingly fun 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.870
 the one of belo forgiveness and we combine code 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.030
 technique with fun of course and you 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.610
 successes later I tell you if a 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.040
 tremendous challenge let's play a 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.990
 virtual game if we are going to play a game 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.570
 virtual is also built with 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.580
 html5 very interesting with our elves 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.400
 you will be able to live live comes the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.990
 challenge to see how many in a few more you're going to 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.650
 play paco 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.510
 let's see where that comes from 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.220
 comes the great challenge so that you 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.370
 you are there connected to the proposal is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.780
 integration code we are going to have fun 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.640
 also socially and let's see what 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.520
 is happening with the groups we are going to 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.860
 ask also about how they feel 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.900
 because if the grand finale arrives they are 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.670
 minutes of presenting an application that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.480
 work and that helps SMEs 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.610
 regional exactly 4 34 30 pm hour 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.980
 from bogotá we remember the use of -5 what 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.080
 you can find very simple in 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.270
 google developers is an event the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.160
 grand finale here in colombia so no 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.840
 you worry you can also follow by 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.880
 course the developer community 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.350
 and everything goes much much much more than 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.610
 3,700 successes and of course 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.790
 google developers also that follows 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.890
 growing you put +1 tennis also like 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.560
 followers as a follower and they are more than 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.940
 13,000 buses and taxis that impressive 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.110
 lot of developers in 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.120
 Latin America that are accompanying us 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.680
 and of course for us it is a 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.760
 pleasure so we remind you that and you 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.070
 we remember that all the news 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.019
 also and minute minutes are lived 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.549
 money 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.040
 along with the portal that has even 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.720
 the projects the teams and all the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.169
 information not only from Bogota but 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.760
 also from Buenos Aires of my city of 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.280
 mexico protest all the videos 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.280
 also that we were enjoying sao 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.060
 paulo record of poland paola the earth 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.639
 of the samba is vallenato there will be 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.289
 samba whether it is spoken or cited like that 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.090
 well it will be good 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.699
 we concentrate then we go to 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.620
 heat engines the stage comes 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.139
 technical the conversation with the 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.850
 mentors the challenge comes too and 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.860
 let's evaluate code so we 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.350
 we prepare we prepare ourselves 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.990
 we concentrate and we are already in second 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.250
 with much more if well approved 2013 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.250
 edit vote 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.360
 well we continue in this nursery post 2013 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.639
 Bogota edition here enjoying with the 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.900
 group of course and all the adrenaline 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.270
 technological to you that are there 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.370
 connected to you who are there told me 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.840
 you have to modify the 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.760
 nomenclature what you are saying to voice 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.560
 to you so I'm talking to you 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.210
 you are there connected yes we continue 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.100
 enjoying all that adrenaline and 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.040
 We continue talking with the groups but 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.479
 paco would like to see a bit to see what happens 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.910
 in the social network because we are 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:25.139
 accompanying are commenting there are some 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:28.160
 requests that are asking us to 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.610
 the camera is think go to group number 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:38.520
 99 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:41.170
 let's see to see let's see for the 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.840
 group number 9 to see if it arrives 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:48.650
 I need help look how it takes 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.860
 as we are there, we greet group 9 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.000
 barbarian group number 9 we can send 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.320
 what are they doing now that they are 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.160
 making see if we can see their 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.160
 computers 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:05.460
 9 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.460
 there it is to see well 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:12.189
 with respect to the maps it seems that yes 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.189
 that makes sense 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.069
 look what barbarian of course good is going to 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.569
 follow of course much more camera in 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.249
 I live for ccoo we have some other 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.259
 message and then tell us to see if 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:26.990
 there's more social effect but let's see 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:29.119
 very quickly because it's coming at 4 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.249
 30pm and do not miss the grand finale 

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:32.779
 come the jurors are evaluating all 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:35.270
 the applications technically we have 

00:07:32.779 --> 00:07:37.339
 technical evaluation criteria 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.589
 criteria of course of entrepreneur 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:42.110
 also to complete this tremendous 

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:44.719
 application that is totally left 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.729
 available on open source license and 

00:07:44.719 --> 00:07:49.369
 for all regional SMEs very 

00:07:46.729 --> 00:07:51.619
 important so in this nursery post 

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.969
 2013 to whom in the Bogota edition and in 

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:55.099
 all Latin America we are telling 

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.050
 contribute directly to this 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:59.360
 tremendous ecosystem of regional SMEs 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.309
 more than 99 percent of the companies in 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.439
 Latin America are SMEs as we are not going to 

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:05.119
 contribute buses milestones and more than 30 

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:06.499
 ecosystems and with all the potential of 

00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.309
 the technologies of google nor by 

00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:09.559
 supposed 

00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:11.120
 so come with me your successes let's go 

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:13.639
 watching quickly 

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.550
 and let's do a javascript review 

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:18.740
 with html to integrate google + all the 

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.510
 potential of the social approach also 

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.729
 that many of the groups are also 

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.620
 using to not make that record to 

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:26.030
 somewhat more tedious times of a 

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.889
 form with last name is no longer 

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.630
 authentic moss socially and of that 

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:30.860
 way we start to interact that is 

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.330
 one of the most important things and that 

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.070
 they are here I am quickly showing 

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.560
 so that developers can 

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.210
 locate all this potential where you searched 

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.159
 information about google + and how 

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:42.740
 integrate it very simple very good developers 

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:45.020
 dot google.com reference address 

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:48.380
 reference address for every bar 

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.080
 more bar more so saying perfect very 

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.480
 we can well find out why all 

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.790
 the information as initial how to do 

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.620
 that secure authentication that we decide 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.620
 the curp haining them in which with the 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.800
 ping button we click and we 

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.820
 authenticates moss in the post social network 

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.339
 interactive good how we integrate 

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:09.170
 with padlock there is also a simple way 

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:11.900
 to integrate into hangouts and generate 

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.540
 applications or extensions so that I 

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.080
 I'm doing a 

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.510
 video conference I'm talking 

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.580
 with someone can start to interact 

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:21.920
 today we will see very quickly the 

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.380
 first of the examples yes but they have 

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.390
 all the information here available and 

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.820
 they are going to what platform they are going to 

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.920
 be working and example javascript 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.720
 so that you can use I want 

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:37.180
 do only one shortcut 

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.670
 to the skin and very simple look here now 

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.389
 I'm working on one of the 

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.209
 examples 

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:45.310
 I have google + that open and the code 

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:48.730
 number one good what basically does 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:50.410
 this code is to login with a 

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.139
 button let's see how it is built 

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.760
 this yes very quickly here what 

00:09:53.139 --> 00:09:57.550
 let's find 

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.460
 here we have some of the little things 

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.730
 let's look for that code because we have 

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:05.200
 many files 

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.420
 All shipping of course we show it to you 

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.840
 notice how fast and how simple we are 

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.040
 to do here I have the code 1 html point 

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.110
 I'm showing you we have a 

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.730
 rendering function here what 

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.500
 we are using of course is the bugle 

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.140
 there is that we are locating the same 

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.790
 project that was commenting 

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:23.830
 previously and with the same number by 

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.720
 Of course this is part of the api 

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.430
 google to be part of the whole console 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.410
 that we are talking about all the services 

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:31.540
 that is available google so much 

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.790
 I have to generate a project for me or if I already 

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.680
 I have a project and go activate the 

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.160
 console and that's what we show them 

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:42.040
 also in the previous broadcast I will go 

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.050
 to the console here I have all my 

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.110
 projects located one of the projects 

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:49.810
 within space and author and authentication 

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.760
 authorization yes here I have all the 

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.320
 feet notice that for you to 

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.140
 functions I have to have of course 

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.330
 enabled on the google chrome display and 

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.710
 we started to see then the 

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.050
 first data that we place is the 

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:03.480
 training 

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.910
 we have to feel the scout in this 

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.750
 case the scope that we are using is 

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.430
 login 

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:11.070
 because we are going to make an ass sign in without 

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.510
 nothing more than that and then good once 

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:16.470
 that I have these entities or I have something of 

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.750
 style that is is lateral with 

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.100
 of course the branding debuts them so that 

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.480
 you see the little button as you 

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.760
 they know that we can vary the 

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.060
 according to the official branding and finally 

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:30.060
 we have only one dip that does the 

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.890
 call to this zenit bulla is very simple 

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.560
 what we are showing you, notice that 

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:39.149
 here we have the function that this 

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:41.339
 operation is very very simple how to 

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:43.680
 that in which I can use asses 

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:45.360
 sajnín so this one the proposal that 

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.970
 we are bringing very 

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.100
 quickly how to authorize us and 

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.720
 start working with google + haining 

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.519
 it's that simple, I'm already of course 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.459
 I do not have any more operations to perform 

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:59.790
 in this case but it identifies me and of that 

00:11:56.459 --> 00:12:01.709
 way I can already tell you that I am such or 

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.779
 which authentic person something very useful 

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:05.430
 for the applications that are here for 

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:07.529
 course and that's what it's about 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.999
 that's why we were sharing it 

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:10.499
 you can see we are going to upload this 

00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:12.509
 code that is very small and that 

00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:14.399
 really provide very much functionality 

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:16.230
 interesting and in fact remember that 

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:18.509
 our portal has this technology 

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.490
 also of course so, so we must 

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:22.439
 see two points with google.com for 

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.540
 course so for ccoo as well that 

00:12:22.439 --> 00:12:26.610
 social network there are messages like that we 

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.600
 they are saying that we are beginning to have 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:34.259
 public support for teams and Ivan 

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.079
 wheels by number 7 wicks by the 

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:39.209
 number 8 then make your predictions 

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:41.189
 and friends tell us what team they like 

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:43.740
 to win this developer you who 

00:12:41.189 --> 00:12:46.589
 will win who will win not like we were 

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:48.930
 with that but well then we follow a 

00:12:46.589 --> 00:12:53.910
 little bit more and neither is telling us anymore 

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:55.800
 in detail how they are bouncing all the 

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.850
 audience you're there connected to 

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.009
 each of the groups having the 

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.689
 good preference those votes add up are going to 

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:02.069
 be taken into account of course is 

00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:03.350
 true in fact you have to remind 

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:05.090
 all that 

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.520
 one of the ratings one of the 

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:10.720
 seven grades that receive the 

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.460
 groups is the number of votes in their 

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.440
 team publications then vote 

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.940
 for the one that they like the best they can 

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.680
 vote for several also if they like 

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:20.180
 more of a clearing of course so it's 

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.860
 very important because it is part of the 

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.230
 qualification so surely the 

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.450
 groups are going to get very happy yes 

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:29.150
 yes they are supporting them externally and the 

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.640
 dance also add dance pole 

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.650
 also sum and good clear out there 

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.810
 until it is not the valuation of 

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.400
 project but yes in that social framework 

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.970
 I think so because it helps that they have a 

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.170
 +1 go away be well follow more one 

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.970
 exactly so well we follow a 

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.290
 little reviewing we quickly saw a 

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.150
 javascript bit 

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.620
 very small that allows me to be the ass 

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:53.480
 zhenning with some very simple styles 

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.970
 but we also want to talk a little bit about 

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.950
 what happens with youtube that is 

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.690
 basically the demo that we're going to see 

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.040
 it has to do with the analytical that 

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:03.320
 we can do many things we can 

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.210
 edit a playlist we can work 

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.800
 different activities with respect to 

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.390
 the videos that is very important the 

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.710
 multimedia scenario we do not have great 

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.810
 number of solutions 

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.850
 that can be based on videos that 

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.920
 there are nowadays that are millions of 

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.110
 videos that are happening daily by 

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.820
 by youtube that are playing and 

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.900
 that we can get that 

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.430
 information I will show you by 

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.580
 course then something called topic 

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:28.100
 explorer also in which uses the 

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:30.590
 youtube play and also use something that 

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.870
 call freebase and then we can 

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.670
 detect the knowledge if from 

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.530
 youtube for example let's use the 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.270
 use my channel if not the channel 

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.480
 personal and based on what I'm going 

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:43.910
 looking in the channel is going to detect me 

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.520
 concepts those concepts seek them 

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.200
 freebase yes they are objects in triads 

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.350
 person objects for the general public 

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.910
 they are objects and it returns me if the quantity 

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.440
 of objects that represent those 

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.690
 concepts that I have in my channel 

00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:00.770
 Let's imagine that I like to see I do not know 

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:02.570
 for example musical themes of vallenato 

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.630
 for example to learn to dance 

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.980
 vallenato good because not if it would have 

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.750
 that represent that so very 

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.280
 interesting good to see then 

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.050
 quickly here we have prepared 

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.110
 let's see something from a collage of 

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:17.750
 very simple analytics on the html 

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:22.310
 to show here this synthetic removes I say 

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:25.100
 it's good to basically search the channel 

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.829
 if I search the videos of my channel 

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.779
 I have to select one of the videos and 

00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:33.470
 based on that generate me a graph of 

00:15:29.779 --> 00:15:35.480
 contest the foot that demonstrates a 

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.190
 number of visits or regularity 

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.810
 irregularity of the visits that I 

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:43.149
 we had how this is built we go 

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:45.550
 to use our of your successes because 

00:15:43.149 --> 00:15:48.589
 then we keep integrating look 

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.180
 we quickly see the code here we're going to 

00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:52.430
 see it also a little more in detail 

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.320
 because it is also important that we go 

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.810
 detecting each of the parties step to 

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.640
 I pass the exact recipe within html not 

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.130
 we have nothing but all the magic does 

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.360
 this javascript that we have here and here 

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.940
 we have the integration as you 

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:08.269
 will be able to see again use the 

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:11.240
 client the clan there is of the scouts I follow 

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:13.550
 it tends again what areas I need 

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.529
 to give instructions to the entity and 

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.690
 concrete note that after I'm already 

00:16:15.529 --> 00:16:19.760
 working with some formulas here 

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.010
 authorized that it is part foundation 

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.500
 here it is already authorized because we are 

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.850
 manipulating it here live but good and 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.370
 after we are handling the 

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.080
 results and in this very simple way 

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.780
 I can go detecting here we have the 

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.420
 concrete integration if loading the 

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:39.170
 foot law interface here we also have 

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:40.820
 the the return of the channel of the 

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.770
 user as I told them in this case 

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.240
 of course we are using my channel 

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.580
 because I'm authorizing here is 

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.590
 complete the answer we are seeing 

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.660
 here we have for example the return 

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.730
 of the playlist because we could 

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:55.160
 work with some specific videos 

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.240
 with some particular playlist that 

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.980
 course it is depending on what 

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.890
 programming we are giving you here 

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:03.080
 we are returning the metadata of those 

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.480
 videos is very important that you 

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.579
 can detect and analyze each of 

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.110
 these lines because within the goal 

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:10.850
 data there is a lot of information from the videos 

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:12.829
 we can know if a video is musical if 

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.170
 a video is about culture if a video is 

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:17.810
 accepted technology technology in 

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.490
 reality based on that we can get 

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.990
 a lot of knowledge information from 

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.760
 what is happening in the channel and by 

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.190
 we name them here live yes 

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.890
 then that is important and good final 

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.860
 here we are showing with this function 

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:34.970
 the analytics 

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:38.660
 of concrete data if it's a bit long 

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:40.010
 to detail all the code but 

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.200
 finally for you to understand 

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:45.110
 here we have the integration with charts and 

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.840
 in this way if we already round xii of 

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:50.240
 we outlined the development completely 

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.370
 authorize us let's bring the channel a 

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.870
 Once we have the channel, we detect that 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.940
 Video playlist we can make you a 

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.670
 click to that click we react with 

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.410
 uncharted skin that populates data from 

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:03.020
 the analytics of that video 

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.730
 it's that simple we have this 

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.410
 development that we are seeing here that 

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.120
 we analyze of course in a very 

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.220
 simple through those of toulouse 

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.570
 there this seems like always 

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.160
 it seemed very useful lic 

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:15.440
 again very useful for some 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.169
 applications to be here of course 

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:20.480
 that we're going to keep seeing some 

00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:23.450
 more parts the analysis of the 

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:25.580
 code of the groups and the one who lost the 

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.940
 challenge of valleys comes a new challenge 

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:31.070
 it was quoted there is another challenge there is another challenge but 

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.039
 before I want to see to see where it is 

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.679
 to the camera our camera spy where 

00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:40.009
 is 

00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:43.759
 one-on-one 

00:18:40.009 --> 00:18:46.340
 code code so I do not know where to 

00:18:43.759 --> 00:18:48.970
 will also be there we are like this in the 

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.970
 group 9 

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:53.830
 well you can also vote for 

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:58.880
 supposed 

00:18:53.830 --> 00:19:01.370
 where are we connected to 

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.120
 do promotion as yes exactly but 

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.179
 their successes 

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:07.820
 if I present the challenge to you if we are going to do 

00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:10.759
 recharge our browser 

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.919
 if you think we are going to play role and that 

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:15.350
 it seems to play role and we go to quality and 

00:19:12.919 --> 00:19:18.110
 software roll it look quickly I 

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.610
 I have here this device is a cable 

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.129
 that I'm going to take out only for you 

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:24.080
 you can see on the screen though I'll see 

00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:24.919
 what is he doing if the person who 

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.259
 has the browser 

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:29.629
 still play roll it and that has to do 

00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:31.940
 with all the groups here who lose 

00:19:29.629 --> 00:19:33.830
 roll it with me and let's review the 

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.039
 code we also check the 

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.039
 two 

00:19:36.149 --> 00:19:42.639
 so let's play of course here 

00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:45.700
 in the browser 

00:19:42.639 --> 00:19:47.289
 well this is a difficult opponent 

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.120
 I say I'm a tremendous opponent, good 

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:50.080
 yes, notice that quickly we're going to 

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.049
 watch 

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:56.279
 quickly we're going to go so we're going to 

00:19:53.049 --> 00:19:56.279
 go look in the browser 

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:03.739
 to roddick 

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:07.190
 We're looking to go by phone 

00:20:03.739 --> 00:20:09.590
 here it is very important that we see it and 

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:11.359
 Who are you going to play with? Let's play but 

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.429
 that's going to come in second 

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:15.859
 let's play role and from here with 

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:17.450
 Some of the participants could be 

00:20:15.859 --> 00:20:19.759
 vote on the social network who wants that 

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:21.739
 play against the group that broker then 

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:24.889
 high vote which group you want to play 

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:26.989
 each role and with me we will throw yes for 

00:20:24.889 --> 00:20:29.330
 course of the rolling and the one that adds more 

00:20:26.989 --> 00:20:31.789
 share points and two opponents per 

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:34.009
 supposedly good wins and is not reviewed the 

00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:36.499
 good code loses its successes you know 

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:38.539
 how are the rules here and we slide and 

00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:40.639
 we work the look so we have left 

00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:42.379
 two very important things we have left 

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:44.359
 go through the groups we are left 

00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:46.099
 supposed to evaluate the code of it the 

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:48.649
 team that has already lost in the challenge of 

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:50.359
 couple that I do not dance well well so 

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:52.820
 those two groups we are going to analyze on 8 

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:54.320
 and the 10th remembering and we're going to play roll 

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.179
 it live with you and we continue 

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.979
 enjoying the code we continue 

00:20:56.179 --> 00:21:00.409
 enjoying this adrenaline we continue 

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:01.370
 enjoying the ecosystem of Bogotá 

00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:03.890
 what 

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:06.559
 engines to prepare you because it's coming 

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:11.200
 the challenge and we continue with much more 

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:11.200
 money in 2013 management votes 

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:29.850
 good morning my name is the laughs I am 

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:32.130
 the uncle recycles your mind like the 

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.350
 team number 8 and for us one of 

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.429
 the strongest competencies that exists 

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.909
 as programmers 

00:21:36.429 --> 00:21:41.769
 the cloud team but they are not so good 

00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:44.340
 competition as the number one team 

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:46.340
 who has presented a solution 

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.650
 integrator 

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.779
 and easy access to the community that 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.669
 gives a solution to a big problem 

00:21:50.779 --> 00:21:54.950
 globally that is the problem of 

00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:57.590
 hello cooperativism my name is michael 

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:01.210
 martínez I am from group 7 our 

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:03.130
 project is called best place 

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.080
 We believe that we have a new project in 

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:08.470
 that moment here within the 

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.730
 convocation despite the fact that the others 

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.760
 projects are also very good but 

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:14.679
 we have really wanted to do this and 

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.929
 I really think we're going to 

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:18.760
 channel hello my name is cristian al 

00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:21.130
 I am part of the yale team 

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.340
 business and well the competition 

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.559
 here in the develop boiler I think that 

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.470
 everyone has shown great talent 

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:31.630
 everyone has a lot of capacity to 

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:33.100
 develop a good project and ideas 

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.809
 that you have seen are very good inside me 

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.909
 I think they are all competences 

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:40.840
 really hello my name is Jesus 

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:44.770
 contreras I belong to group 5 and so 

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:47.289
 we really think that the teams are 

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:49.600
 good there are very good teams but 

00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:51.370
 We have the best product and we know that 

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.440
 is going to be the best application my name 

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:56.580
 is what they did and claw in our group 

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.850
 it's called one it 

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.440
 and then many groups with very good 

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.510
 proposals that respected has very 

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.430
 good proposals but especially I think 

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:10.810
 that the davis plus proposal 

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.810
 I think it's very good 

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.289
 okay, we still enjoy this 

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.450
 live it but you 2013 here in Bogota 

00:23:28.289 --> 00:23:31.889
 among them college campus 

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.330
 sergio grove bank especially 

00:23:31.889 --> 00:23:36.179
 thank all of course 

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.399
 our technological friends not if it is 

00:23:36.179 --> 00:23:40.559
 mine that juries now get inside 

00:23:38.399 --> 00:23:42.659
 little because the assessment is coming 

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:44.549
 end of the applications the winner to 

00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:46.320
 silicon valley of colombia fac very 

00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:48.570
 true very true the winner goes with 

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.909
 us up silicon valley where 

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.450
 we have a very special event that 

00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:55.540
 they will spend incredible 

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.140
 well it's time to play we're going to 

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.640
 analyze 

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.710
 I think we analyze the code 

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:04.900
 first we play first eggs 

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:07.060
 first and then let's ask 

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:10.330
 second to know if someone has any 

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.970
 preference yes and if not I went down to look 

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.410
 directly went down search because here 

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.940
 it's very important let's play roll it 

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:21.120
 so it was accompanied by some 

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.120
 preference 

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:29.050
 recite me 

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:33.360
 recíclame a nick against jesse work there 

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:36.580
 two against and sword and against recycle 

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.480
 yes work is around here who plays 

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.480
 on this side 

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:47.610
 and do not worry 

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.950
 for playing 

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.930
 that's why I feel like I saw it there 

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.240
 as saying I'm scared because neither 

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.830
 is a heavyweight in role is first time 

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.140
 I play it but I'm going to give it a fight 

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:59.520
 do not worry do not worry we are 

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.170
 they are good so 

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.910
 alone and I also the first time 

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.530
 I play it so I can not think of a lie 

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.970
 do not worry voices and middle tone like that 

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:09.150
 to accompany me here come here 

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:11.010
 let's play role and conget war come 

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:13.590
 around here we are going to quickly 

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.470
 convert comment to the public here 

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.630
 we left and we are already seeing buses and 

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.220
 we are all seeing and we are seeing your 

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.990
 phone if you want to raise a little 

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.120
 yes yield and yes of course good here 

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:26.130
 we have the phone we will see that here 

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.330
 we have it of course we are going to look 

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:30.090
 as you can see if you to this 

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:32.780
 and selecting things and here software 

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:35.940
 roll it roll it is very simple avant 

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:38.010
 rolling has to do with invoking things 

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.890
 if we are going to invoke coins and who takes out 

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:43.080
 more points yes of course whoever is 

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.669
 who more point in that context 

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.380
 winning the challenge is very simple 

00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:52.410
 let's show we are in the browser 

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:55.920
 now let's go to the 2.0 bar phone 

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:58.680
 roll it yes here we have it let's go to 

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.710
 see what I put wrong 

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.320
 graus there we go very large fabrics ni 

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:06.270
 I have very big fingers and I have two very 

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.310
 great and I'm writing badly I'm 

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:11.420
 writing badly I have a problem myself 

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.420
 I need to spend 

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.250
 we have a little problem because it's not 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.870
 I can enter the roll it 

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:22.350
 because I'm writing badly 

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.820
 nobody had put me what happened what happened 

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:27.600
 that is a lot of challenge here a lot 

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.720
 g.co challenge yes let's talk the 

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.370
 shortener and roll 

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.559
 here we already have this code here is not 

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:36.059
 asking you can you see we are going to 

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:40.650
 put that way what I'm doing 

00:26:36.059 --> 00:26:42.690
 my phone we have to put the code 

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:48.260
 so that we are playing with world 

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:48.260
 broker if through html not 

00:26:49.309 --> 00:26:53.210
 and we already have the activation notice that 

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.340
 you are looking to the right what 

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.289
 I'm doing here on the phone in 

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.879
 the phone we see perfect ok and to the 

00:26:57.289 --> 00:27:00.379
 side will see what is happening 

00:26:58.879 --> 00:27:02.809
 in the browser so let's choose 

00:27:00.379 --> 00:27:04.580
 notice that I move the phone if 

00:27:02.809 --> 00:27:06.559
 You can choose the number of plays of 

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.269
 players if your phone looks if 

00:27:06.559 --> 00:27:11.809
 you want we can take out the window of your 

00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:14.029
 phone and we see roll it roll and which 

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:16.879
 he wants to see this we take out this s we take 

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:20.600
 we get this ok and we play with 2 a 

00:27:16.879 --> 00:27:22.309
 who since 2 we are going to play first 

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.190
 I'm going to play, let's say first 

00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:26.629
 quickly to teach the Lord I 

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:31.460
 Let's go forward 

00:27:26.629 --> 00:27:35.920
 here comes to money 

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:38.950
 and good but very bad very bad 

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:43.990
 very bad very bad with a little more than 

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:45.820
 strength was younger very young but that 

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:49.420
 long ago we go again with a little 

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.910
 more than strength there is almost hit 50 a 

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:56.050
 little bit more to see 10 points for me in 

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:58.710
 points how many shots after 30 for 30 min 

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.710
 we're still pulling 

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:07.550
 I'm with the next one is adding 

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:11.210
 and we're close to them I have 32 left 

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:14.510
 shots again let's see to see come 

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:21.950
 three shots to see if I can calibrate it 

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:26.150
 what happened I already lost but I come very badly 

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:28.040
 lack force lack force will pass pass 

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.650
 more arepa 

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.440
 or very strong or very very slowly let's say 

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:38.980
 I already have 40 points only it seems that 

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.980
 is saved and sword that I think there 

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:46.880
 no no I did not break it good player 2 and in the 

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:50.680
 sir come here an unfortunate in 

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.680
 the lucky game in the dance 

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:56.400
 do not bother him a bit do not worry 

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:06.100
 well this is good it bothers a little and 

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:08.680
 he left that I need it follows 

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:14.760
 bothering a little and it's work and it's work 

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:14.760
 there he went again he lost he won 

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.720
 has more pull 

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:27.790
 nothing is nervous the days are approaching 

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.980
 is disconnecting the cable 

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:33.100
 is commenting on xerez is approaching with 

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:35.890
 I'm going to do this, I do not understand and 

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:41.170
 he fell that he has no more shots 

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:43.299
 in Argentina for now no no no no longer 

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:48.820
 it was that the 

00:29:43.299 --> 00:29:52.450
 well no, nobody realized that I 

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:56.320
 win 40 30 thank you very much 

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:58.659
 stop and let's go more than barbarian we're going 

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.399
 to review the code also to you that 

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:02.230
 you are there having fun with us 

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:04.539
 you want someone else to play against me 

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:07.210
 want to challenge you can vote for 

00:30:04.539 --> 00:30:08.619
 supposed to vote it so good 

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.690
 as you will see we continue to see 

00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:12.580
 code we keep having fun in this 

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.639
 duel but you 2013 and the moment arrives 

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:18.129
 to see the technical part I'm going to call it 

00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:20.379
 out there we have mayer come come by 

00:30:18.129 --> 00:30:22.570
 here our mentor there is one of the 

00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:23.470
 star mentors approaching next to 

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:27.429
 we 

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:30.460
 look here comes here comes does more ago 

00:30:27.429 --> 00:30:32.649
 a few minutes ago we were in another live 

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.590
 doing a dance game here the 

00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:37.779
 team 10 and team 8 lost the game 

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.609
 dance dance not a vallenato if you 

00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:41.859
 he missed it because it was awesome 

00:30:39.609 --> 00:30:43.929
 really this so now we're going to 

00:30:41.859 --> 00:30:45.789
 enter the repository if it seems to 

00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:47.139
 commenting on some things it is clear 

00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:48.890
 more or less the projects as they come 

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:51.470
 of group 10 

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.480
 and of group number 8 so the 

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:56.060
 second microphone stays here and here 

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:58.390
 let's go comment a little bit if 

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:01.370
 after this tremendous victory 

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:04.940
 tremendous victory in really I'm very 

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:07.130
 happy without cheating without cheating never by 

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.620
 your work this is totally like this we play 

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:14.170
 let's say you saw that you're there what 

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:14.170
 You saw me win in the whole law 

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.850
 well let's see here we have the repository 

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.080
 we are going to enter bogota 

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:24.860
 the presentation of the project we have the 

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:27.770
 project is going to move and it's work yes 19 

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:29.480
 hours ago he made the last comic so 

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:32.840
 well they are there they must be doing the 

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:35.299
 last arrangements not what happened not here 

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.340
 there was an extension yes 

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:39.409
 let's quickly see how you saw them 

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.700
 beyond this team let's say I'm going to 

00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:41.960
 go touching some squares of color and 

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.700
 some code segments 

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.149
 the guys yesterday were working 

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.869
 strong as trying to integrate with 

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:51.470
 jim ok 

00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:53.929
 'not with java on google app engine and 

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:56.149
 yesterday they had as difficulty is a little 

00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:57.889
 how they did not have a little battle with 

00:31:56.149 --> 00:32:00.169
 but today I saw them much more 

00:31:57.889 --> 00:32:02.539
 solid today I saw that they have as 

00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:04.429
 integrated all the cde cadafe in 

00:32:02.539 --> 00:32:07.009
 Chile is working very well and 

00:32:04.429 --> 00:32:09.019
 they could already integrate as the 

00:32:07.009 --> 00:32:10.519
 tata store to store the data for 

00:32:09.019 --> 00:32:11.480
 have as all the information as 

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:13.820
 saved on the infrastructure 

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.679
 scalable then they are on the right track 

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.659
 in that sense and they are starting how 

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:19.190
 put together the things that you see is to say 

00:32:17.659 --> 00:32:21.080
 they are trying to show us already 

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:23.480
 results try to show the 

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.070
 juries what they are capable of 

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.899
 do what good good I'm looking at 

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.369
 out let's see let's see I was 

00:32:26.899 --> 00:32:30.019
 seeing the extension you need and we 

00:32:28.369 --> 00:32:31.429
 will show and there we are good was 

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:34.029
 reviewing the extension below the 

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:36.249
 projects we said already work 

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:38.169
 here I saw the extension very quickly and 

00:32:36.249 --> 00:32:41.289
 here I am seeing the application in aena 

00:32:38.169 --> 00:32:44.229
 pen without seemingly we will see by 

00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:47.200
 example let's see the company jsp you 

00:32:44.229 --> 00:32:50.019
 it seems and we're going to look at the 

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.059
 code as well as you're seeing there we're going to 

00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:53.889
 criticize the code but always fine 

00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:55.539
 constructive me too from the network 

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:58.539
 social you can comment on the code 

00:32:55.539 --> 00:33:01.450
 knicks and notice there is usually a 

00:32:58.539 --> 00:33:03.039
 valuation of the people of vélez la 

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.509
 smudge code quality because there 

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:07.059
 we are seeing have the airs 

00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:10.389
 there are some tips here that I am seeing well 

00:33:07.059 --> 00:33:13.599
 Well, it is usually very good practice 

00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:15.440
 separate the entire presentation layer from 

00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:17.240
 the layer 

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.700
 logic that has to do with the bases 

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.650
 of data then 

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.210
 remember that I asked you in some 

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:24.670
 moment if you were using it as a 

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:27.310
 template templates engine is 

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.710
 normally it is necessary to do is 

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:31.300
 say your code improves and it's much more 

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.670
 easy to maintain to the extent that 

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:36.160
 you have those layers apart after having 

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:38.380
 some files where you have the html and 

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.300
 you can use a template engine 

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.460
 like jim and for example that makes you very 

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:44.620
 easy life to do all the 

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.780
 presentation logic repeat blocks 

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:49.360
 include other templates for 

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.430
 that you do not have to put the code of 

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.900
 java in this case within the center 

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.670
 let's say that is one of the parties as 

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.170
 important within the strategy that 

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.750
 you chose let's say that you 

00:33:56.170 --> 00:34:02.480
 they decided to create the entire application 

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:05.090
 including as the html code and 

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.770
 and let's say as the logical layer now to me 

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.629
 personally I like more the 

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:11.030
 applications where one has the 

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:13.970
 backend as totally clean and you 

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:16.250
 about that creates services services rest 

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:17.540
 what can you call, say, from a 

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:20.030
 application on android from a 

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.010
 application in javascript using as 

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.480
 many bookstores or even from a 

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.679
 desktop application from what you 

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.879
 you want the command line if you 

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:30.290
 it looks like a simile clouds wins true 

00:34:27.879 --> 00:34:32.720
 exactly as something that gives you service 

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.700
 it stands independently is totally like 

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.790
 you backend that is going to get you going 

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:39.649
 deliver data to whatever you call it 

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.580
 then that is a very good practice 

00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:42.530
 you left as if by a 

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.820
 strategy a little different under the 

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.159
 strategy that you used 

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:48.440
 let's say that what I would recommend 

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.690
 technically would be to try 

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:52.669
 separate the html code and use a 

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:54.889
 language as templates to organize 

00:34:52.669 --> 00:35:00.410
 a little better the thing that I value many 

00:34:54.889 --> 00:35:03.410
 thanks most impressive the return 

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:04.910
 of course how we accomplish successes 

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:08.000
 we fulfill why 

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:11.150
 they lost the challenge had to go see 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.549
 the source code and the but it was 

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:16.369
 constructive now let's see I invite you 

00:35:13.549 --> 00:35:18.470
 older let's see another one because the couple 

00:35:16.369 --> 00:35:20.960
 was satisfied by the number 10 

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.880
 you open them yes and by the number group 

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.619
 8 who is on his back the gentleman over there 

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.380
 they do not love us and look good 

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:28.700
 but that was fine there if I had 

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:30.349
 something to say sir to see come 

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.210
 come with me because I had something to say 

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:34.789
 Mr. and we go back to review the code 

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:39.950
 come with me and we will see omar if not 

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:41.450
 I remember if omar omar martín and something 

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:44.470
 to say how you lived about the 

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.470
 dance let's say why 

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:51.930
 very well very well clear 

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:53.609
 all very well and we saw something in the networks 

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:58.309
 social who were calling the bus 

00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:58.309
 success for him to dance already 

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:06.500
 and dance following all the 

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.450
 members to each of the duty or per 

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:12.230
 bus I want to get to our driver 

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:14.240
 dancing is very difficult with wheels but 

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:15.740
 buses we are going to experience that good 

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:18.290
 for let's review your code now 

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:21.170
 as it is already there so it receives 

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:23.000
 recyclable truth and recycle come 

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:25.430
 with me join me we continue we return to 

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.920
 throne seems this one works from that 

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:30.770
 we have here let's quickly see the 

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:35.470
 code we do have available in the 

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:38.230
 projects of the taca taca taca group 

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:39.580
 I have to check it you have to show a 

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.400
 little of the code or because this one I have not 

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:45.560
 still in detail today I would like 

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:50.260
 or find it to the code 

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:54.220
 ay albéniz and sword that disposed want it 

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:59.960
 ants but what happened to the group 

00:36:54.220 --> 00:37:03.460
 number 8 was quoted what happened that has 

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:06.440
 happened is the code here the code and 

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.160
 we had to review it and there is the 

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.440
 code 

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.120
 I want silence here to see what you think 

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.480
 the social network because what people think 

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.310
 your comments there to see to see what 

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.590
 is happening because he got the 

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.870
 review lost the dance challenge 

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:25.270
 they wanted to download with the vuce cited 

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:27.220
 saying the lights equals and I would say 

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:29.530
 that now they have to dance again that 

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.290
 dance again and dance again 

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.330
 then let's do it again is going to 

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.770
 return to dance group number 8 

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.660
 follow me around here but we have to 

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.910
 find a partner to love so 

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.640
 I come sea will have to dance again 

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:44.860
 because unfortunately he did not comply with the 

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.390
 challenge can choose some of its levels 

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.740
 but also so do not worry if 

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.500
 you want you can choose any of your 

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.720

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:08.070

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:16.869
 so who who has his partner 

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:18.339

00:38:16.869 --> 00:38:19.960
 July 

00:38:18.339 --> 00:38:23.319

 time to choose so we go that does not 

00:38:23.319 --> 00:38:29.079
 You can say that it is not like anybody 

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:31.630
 like fish in the water of payment July who 

00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:34.829
 who accompanies it can be any 

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.829

 approaching group number 4 and I see gray like that 

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:55.460
 what should be to see the project manager of 

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.100
 luxury 420 as long as it does not come with me 

00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:01.370

 probos 2013 watch follow the challenges 

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.770
 the challenges continue, group number 8 does not 

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:11.780
 fulfilled we reviewed the code was not in 

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.920
 the challenge of dancing again 

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.990
 to dance again 

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.750
 the vallenato is coming July is 

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:22.140
 prepared I have prepared that the 

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:23.540
 music voices milestone 20 seconds leads 

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:27.590
 we go 

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:31.390
 that comes the clear palm that comes the 

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:31.390
 palm down I know if all my speed 

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:40.300
 that's fine 

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.760
 the cricket fell in love with the law of command 

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:47.010
 glory 

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.010
 if it goes well back 

00:39:51.430 --> 00:40:02.990
 there is a big hug for July then 

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:05.390
 I tell you I tell the boy too 

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:07.040
 we really saw the steps of the 

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.660
 vallenato I'm learning how to 

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.580
 to dance vallenato too so very 

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:12.650
 interesting this good we're going to take 

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.720
 a few seconds we go down takes a few seconds 

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:17.360
 and we have a lot more to offer you 

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:20.510
 still in this previous one is prior to the 

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.520
 grand finale that comes in 430 voices 

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:24.650
 He cited so we took a few seconds 

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.030
 we continue heating engines and we return 

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:28.030
 with much more and good but you 

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:40.380
 Hello my name is Guillermo León 

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:43.589
 angel business group 

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.539
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:48.619
 because we are learning python as 

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:50.819
 crazy and I think there's no in the group 

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:52.079
 we are all simply very good at what 

00:40:50.819 --> 00:40:54.869
 what are we doing and joining forces 

00:40:52.079 --> 00:40:57.359
 here to finish fast good a tithe 

00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:59.609
 gomez I am from the group of 7 is very 40% 

00:40:57.359 --> 00:41:02.390
 but we have the certainty that I'm finished 

00:40:59.609 --> 00:41:04.650
 tomorrow and we all have all contributed 

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:08.720
 many important things in the group 

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:11.369
 but I rescue our companion that 

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.140
 he has a lot of knowledge and does not help 

00:41:11.369 --> 00:41:13.589
 contributed too much much more many 

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.240
 Thank you 

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:16.910
 good afternoon no man is July 

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.660
 access only part of the group 

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:22.079
 recyclable 

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:25.500
 we carry an approximate 75 percent 

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:27.870
 of the project and therefore 

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.400
 we consider our genius 

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:31.440
 it has always been our project manager 

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:35.109
 who was he 

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.660
 who originated the idea good my name 

00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:39.120
 is Ricardo Chiriboga from the group of 

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.210
 agronomy 

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:44.340
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:46.170
 size in the group has been between 

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:47.790
 designer and the project manager because 

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:51.600
 they have tried to guide us 

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:54.480
 about the idea my friend didier is 

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:58.230
 commissioning the front end part and 

00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.090
 the backend submit them at 40 per 

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.490
 we are missing is to put the services 

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:04.730
 encouraged in so that front person 

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.730
 in two 

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.790
 and well we still in this nursery but 

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:12.980
 2013 we saw how to develop the back in 

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.810
 groups are still working with you 

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.000
 can see you live a lot of energy 

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:18.740
 technological here in this beautiful 

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.020
 college campus near valera 

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.670
 so thank you very much and we had for 

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:25.460
 close because we had seeing code 

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:27.530
 they also did not comply with the slogan 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.690
 group over eight and had to repeat 

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:32.750
 the reyno dance very good dance very good 

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:34.760
 so measured dance yes it says but it goes 

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.070
 there goes there goes perfect and the 

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:40.070
 moment comes the moment of the second 

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:42.230
 role challenge and now I played and I showed 

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:44.600
 everything here on the court I played soccer 

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.800
 also dance you did not see it but 

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.760
 if not now because we want to see in 

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.800
 guanabacoa 

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.780
 we want to see play for four we want 

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.790
 watch play for which role and but look 

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.290
 we continue because now I'm going to select 

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:56.210
 and I'll surprise you with this golden 

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.190
 only the participants play here 

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:00.230
 but mentors also play at 

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.580
 role and so we continue here I'm going to 

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.720
 come to the middle and I see one of 

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.450
 the mentors that is super there 

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:08.000

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:10.040

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:15.940
 for hair 

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.940
 loud applause plays the role and young 

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.770
 it's better than dancing 

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:29.960

 they are clarifying a little more the 

00:43:43.169 --> 00:43:47.549
 competition every time I think it's more 

00:43:45.239 --> 00:43:49.859
 closed and I think we are already arriving 

00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:51.779
 at the end I think we are already looking at 

00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:54.839
 the finalists that are going to take us 

00:43:51.779 --> 00:43:57.630

 william lion of the group and the business 

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:27.779
 we go more or less to 20% of the back end 

00:51:25.499 --> 00:51:30.559
 because we're learning python like crazy 

00:51:27.779 --> 00:51:32.759
 and I think there's no group 

00:51:30.559 --> 00:51:34.019
 we are all simply very good what 

00:51:32.759 --> 00:51:36.779

 cent but we have the certainty that both 

00:51:41.279 --> 00:51:46.319
 they finish tomorrow and we all have all 

00:51:43.949 --> 00:51:49.529
 contributed many important things in the 

00:51:46.319 --> 00:51:52.829
 group but I rescued our 

00:51:49.529 --> 00:51:54.660
 partner who has a lot of knowledge and 

00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:55.380
 I have not contributed much much more 

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:57.180
 thank you 

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.680
 good afternoon no name is july 

00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:02.779
 I'm an arm member of the group 

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:07.430
 recycle then we take an approximate 

00:52:02.779 --> 00:52:09.800
 75 percent of the project and then 

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:11.329
 we consider our genius 

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.360
 It has always been our own manager 

00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:16.750
 who was he 

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:18.520
 that who originated the idea good my 

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.050
 name is ricardo chiriboga 

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:24.170
 the agronomy group 

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:26.270
 It seems to me that the one who has given the most 

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.130
 size in the group has been between 

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.720
 designer and the project manager because 

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.720
 they have tried to guide us 

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.490
 about the idea my friend 

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:38.120

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:41.570
