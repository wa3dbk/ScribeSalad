00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.050
 well we're back in this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 developers 2013 edition bogotá we are 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.380
 on the day of the back-end we continue 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.870
 developing internal services 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.840
 each of the groups continues 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.600
 very concentrated 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.480
 hating generating a solution how is 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.850
 you cited as among the successes 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.010
 I much much much of careers we have 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.260
 here and of course of course because 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.900
 We are as I told you living in state 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 the technological what each one of the groups 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.699
 they are still concentrated watching details of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.100
 the internal part of the solution that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.050
 they are developing continue to be refined 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.360
 the ideas are still being discussed 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.090
 course the business model and how 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.560
 would work this this new solution with 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.890
 with benefit for the first regional 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.259
 is that in minutes nothing else we will be 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.880
 playing with the groups we are also going to 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.580
 be analyzing as we did in the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.970
 first in our living too 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:26.630
 doing school use cited school 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.240
 the technological test let's say so 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.399
 well also here I already have my side to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.910
 my right of course francisco paco 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.910
 how are you 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 down I think everything is going smoothly 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.340
 some teams look very serious 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.750
 serious very serious really are very 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.640
 serious very concentrated each of the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.310
 team we are going to review is coming 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.530
 also the game of soccer within the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.179
 level or probos 2013 or if they are serious 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.649
 you have to decontract the ones that 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.299
 descontracturar they told us that in 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.030
 colombia good soccer is played 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.460
 let's play soccer with the teams 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.470
 with the participants and the challenge has 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.720
 to see who wins the challenge I do not know 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 if you have the challenge of course you stay 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.400
 without the code revision or it is zafa 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.980
 session 6 of the code review but 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.569
 whoever loses it, whoever loses it, let's 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.630
 check your code in the repository 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.880
 grassi pulse because undertaken live 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.010
 so very interesting for that for that 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.040
 what are we going to see in this live 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.030
 it has to do with computen sin sigue 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.680
 computing without and you will also see something 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.420
 from the tools we also had 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.790
 pending from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.650
 the day of the front on the stage of the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.110
 clown point let's also see something of 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.390
 clown point because they have to see 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.220
 also with the cloud and today is our day 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.569
 of the back-end so important that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.060
 keep in mind that you are there 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.890
 connected that is following no minutes 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.739
 minutes of course of what we're going to 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.380
 talk technically in this live and for 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.660
 of course all the interaction that is lived 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.850
 in this developer bus 2003 edition votes 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.890
 we also remind you that you can get 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.810
 all the information you can see everything 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.850
 what happens in this developer bus 2013 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.110
 in the portal develop point with 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.640
 Google com 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.989
 join the community developers 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.910
 because there is a lot of information too 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.769
 that has to do with minute by minute 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.569
 that has to do with what the teams 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.489
 are doing in interaction 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.340
 community as always we 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.380
 we do here in this video but look and 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.840
 of course from google developers 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.260
 what pacos we already have more than 12,000 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.989
 following people if it is indeed if not 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.450
 you are still in this one the page

 we invite you to go there are photographs of all 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.739
 the equipment is a description of what 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.150
 they are working and it would be great that 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.970
 vote for them 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.280
 the rating is part of what we 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.510
 will take silicon valley with the rest 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.060
 of the winners of the region 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.980
 exactly as Paco says 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.569
 It has to do with that, you can vote for 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.400
 each group can say which 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.349
 it's your favorite that you think you can 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.970
 leave your comments and you can also 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.700
 participate with us live as 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.920
 did you also joel from mexico in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.200
 our first day of the challenge so 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.970
 Sing collaborate and communicate with the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.849
 community so communicate live 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.620
 with us of course so 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.569
 we have a lot of information to tell you 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.819
 we already have our technical framework 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.650
 theoretical framework we are also going to talk about 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.329
 competition and let's talk about those of 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.829
 tools let's do some examples with 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.000
 that we're going to start talking about 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.669
 assumption of the infrastructure as 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.590
 service many social news you can 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.570
 chat with us you can leave your 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.669
 comments you can vote for the groups and 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.599
 help them get to silicon valley 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.460
 also because it's part of the 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.470
 qualification as francisco said 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.120
 seconds ago, you can follow it 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.500
 in the developer community and 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.840
 let's enjoy this video so 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.180
 we heat engines we prepare not you 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.490
 lose soccer football well here in 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.300
 colombia in bogota with the participants 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.970
 all right 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.830
 the technical scenario in seconds so 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.319
 we heat engines and we're back with 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.129
 much more money but bosch 2013 edition 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.129
 Bogota 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.159
 hello good morning my name is michael 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.100
 martin I am from group 7 of our ideas 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.440
 displays the most difficult challenge we had 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.950
 and yesterday on the first day of development 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.290
 was formalize the idea hello I'm jacob and 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:26.380
 sasha this is the team 6 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.480
 business yesterday we had a very bacano challenge 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.230
 that was to create the entire business idea to 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.070
 messing up we feel really good hello my 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.129
 name is leader 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.999
 our group is agronomy 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:41.979
 yesterday we felt good feeling of 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:44.379
 my excellent part therefore working with 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.509
 the group as the group shows that 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.589
 we have a lot of talent to exploit 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:52.599
 and get a quality product and then 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:54.070
 that can really win is the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.610
 competition 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.039
 and so 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.340
 the biggest challenge I say that for us 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:03.050
 can try to define the actual scope 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.409
 of the application that we wanted then to 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.300
 Early in the day we had 10,000 ideas 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.770
 if it touched us 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.470
 polish to leave something more or more 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.780
 achievable for the time that I too 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.800
 I think that after more retouching and these 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.700
 two days left alone 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.550
 give hard to that idea 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.780
 but my name is or more pray I am the uncle 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.090
 of recycling recycle yesterday's did not 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.940
 we feel super good with all the dynamics 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.400
 and our greatest challenge has been to be able 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.030
 integrate the google applications of 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:45.030
 a very very easy way to our 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.810
 integration platform project 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.810
 to recycle 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.880
 we continue in 2013 edition Bogota comes the 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:10.540
 moment of the technical challenge the successes 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.380
 I want you to come with me, sorry, let's go 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.380
 continue to develop 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.870
 csc while we thank the people of 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.510
 the community that is following us 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.220
 Arisbel from Mexico mechas mayerlis 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.710
 I hope I have pronounced your name well 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.420
 from the university of Quindío force 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.450
 to the teams thank you 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.280
 Arming picón already started the t3 bogota 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.470
 everything is in order, in effect we are 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.660
 here live 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.960
 what a barbarian if the defense along 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.960
 all Latin America 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.740
 there's a great one we have to read this 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.990
 hugo garza I think it's almost impossible 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.900
 see the tempus bogota and at the same time 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.950
 the game of portugal and sweden and at the same 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.240
 time to work 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:58.390
 are there priorities please please hugo 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.380
 Bogota for his accompanied by course 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.770
 keep enjoying this 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.260
 developer bus 2013 bogotá bueno let's go to 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.720
 technical challenge that we have I do not know if you 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:10.840
 it seems that we have to analyze in this 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.590
 context has to do with complutense 

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.290
 in itself the infrastructure solution 

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.870
 as a service proposed by google 

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:18.490
 We will quickly show you the console 

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.620
 we have all projects always 

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.380
 we name the same cloud with sun or 

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.480
 page console that was modified to 

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.220
 the cloud console now that we have 

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.370
 we can generate different types of 

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.590
 projects these types of projects by 

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.229
 course they have activations for example 

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:38.380
 I'll show you the first one if 

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:40.750
 we have an overview if where we can 

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.400
 see all the spice activated in this 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.730
 case we have for example close that 

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.830
 store on foot and cloud messaging good 

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.530
 various types of foot and we have by 

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.320
 course activated google compute without 

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.850
 order to make use of the solution 

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.720
 of competition of course at first 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:01.300
 case I have to have it activated on 

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.770
 service then it follows is maintained as 

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.210
 we always talk about it and what 

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.620
 we comment we have the part of 

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.420
 authorization 

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.830
 to service of course if I go to 

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.510
 have to connect what I'm going to have to 

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.720
 do through open authentication or 

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.000
 some of the mechanisms that we have 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.500
 allowed good in this way look 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.660
 I'm going to show you we have several types 

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.640
 of projects in this project that this 

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.900
 project has some of the hype 

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.420
 deactivated 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.280
 let's see but does not have zinc computen 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.930
 to this one also has converts lead to 

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.209
 look for one that does not have activated by 

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:37.910
 example surely you do not have it 

00:09:33.209 --> 00:09:40.259
 all projects have a number of 

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:43.319
 identification and in this way we can 

00:09:40.259 --> 00:09:44.970
 go locating and seeing how to interact 

00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:46.290
 with that service 

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.240
 in this particular case, notice that 

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.360
 we only have close thorax and not 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.740
 we have another of the activated services 

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.350
 what we are going to do for this demo is 

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.759
 go find one of the projects 

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.800
 that you can generate a new 

00:09:56.759 --> 00:10:00.540
 project in this way activate the 

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.670
 service that they require in this case 

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.949
 We are going to activate computer ying 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.929
 to make use of the infrastructure 

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:08.939
 as a service make use of the machines 

00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:11.009
 virtual that google gives us in this 

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:13.980
 case in which I can deploy it what 

00:10:11.009 --> 00:10:16.860
 that comes to mind basically speaking ok 

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.709
 here we have notice that I already have use of 

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.059
 cpu and use of networks since already something of use 

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:23.220
 of disc also from any of the 

00:10:21.059 --> 00:10:25.110
 instances that I have costed here in 

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.240
 as in competition today will enter 

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.800
 compute zinc and you can observe 

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.899
 here I have different machines 

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.540
 virtual team these virtual machines 

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.009
 as you can see here I have one that 

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.179
 flame bogota 

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:37.949
 in this particular case it also has a 

00:10:36.179 --> 00:10:38.700
 disc that is called boot and good has 

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:40.910
 a configuration 

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:44.160
 notice that if I wanted to for example 

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:46.980
 upload and use more instances within 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.900
 this engineering project more machines 

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.300
 virtual and in this way I could continue 

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:53.550
 operating or launch processes or perform 

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.010
 any activity that comes to mind 

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:58.140
 ask for a name sample name if by 

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.060
 example here I have a description for 

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.620
 put I'm generating a machine and 

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.810
 this instance can be like you 

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.820
 are seeing here already or an instance of 

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.850
 one of a mental machine linux in this 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:12.000
 case with well distribution could 

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:15.420
 put metadata tags if you could choose the 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.670
 area where I would like to operate this 

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.680
 because I could choose center zones of 

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.260
 data and specifics depending on what 

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.540
 location have more consumption to achieve 

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:27.690
 better latency or a lower one 

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.850
 latency in this case of development or of 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.950
 use also note that here I 

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:35.130
 I choose the type of machine I would like 

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.540
 use in this case I can use in 

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:40.890
 this case I am using one of a 

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:42.900
 only cpu if with 38 gigabyte of memory 

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.670
 but I could choose something more powerful or 

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.460
 something less powerful 

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.290
 of course discs if I could choose 

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:52.140
 discs and in this way can be 

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.490
 using and what image is it that I 

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.110
 I want to deploy in the virtual machine 

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.640
 some of the images are available 

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.590
 there could be others are also going 

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.150
 permanently updating this 

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:02.400
 way I can keep my machine 

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.950
 updated virtual 

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.870
 note also that you could choose another 

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.150
 of the disks as additional discs 

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.230
 configure my network in this case we are going to 

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.840
 use we can use an ip 

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:18.170
 static also or an ip assigned from 

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:20.839
 good way by the service in tiff 

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.790
 other access parameters that you could 

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:25.070
 configure the virtual machine and already the 

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:27.310
 would leave ready to give you create as 

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:30.370
 I will do at this precise moment 

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:32.080
 this takes a few seconds 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.210
 until the virtual machine rises 

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.190
 is generated and in this way is already 

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.889
 operative we are going to let 

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:42.709
 generating the can see here 

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:45.379
 and we're going to make use of the one we already have 

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:48.259
 configured pre-configured that is the 

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:50.269
 Bogota and how do I access these 

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:51.799
 virtual machines and deploy services 

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:53.299
 and we're going to make the first point that 

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:55.189
 we consider ourselves good I'm going to 

00:12:53.299 --> 00:12:57.829
 use I can do it through ssh 

00:12:55.189 --> 00:13:01.369
 I'm going to use a console if there are 

00:12:57.829 --> 00:13:05.640
 very simple tools that we 

00:13:01.369 --> 00:13:08.209
 also proposes the competition team 

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.300
 I'll show you here in second 

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:13.940
 and that I know that here we have him 

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.050
 the giving is proposing us 

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.760
 basically how to go lifting 

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.380
 instances and in this way go 

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.790
 configuring the headlights I did not show them 

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.230
 but now I'm going to enter the instance or 

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.360
 set a bluff I can change the 

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.339
 network configuration that way to have 

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.870
 my totally chaste machine made it 

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:29.209
 I want to choose your machine 

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.709
 directly exactly then to this 

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:32.450
 machine I can deploy is a linux 

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:34.640
 so I can explain the service 

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:36.620
 who wants and I can perform the operation 

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.779
 who wants that is the fundamental point 

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.860
 of this one now we're going to use this one 

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:45.350
 these tools if it is useful and 

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:48.230
 if they want to see it that way and if it's useful and this 

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:50.060
 way with command language in a 

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.860
 console basically a chat I can 

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.959
 connect me like I'm going to do this good 

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.510
 notice that here we have a step by step and 

00:13:53.959 --> 00:13:58.430
 where he configures the project and I go 

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:01.250
 accessing in different ways I have 

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.649
 a previous configuration of keys 

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.120
 let's say to be able to authorize myself and that the 

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:07.630
 service recognize me in this way 

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.860
 to be able to continue working 

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.990
 quickly here 

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.920
 to consolidate I will use the 

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.920
 tools that I mentioned 

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.210
 let's hot that is used in this case 

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.310
 I'm going to tell you that I'm going to 

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.260
 connect me by ssh and we will tell you 

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.180
 that I'm going to connect to the machine 

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.399
 Bogota 

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:30.140
 in this case I am entering 

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:32.450
 through the cch as you can see and 

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.910
 at this precise moment I am already inside 

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.370
 of the virtual machine xi so I'm 

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:40.100
 operating in seconds it generates a 

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.779
 instance is distance I have it ready is 

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.209
 a virtual machine and that way already 

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:46.520
 I have my server on the internet and I can 

00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:49.209
 unfold an apache if I wanted to I can already 

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:52.700
 put it to work and I will place my 

00:14:49.209 --> 00:14:54.770
 html on my website what I would like 

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.560
 in this way fully operational ok 

00:14:54.770 --> 00:15:01.030
 good as you can see I'm going to 

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.960
 navigate inside this server 

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.460
 look 

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.430
 Ron 

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.710
 to this in the home I will make a list 

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:12.530
 of this yes as I have here to patch 

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.300
 installed in this case yes but I already 

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.190
 I show of course in second I'm going to 

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.930
 show how they install themselves very quickly 

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.480
 a being a patched patch service 

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.850
 this case I will go to one of the 

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:26.010
 directories that I have that is the bar 

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:28.710
 where they are publishing 

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:31.950
 the sites here I can go to double-double 

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:35.130
 yes and notice that I am enrolling here 

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:37.620
 I already have an index html is the service or 

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:40.560
 be the html by default the index that 

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:43.440
 raise the apache service the idea is 

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:46.410
 that we see that html index and that we can 

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.090
 detect as it is already is 

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.770
 working if the machine is already 

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.840
 virtual the apache is already installed and 

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.340
 I can quickly access the service 

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:58.190
 through the public ip truth 

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.190
 then let's quickly see this yes 

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:03.420
 and we return to our console notice that 

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.540
 I have my virtual machine here we go to 

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.540
 enter 

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:12.899
 the virtual machine of bogota 

00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:15.329
 here I have look at internal ips of 

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:18.959
 I manage and I have a static ip so 

00:16:15.329 --> 00:16:22.819
 I put it external which is 8.35 point 192 

00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:25.009
 point 133 let's go point be here 

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:26.749
 and here the first thing we see when 

00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:28.100
 we enter saying that it is unique and public 

00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:29.509
 of course he is raising the 

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.989
 my virtual machine's apache service 

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:33.949
 that I just generated seconds ago 

00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:36.049
 prior to the one I showed you 

00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:37.999
 I already have the hello war but the idea is 

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:39.919
 that we can we are inside the machine 

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:41.419
 virtual that we can modify that html 

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:43.669
 which is very simple and that way 

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:45.589
 change hello or hello world by the 

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:48.889
 hello world or hello bogota so 

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:51.319
 whether we go there I need under the pac 

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:52.910
 can be also take hello paco what 

00:16:51.319 --> 00:16:54.799
 let's try to put the pac 

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:58.729
 well then I'm in here 

00:16:54.799 --> 00:17:00.199
 now notice that you could how could in 

00:16:58.729 --> 00:17:02.600
 first moment of editing would be inside me 

00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:05.029
 linux what options do I have to edit 

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.220
 shtml that I could use I'm in 

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:09.730
 a devia 

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:14.799
 no longer 

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:18.220
 nano index.hu ml ok 

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:20.140
 there I am seeing already my html that is says 

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.299
 hello world so what could I do 

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:26.290
 is to come and change and say hello paqui 

00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:28.330
 true an army works 

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:32.910
 then there I have the opaque good let's go 

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.910
 to write this yes and what happened 

00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:36.830
 step that I do not have write permissions 

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.480
 How could I give my virtual machine 

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.249
 write permissions that is the question 

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.629
 that we have to do in 

00:17:40.249 --> 00:17:44.059
 this particular case as we could 

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:47.509
 do you quoted what you think it does 

00:17:44.059 --> 00:17:49.730
 I do not know, I say, I ask everyone to 

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:52.389
 diego 2013 that could be I'm inside 

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:55.190
 I linux what option I have to be able 

00:17:52.389 --> 00:17:58.399
 operate with this I would say if you know that 

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:01.190
 for them to do it to see who is 

00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:03.200
 encourages me to do it for myself or someone 

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.700
 of the talents of colombia is encouraged to 

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.169
 doing it for me is a line what there is 

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.669
 to modify just I know there's a lot 

00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:10.100
 people working with complutense 

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:11.600
 we raise a virtual machine to that 

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.769
 virtual machine was installed the 

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.629
 service that we will now do in 

00:18:12.769 --> 00:18:16.759
 seconds next to voice of the new machine 

00:18:14.629 --> 00:18:19.429
 virtual and then the only thing we did is 

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:21.169
 navigate to the place where you publish the 

00:18:19.429 --> 00:18:24.409
 apache and in this way modify a 

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:26.629
 simple super simple html note what 

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:28.940
 fast for ccoo can innovate people 

00:18:26.629 --> 00:18:30.499
 your virtual machine can be generated can 

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.480
 put the number of processors of 

00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:34.059
 memory that wants good of those that there 

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.009
 available a Linux distribution 

00:18:34.059 --> 00:18:40.210
 fully flexible deploys a 

00:18:37.009 --> 00:18:45.980
 application and I already have it operational 

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:49.789
 lift up the brave hot hand do 

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:52.789
 this earns a kit so that they are not a 

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:54.590
 kit let's go with the paco kit what happened 

00:18:52.789 --> 00:19:00.259
 so 

00:18:54.590 --> 00:19:02.269
 he is a courageous mentor that they raise had 

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:04.639
 that being a mentor does not work 

00:19:02.269 --> 00:19:05.960
 is cheating bogotá they are 

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:08.649
 cheating what I did 

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.299
 make him a sweat nothing else either I put 

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:13.249
 obviously as admin so it's simple you 

00:19:11.299 --> 00:19:15.470
 I told nano what is the file what and 

00:19:13.249 --> 00:19:18.019
 is and notice what happened Mr. 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:19.850
 I knew it and I know that you knew I was 

00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:22.070
 sure they knew it but they do not cheer up and 

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:25.009
 they lost just right this a 

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.809
 trip to california exam what a pity 

00:19:25.009 --> 00:19:28.759
 but well, it's very much you who are 

00:19:26.809 --> 00:19:30.830
 there of course concentrated because it 

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:32.389
 had concentrated watching competing without 

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.429
 quickly good now we show you 

00:19:32.389 --> 00:19:38.150
 write these three lines I said hello 

00:19:34.429 --> 00:19:40.880
 paco be good once 

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.400
 we already wrote this then we're going to 

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.020
 get out of here I keep on the console what 

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.500
 what would have to happen is that 

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.000
 when I changed if I refresh 

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.640
 appeared the changed box appeared on 

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.200
 blackout and appeared the peace that I am good 

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.450
 because if you look and the blackout did not appear 

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.570
 then very simple very simple 

00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.890
 We show how to use this console 

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.030
 how to use competition to 

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.280
 get up a new virtual machine 

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.600
 now look at the quick start yes that 

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.240
 we have of course the step to 

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.500
 step where we go to you auto 

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.940
 authorizing to use another of the 

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.890
 virtual machines imagine that 

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.440
 we want to authorize another of the 

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:19.870
 machines and what are we going to do then I 

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.870
 I'm going to use another one with solita 

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.780
 here we have 

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:28.020
 let's see again the utilities for 

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.550
 course we are going to enter by ssh and we are going 

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:33.230
 to look for us to generate a 

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:33.230
 new a new instance 

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:39.510
 in computing and we had generated a 

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:43.500
 that is called true example that has 

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:46.370
 flu good then let's go back to 

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.440
 our example 

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.110
 in this way try to connect us by 

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.000
 ssh to that second instance of which 

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.320
 we were talking good here 

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.660
 we are connected to the second instance 

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.190
 and I promised them we were going for 

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.740
 course to try to install good 

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.390
 notice that it could generate a firewall 

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.000
 could perform different types of 

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:08.090
 configurations but the idea by 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.960
 course is to install apache notice I'll 

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:15.070
 to use again a sudo 

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:17.080
 let's see ok and there we are installing 

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.460
 Apache are first making a law of 

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.850
 the packages and now we're going to install the 

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.190
 apache 20 

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:24.770
 so it's simple to notice that I in three 

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.020
 clicks in four clicks with the console 

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:29.870
 I'm installing and leaving configured 

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.620
 if the new virtual machine there is what 

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:35.929
 we make it that simple 

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.570
 and we are when that process ends 

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:40.970
 I have apache 20 running I'm going again 

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.400
 to browse the system file edit 

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.770
 what what is necessary and this 

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.240
 way forward the process of 

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.429
 innovation that we are seeing that a 

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.289
 Sometimes yes, I want to generate a 

00:21:49.429 --> 00:21:53.210
 solution I want it to be scalable I want 

00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:55.940
 that has infrastructure that gives me 

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.500
 support so simple very fast with 

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.840
 compete zinc I register the service 

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.809
 and I really have everything available for 

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.880
 How did you see that great or what is 

00:22:02.809 --> 00:22:07.520
 Extremely easy to do things since they saw it 

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.860
 and they can also combine perfect all 

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:12.830
 the cloud computing in app platform 

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.780
 engine etc. then 

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.429
 and then there are games a little more complex 

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:18.470
 how to tell or what is there from computen 

00:22:16.429 --> 00:22:20.270
 without going to consume pain without from app 

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.460
 in without I can delegate things in 

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.419
 competition we are going to see also in the 

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.220
 tomorrow we are going to be 

00:22:23.419 --> 00:22:25.610
 integrating let's see prediction but 

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.260
 we go 

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:30.440
 close and what is the scenario of 

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.820
 relational as if it were the same let's say 

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.340
 in the cloud then this way I 

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:36.110
 I can also interact between 

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.730
 relational repositories go to data 

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.100
 store does not necessarily relate 

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.380
 equal and use the infrastructure of 

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.450
 cloud and use it the solution of 

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.760
 platform that is what we 

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:48.710
 we call the cloud platform that is 

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.570
 delivering google and that really is very 

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.820
 useful and it's very good that you know him 

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.520
 if we present compete singh yes 

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:57.559
 we accomplish success very quickly how 

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.330
 unite you know you're there connected 

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:01.190
 Of course you can converse with 

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.049
 we could there be any question the 

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.510
 You can do so that the answer is sent 

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:07.720
 for its access by its buses and I'm 

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:10.040
 speaking of that, look there's 

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:14.260
 requests for the camera hidden in 

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:17.929
 two teams ask us to cooperate followed 

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.549
 recícme ok ok let's go if the spy camera 

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:22.220
 is out there is the spy camera 

00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:23.630
 prepared so we're going to take some 

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.030
 seconds we will continue heating 

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:28.460
 engines will come football with the 

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:30.800
 participants so attentive is coming 

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.630
 code review we will continue 

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.130
 sharing with you of course all 

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.200
 google technology all the 

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.940
 cloud technology on the day of 

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.160
 back-end so for ccoo we 

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.350
 we prepare if we heat engines and 

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.870
 we are back in seconds with much more 

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:47.290
 unveiled but bosch 2013 edition little such 

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.290
 we'll be back 

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:59.470
 It was a great experience when a lot 

00:23:55.539 --> 00:24:01.179
 people we made the groups was a challenge 

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:03.460
 present at the end of the day everything 

00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:06.249
 we had progressed and thus present them 

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.860
 in front of so many people on YouTube 

00:24:06.249 --> 00:24:11.320
 it was a little bit scary 

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.759
 true but then there we go and then we go 

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.299
 to make the group winner the number 

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:15.789
 four 

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:18.249
 thank you good yesterday was very 

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:20.799
 interesting because there were quite a lot of challenges 

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:22.809
 first of all, how to model the 

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:24.399
 idea that we had the skills of 

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:26.499
 each of the group members for 

00:24:24.399 --> 00:24:30.700
 what could we do fast 

00:24:26.499 --> 00:24:33.070
 simple and how it works then was a 

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.049
 interesting experience because you can 

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.629
 get to see how it's always like 

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:39.909
 positive any change and see how the 

00:24:37.629 --> 00:24:42.759
 the skills of each person 

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:44.769
 we feel well happy 

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:46.149
 we are a little bit tired two a 

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:48.580
 little in sleep but it does not matter 

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:50.570
 today it is right to give it and I think tomorrow 

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.820
 if we are going to be 

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.440
 Hi, I'm Mario Moreno and I'm from the team 

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.990
 Claudio 

00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.240
 yesterday I felt very good with a lot 

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:03.400
 energy is the team gave everything 

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.860
 of fish one ear all I had to 

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.490
 do in his role I dedicated myself to design 

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.160
 the brand 

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:13.429
 in the application that we are going to do and the 

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:16.730
 challenge was to take that presentation in less 

00:25:13.429 --> 00:25:18.140
 half an hour and to have it ready and we 

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:21.260

 I feel we are confident and we are going 

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:23.530

 yesterday it really was a great experience 

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:49.400
 I met a lot of people we made groups 

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:51.740
 it was a challenge to present at the end of the day 

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.530
 everything that we had progressed and then 

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:57.260

00:25:54.530 --> 00:26:01.480
 youtube well it was a bit gives a bit of 

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.480
 fear the truth but was saved 

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.140

 all islanders technology all the 

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:56.120
 implementation framework of the backend if 

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.610
 the internal services but I need 

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.160
 we have surprises for the imprisoned doctor 

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:02.510

 with me and with good paco let's review 

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.400
 the code and they're going to lose all 

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:12.470
 you football are very good we are going to 

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:16.390

 We were talking about Roche 

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:32.330
 requests about the spy camera is 

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.340
 the spy camera out there is the camera 

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.940
 you can spy on the groups we're going to

 we are seeing the groups you see a 

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.890
 notebook 

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.890

 We were spying on the groups but 

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:03.560
 it seems that they realized 

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:05.300
 and they keep walking not of those good ones is 

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.560

 where we are having a good time is 

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.370

 of course here in Bogota so for 

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.920

 much more than what is happening with 

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:33.380

 between those and also to keep if 

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:51.320
 you want your web repository 

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.880
 the code repository scenario 

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.830
 open source or whatever you want if 

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.960
 also virtual machines of course 

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.460
 yes, so we are also 

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.600

 you know there are teams that 

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.109
 we were wondering you saw the cuts 

00:29:43.559 --> 00:29:49.799
 how they were motivated and everyone did 

00:29:46.109 --> 00:29:51.389
 with food they watched he ate very well 

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:53.070
 we're going to ask 

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:54.450
 the groups to you what interests you 

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:56.429

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.320
 what is that about we also have very 

00:29:56.429 --> 00:30:00.299
 concentrated to the people there writing

 the group stated that they can well 

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:37.700

 while I'm putting the bow here and we're going 

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:44.299
 to compete of course for the review 

00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:46.190
 of code so I kept looking at me I put together 

00:30:44.299 --> 00:30:51.200
 the arch that we already have here we are going to 

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:53.379
 play are chosen pre-elected ok sax 

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.899
 who will come to compete with us 

00:30:53.379 --> 00:30:59.600
 here we have the arc already armed you like 

00:30:56.899 --> 00:31:01.669
 little voice look that of course 

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.340
 nicb shortcut in playing is small

 bow no of course no no no no I 

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:10.190
 run the bow the bow is running me 

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:13.000
 no no of course so it's the 

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:16.760
 We are ready now 

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.960
 be prepared come to one of you who is going 

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.510
 to come to play soccer with 

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.570
 we go very well perfect already 

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:31.840
 we have almost everything armed so for 

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:34.929
 course they have good 13 and also 

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:38.480
 also good is going to play carolina 

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:40.280

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.770
 good follow us let's play with them 3 

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.230
 we project the one that I can not get a 

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:48.020
 goal will get me the review of 

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.600
 code so it's super simple simple 

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.299
 we'll see 

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.760
 the little one is going to kick with this one because 

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:56.740
 it's logical if you make room for me there 

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:58.630
 I'm going to come follow me around here 

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.820
 We are going to be 

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:03.070
 Carefully, we broke nothing 

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.500
 supposedly good I would not try it up 

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:08.050
 because even what is appetite let's see if 

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.340
 keep that can be the review this 

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:11.500
 can happen anything new that 

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.000
 is there of course you can vote it 

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.580
 comes the goal or does not come speak 

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.370
 something will come carolina iván and the lord and 

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:24.070
 guillermo william good review 

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:26.490
 of the code so you can kick 

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.490
 quiet 

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:33.110
 review I say here, so for ccoo 

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:36.620
 what do you think about argentina view 1 colombia 

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:38.240
 0 good we go very calm they come 

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.429
 for here sir you are going to kick with 

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.370
 is because it is the biggest, that is, 

00:32:40.429 --> 00:32:44.660
 course yes you live out there to see 

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:46.759
 what do you think Guillermo is going to kick 

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:50.229
 we go 

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:54.589
 how I feel is already looking for the 

00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:59.289
 experienced so do not worry what 

00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:59.289
 I will do everything 

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:07.700
 an applause for the second good 

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:12.190
 the three revisions of Argentine code 

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:12.190
 two colombias but good to see what happens 

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:24.490
 this is very simple of a problem 

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.120
 low low good we win then as 

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.370
 you will see if this was the most honest 

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.440
 possible if your image of the challenge and you 

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.920
 come three code reviews for 

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:46.280
 what did you think about it, I think someone 

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.870
 can enter but I hope you think we're looking 

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.190
 we look for a 1 more 

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.320
 one more group it seems to you that you're 

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.690
 there who wants to score goal and save himself 

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.100
 the coaching review we already follow 

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:57.110
 spying on the camera we already follow 

00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.590
 spying on the camera and there they are sending 

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:02.840
 nobody is and neither are they for me 

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.520
 I'm scared with that camera and really 

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:06.200
 it's very interesting but you can 

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.120
 vote also to see 

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.950
 You want me to kick who you want to 

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.860
 you who follow the camera is selecting 

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.700
 people is also really very 

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.480
 interesting 

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.480
 30 

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.700
 we're going to do something 

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:26.179
 come forward colombia 

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:32.830
 let's do it will be easier andrea is going to 

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:37.490
 have to do little games and if he succeeds 

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:40.470
 do three little games together if 3 

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:44.550
 from the floor he lifts 

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:45.899
 very easy and with the knee is 

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:49.290
 cheating but hey if he manages to be 

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:53.300
 four four in a row tac tac tac tac 

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.300
 if the code revision is saved 

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:01.950
 well almost almost very well andrea too 

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.680
 the revision of codes with the last 

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:08.609
 paco the last one looked for the ball yes to see 

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:10.770
 if someone because we finish 40 for now 

00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:13.740
 yes it reminds me of old times 

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:15.030
 let's say the camera follows 

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:24.980
 selecting in the camera is 

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:24.980
 selecting the applause 

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:33.700
 well you're going to have to do 25 25 with 5 

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:37.030
 is fine with 5 is well behind no 

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.470
 break nothing is not known if the little game 

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.680
 down 

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:45.450
 already go 4 to 0 juan manuel the lift and 

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:48.869
 makes little games tac tac 1 2 3 4 5 

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:51.170
 it's all source code like bénabar 2 3 4 

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:51.170
 5 

00:35:55.410 --> 00:36:04.599
 pity did not reach the 25 or 95 also 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:07.089
 code review for him so 50 50 

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:08.950
 3 - good green let's take some 

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:10.960
 seconds we rest from this 

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:13.960
 training 

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.809
 I'm a bit agitated and we're back with 

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.980
 Code reviews with much more 

00:36:15.809 --> 00:36:22.230
 technical scenario and let's review with 

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.230
 the group so a few seconds we continue 

00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:42.589
 hello good morning my name is michael 

00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:45.200
 martínez I am from group 7 of our 

00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:46.760
 ideas best place the hardest challenge that 

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.040
 we had 

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:52.190
 in yesterday on the first day of development 

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:55.070
 was to formalize the idea or the reija 

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:57.980
 blankets this is team 6 and the 

00:36:55.070 --> 00:37:00.050
 business yesterday we had a very bacano challenge 

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:02.690
 that was to create the entire business idea to 

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:05.270
 messing up we feel really good 

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:07.660
 hello my name is didier our group 

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:11.710
 it is agronomy 

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:13.690
 yesterday we felt good about myself 

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:16.390
 excellent part because working with the 

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:18.609
 group as the group shows that we have 

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:22.450
 a lot of talent to exploit and take out 

00:37:18.609 --> 00:37:25.670
 a product of quality and therefore that can 

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:27.200
 to really win is the competition 

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.599
 and so 

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.109
 the biggest challenge I say that for us 

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:34.640
 was to try to define the actual scope of 

00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:38.000
 the application that we wanted then to 

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.880
 Early in the day we had 10,000 ideas 

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.380
 and it touched us 

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:47.079
 polish to leave something more or more 

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:49.119
 achievable for the time that I have 

00:37:47.079 --> 00:37:52.400
 I think that after the biggest challenge and because 

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:55.320
 these two days left alone 

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:58.140
 give hard to that idea 

00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:02.370
 but my name is or more pray I am the uncle 

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:04.530
 of recycling recycle yesterday's did not 

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:07.530
 we feel super good with all the dynamics 

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:10.020
 and our greatest challenge has been to be able 

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:13.650
 integrate the google applications of 

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:16.620
 a very very easy way to our 

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:19.490
 integration platform project 

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.490
 of recycling 

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.920
 very good we're still in this saying what 

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:49.590
 he proved 2013 how we really have fun 

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.420
 we were playing with the groups with the 

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:53.040
 football players here good 

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.380
 he really was as honest as possible 

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.480
 we really gave him the possibility of not 

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:00.210
 check the code but unfortunately 

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:02.970
 the team freed but bush won paco 

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:05.790
 and good to 0 5 to 0 I know it was a landslide 

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:07.590
 categorical here what we live so 

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.100
 well possibly tomorrow we continue with 

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.750
 this 

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.520
 for what messages do we have in 

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:14.070
 our social network because I think that already 

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.170
 there are controversial messages there 

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.060
 game that we had will perform patrick 

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:20.070
 from Argentina accuses you of cheating 

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:27.360
 I'm not sure because I do not think 

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:31.940
 they understood the rules but of course yes 

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:34.020
 of course we have some message there 

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:37.410
 many words in Spanish that do not 

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:40.170
 we understand how rudy toxo that good 

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:42.150
 let's also ask then and what not 

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.279
 late 

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:45.900
 to see what happens with that in the meantime 

00:39:44.279 --> 00:39:47.880
 his successes following while paco continues 

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.460
 processing the messages its how much 

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.529
 we were presenting competing without how 

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.089
 lift or how to use it as 

00:39:52.529 --> 00:39:55.799
 they lifted a virtual machine how 

00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:57.539
 use the cloud infrastructure what 

00:39:55.799 --> 00:39:59.700
 we made it very simple we generated a 

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:01.950
 new instance in that distance 

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.660
 we install services those services by 

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:06.140
 of course in this case use apache that the 

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:09.809
 web server to justly 

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.609
 visualize good websites then in 

00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:14.579
 this particular case we edit one of the 

00:40:11.609 --> 00:40:16.470
 pages and quickly we could have with 

00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:18.480
 a public ip the solution of what 

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.220
 we had to go back to the 

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.680
 console if while following the camera 

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:26.390
 spy and there 

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:26.390
 I'm scared about the spy camera 

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.400
 as I had already asked and of course 

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.349
 apart with this spy camera we 

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.400
 we are seeing how they are performing and 

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:37.589
 each of the groups so it's very 

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:40.680
 interesting there the code also we 

00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:43.230
 they are undressing if the cameras 

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:45.420
 all there but of course nothing happens 

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.770
 because this is pure adrenaline with 

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.000
 we the same with groups and 

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.920
 groups are 

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.480
 being very good as I said 

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.920
 then we have our console that 

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.480
 console that I showed you here 

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.130
 we raise the virtual machine to which 

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.140
 we installed apache what I'm going to do 

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:00.180
 Now as simple as that, imagine that 

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.970
 I'm using it more by reuters 

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:05.970
 if I wanted to or directly as I said 

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:08.370
 I'm going to erase it, so that's how it's simple 

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:09.360
 with a very very very easy console 

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.220
 I can lift 'virtual machines 

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.610
 install services and perform the 

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.500
 operation you want if it's a linux if a 

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:18.030
 my disposition in this particular case 

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.100
 so that's the first point that 

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:21.960
 we had and the other concept that 

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.000
 we always speak are those of tools and 

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.260
 who allow you to do everything because 

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.650
 really when it's not developing 

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:30.630
 websites it is very important to edit and 

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.370
 see the styles work with the 

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.530
 application performance we have 

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:36.630
 many utilities of the depto but 

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:38.400
 I'm going to show good some of the 

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:42.000
 little things for example to manipulate the 

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:44.859
 style here we have a very website 

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.380
 simple we have an integration with maps 

00:41:44.859 --> 00:41:50.529
 we are using maps api version 3 

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.359
 very simple but what I wanted them 

00:41:50.529 --> 00:41:54.220
 show is how to use them in pools 

00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:56.349
 good to them I'm opening the console 

00:41:54.220 --> 00:42:00.789
 is showing me the html 

00:41:56.349 --> 00:42:02.829
 we are seeing your successes true yes ok and 

00:42:00.789 --> 00:42:05.529
 in this context, notice that I can go 

00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:08.190
 selecting as I said I have 

00:42:05.529 --> 00:42:10.470
 all the elements if I had 

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:13.140
 to work them resources 

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.160
 Persistence resources not disconnected 

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.560
 for example good could quickly 

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:18.420
 visualize them here could come and see 

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:21.060
 how is it working in local stores 

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.280
 thorax the elector so decision that many 

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:26.369
 Sometimes it is really important to have it 

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.319
 well in mind and analyze it yes so 

00:42:26.369 --> 00:42:30.810
 could come to visualize here also 

00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:32.310
 as I said network performance 

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:35.940
 when I'm doing gestures 

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:37.619
 post how they are performing and good to go 

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:40.800
 analyzing the performance of my site in 

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:42.750
 general without seeing I also have to 

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.819
 access the shorts and if I have 

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:47.040
 javascript as I told you I made a 

00:42:44.819 --> 00:42:49.530
 very simple integration and notice that there 

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.380
 You can see it I'm looking at the site 

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:54.359
 web this is funded yes but very 

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.810
 quickly the tools allow me 

00:42:54.359 --> 00:42:59.250
 good to identify for example where 

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.560
 I'm taking that image that I'm 

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:03.630
 placing inside the next track 

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.160
 we want to change it if we can change what 

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.950
 you can change here without any problem 

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.619
 of course we have to have a one 

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:11.540
 url of an icon of an image and what 

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:15.050
 we can do 

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:16.670
 is also awaiting versions and of the 

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.680
 code like I'm going to edit it and that 

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.410
 way it allows me to very quickly operate 

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.150
 If I can also work with profile or 

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:25.160
 is to see much more performance and how 

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:27.320
 is working javascript and so 

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:29.420
 successively audit and work with the 

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.390
 console in general as for example already 

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:35.360
 we have there is an alert ok 

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:38.390
 well the point here is if I want 

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.710
 change parts of the styles of 

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.720
 styles of this page 

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:44.090
 well very quickly could come and 

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:50.600
 detect for example here and say look 

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:54.710
 well this is 400 high has 500 

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.570
 of current width I labeling the styles 

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:58.090
 my site is quickly changing 

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.410
 then I could see how it is going 

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:03.170
 playing each one of them and 

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:06.900
 depending on what you play now 

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:09.839
 I would like to change the background 

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.339
 What would I have to do as I would change? 

00:44:09.839 --> 00:44:13.079
 this style if I want to change the 

00:44:11.339 --> 00:44:15.240
 bar background for that someone from here 

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:18.000
 you have to know of course we are 

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:20.069
 talking about basic html abans and 

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.190
 elementary so to you who are 

00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:26.039
 connected there yes yes tell me that I have 

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:27.660
 what do I do from the tools here 

00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:30.220
 as I'm doing step has a 

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:33.609
 second trip to california 

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:35.680
 you never know or know the prize is 

00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:37.270
 says after he answers the sacred 

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.160
 here we are about the regional talent 

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:41.020
 so the question is what would have to 

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.119
 do in this case using the 

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.849
 sales very easily to work 

00:44:43.119 --> 00:44:49.650
 about the body of this very basic html 

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:49.650
 to change the background color 

00:44:52.830 --> 00:45:01.740
 let's call the man who said 

00:44:55.480 --> 00:45:01.740
 perfect says I watched him applause 

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.540
 come come come come come with me I followed 

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.940
 taught here is going to be very 

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:11.160
 interesting has two opportunities to 

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.380
 change the code so there you have it 

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:17.490
 free if this is seeing it I 

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:20.369
 I control here and of course if I 

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:21.840
 he does well he saves himself from the code I know 

00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:23.730
 it can bother him also like in the 

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.390
 soccer so you do not have any 

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.390
 problem is writing 

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.950
 and he managed to imagine that we want it 

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.540
 we want to do so I want a scale of 

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:39.330
 colors and immense and I want a scale 

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.700

00:45:49.800 --> 00:46:10.860
 do I keep looking at the 10 9 8 7 7 6 5 4 3 

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:14.450

 yesterday it was very interesting because there was 

00:48:57.279 --> 00:49:01.900
 quite challenges first of all was how 

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:03.489
 model the idea that we had at 

00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:04.520
 skills of each member 

00:49:03.489 --> 00:49:06.800
 of group for what 

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:10.520
 so we could do it fast simple and 

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:12.890
 how they work then was a 

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.870
 interesting experience because you can 

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:17.450
 get to see how it's always like 

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:20.570
 positive any change and see how the 

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:22.610
 the skills of each person how we 

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:24.560
 we feel well happy 

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:25.970
 we are a little bit tired two a 

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.400
 little in sleep but it does not matter 

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:31.550

 many energies the team gave everything 

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.779
 the fish I see everything I had to 

00:49:43.319 --> 00:49:47.400
 do in his role I dedicated myself to design 

00:49:45.779 --> 00:49:50.069
 the brand 

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:53.339
 the application that we are going to do and the 

00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:56.640
 challenge was to take that presentation in less 

00:49:53.339 --> 00:49:57.930
 half an hour and to have it ready and we 

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.170
 it was very well I think it went very well 

00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:03.440
 it's true we feel confident and we're going 

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:03.440

 yesterday it really was a great experience 

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:29.329
 I met a lot of people we made groups 

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:31.640
 it was a challenge to present at the end of the day 

00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:34.460
 everything that we had progressed and then 

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:37.190
 present it in front of so many people in 

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:39.380
 youtube well it was a bit gives a bit of 

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.700
 fear the truth but then there goes very 

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.400
 well we're still in this nursery 

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:45.020
 approved 2013 Bogota edition really 

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.640

 how to use the cloud infrastructure 

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.270
 of google using competition and by 

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.279
 course we also saw some flashes 

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:53.839
 of the tulle we were making a 

00:50:52.279 --> 00:50:55.940
 virtual machine we had configuring the 

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:59.330
 apache we have playing soccer with the 

00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:03.770

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:07.370
 around here while I'm already paco 

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:10.670

 it was so I had 

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.090
 5 to 2 in the fumes 

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:13.260
 well then we decide 

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:16.640
 work our application on php in the 

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.640
 normal server 

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:29.490
 tell the truth and then I have to 

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:31.530
 php server we are working 

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:34.770
 normal consultations that is to be able to 

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:37.260
 use sql cloud but then now in 

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:40.200
 the cloud sql needed payment and right now 

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:44.520
 they collaborated with us with the bonus for 

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:47.520
 to be able to pass the sdk and deploy our 

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.350
 perfect app app engine ok 

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.210
 although I know that they are going to use as 

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:53.310
 persistence klaus and what yes clear 

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:56.100
 although we already have voice successes not 

00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:59.100
 we have neither nor was it necessary to use it to 

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:01.110
 July here I was praying because I did not 

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:03.030
 ask for nothing of course very 

00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:05.250
 safe and the criminal wants to play a penalty 

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:06.720

 we have it right here on the back that 

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.520
 is going to say something 

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:20.329
 say something specific 

00:55:18.799 --> 00:55:23.480

00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:27.670

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.640
 was measuring the times for the 

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.950
 video 

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.360
 we have a video presentation where 

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:49.880
 we put all projects between the idea 

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.280
 it was that they supported me little with time 

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.010

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:24.390

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:45.109

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:45.109
