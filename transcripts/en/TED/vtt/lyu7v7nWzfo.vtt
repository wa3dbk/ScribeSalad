00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.160
Just over a year ago,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.216
for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.520
I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.856
I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.080
and a coldness.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.296
And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.760
but definitely there.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.096
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.376
you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.136
but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.376
of a continuity between then and now.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.616
Coming round from
anesthesia is very different.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.136
I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.576
five years or even 50 years.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.056
I simply wasn't there.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.320
It was total oblivion.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.296
Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.496
It turns people into objects,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.520
and then, we hope, back again into people.

00:00:59.544 --> 00:01:00.776
And in this process

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.040
is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.016
How does consciousness happen?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.256
Somehow, within each of our brains,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.176
the combined activity
of many billions of neurons,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.216
each one a tiny biological machine,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.056
is generating a conscious experience.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.016
And not just any conscious experience --

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.421
your conscious experience
right here and right now.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:21.645
How does this happen?

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.616
Answering this question is so important

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.496
because consciousness
for each of us is all there is.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.520
Without it there's no world,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.776
there's no self,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.336
there's nothing at all.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.313
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously

00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:37.417
whether it's through
mental illness or pain.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.336
And if we can experience
joy and suffering,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.800
what about other animals?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.736
Might they be conscious, too?

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.416
Do they also have a sense of self?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.576
And as computers get faster and smarter,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.176
maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.936
when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.440
I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.336
And I think this because
my research is telling me

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.016
that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.616
and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.336
Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.920
You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.896
In the story I'm going to tell you,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.256
our conscious experiences
of the world around us,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.616
and of ourselves within it,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.176
are kinds of controlled hallucinations

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.176
Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.936
about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.096
Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.336
But in fact,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.496
the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.296
If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.480
you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.120
and sometimes even philosophers.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.776
All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.520
and what happens when it goes wrong.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.016
And the strategy is very simple.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.016
I'd like you to think about consciousness

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.256
in the way that we've
come to think about life.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.896
At one time, people thought
the property of being alive

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.536
could not be explained
by physics and chemistry --

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.720
that life had to be
more than just mechanism.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.376
But people no longer think that.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.016
As biologists got on with the job

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.616
of explaining the properties
of living systems

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.456
in terms of physics and chemistry --

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.536
things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis --

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.376
the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.456
and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.480
like a force of life or an élan vital.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.736
So as with life, so with consciousness.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.056
Once we start explaining its properties

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.776
in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.216
the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.976
should start to fade away.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.720
At least that's the plan.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.536
So let's get started.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.536
What are the properties of consciousness?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.084
What should a science
of consciousness try to explain?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.656
Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.056
There are experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.296
full of sights, sounds and smells,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.240
there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.560
And then there's conscious self.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.536
The specific experience
of being you or being me.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.576
The lead character in this inner movie,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.960
and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.296
Let's start with experiences
of the world around us,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.055
and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.839
Imagine being a brain.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.255
You're locked inside a bony skull,

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.496
trying to figure
what's out there in the world.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.536
There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.336
All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.536
which are only indirectly related
to things in the world,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.760
whatever they may be.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.656
So perception --
figuring out what's there --

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.536
has to be a process of informed guesswork

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.696
in which the brain combines
these sensory signals

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.776
with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.936
to form its best guess
of what caused those signals.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.656
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.040
What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.960
Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.376
You might have seen this illusion before,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.656
but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.736
If you look at those two patches, A and B,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.080
they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.016
But they are in fact
exactly the same shade.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.376
And I can illustrate this.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.616
If I put up a second version
of the image here

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.656
and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.336
you can see there's no difference.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.136
It's exactly the same shade of gray.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.816
And if you still don't believe me,

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080
I'll bring the bar across
and join them up.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.040
It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.456
This isn't any kind of magic trick.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.896
It's the same shade of gray,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.120
but take it away again,
and it looks different.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.496
So what's happening here

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.336
is that the brain
is using its prior expectations

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.456
built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.176
that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.840
so that we see B as lighter
than it really is.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.176
Here's one more example,

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.376
which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.696
to change what we consciously experience.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.920
Have a listen to this.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.480
(Distorted voice)

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.896
Sounded strange, right?

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.349
Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.720
(Distorted voice)

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.136
Still strange.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.360
Now listen to this.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.976
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.336
(Laughter)

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.576
Which I do.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.416
So you heard some words there, right?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.536
Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.616
(Distorted voice)

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.136
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.360
Once more for luck.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.040
(Distorted voice)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.256
OK, so what's going on here?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.856
The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.080
hasn't changed at all.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.216
All that's changed
is your brain's best guess

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.296
of the causes of that sensory information.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.680
And that changes
what you consciously hear.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.696
All this puts the brain
basis of perception

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.176
in a bit of a different light.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.216
Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.776
from the outside world,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.296
it depends as much, if not more,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.240
on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.216
We don't just passively
perceive the world,

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.936
we actively generate it.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.576
The world we experience
comes as much, if not more,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.936
from the inside out

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.280
as from the outside in.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.816
Let me give you
one more example of perception

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.720
as this active, constructive process.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.536
Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.536
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.896
on experience.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.816
In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world --

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.736
which is in this case Sussex campus --

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.320
into a psychedelic playground.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.616
We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.736
to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.376
In this case, to see dogs.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.536
And you can see
this is a very strange thing.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.656
When perceptual
predictions are too strong,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.056
as they are here,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.976
the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.016
people might report in altered states,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.120
or perhaps even in psychosis.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.787
Now, think about this for a minute.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.256
If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.736
then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.776
but a controlled hallucination

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.696
in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.600
by sensory information from the world.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.176
In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.576
including right now.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.416
It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.640
we call that reality.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.216
(Laughter)

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.576
Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.416
the specific experience of being you,

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.936
is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.976
This seems a very strange idea, right?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.136
Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.680
but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.416
For most of us,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.016
the experience of being a person

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.136
is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.376
that it's difficult
not to take it for granted.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.216
But we shouldn't take it for granted.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.456
There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.576
There's the experience of having a body

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.056
and of being a body.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.216
There are experiences
of perceiving the world

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.880
from a first person point of view.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.456
There are experiences
of intending to do things

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.200
and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.896
And there are experiences

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.816
of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.680
built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.496
Many experiments show,

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.856
and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.776
that these different ways
in which we experience being a self

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.496
can all come apart.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.416
What this means is
the basic background experience

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.016
of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.696
Another experience,
which just like all others,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.920
requires explanation.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.496
So let's return to the bodily self.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.256
How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.536
and of having a body?

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.416
Well, just the same principles apply.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.896
The brain makes its best guess

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.120
about what is and what is not
part of its body.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.616
And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.616
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.136
this is one you can do at home.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.056
All you need is one of these.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.336
(Laughter)

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.800
And a couple of paintbrushes.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.256
In the rubber hand illusion,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.256
a person's real hand is hidden from view,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.896
and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.176
Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.880
while the person stares at the fake hand.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.296
Now, for most people, after a while,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.416
this leads to the very uncanny sensation

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.040
that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.816
And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.216
on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.016
is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.256
that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.880
(Laughter)

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.496
So you can measure
all kinds of clever things.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.816
You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.096
but there's no need.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.056
It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.496
This means that even experiences
of what our body is

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.056
is a kind of best guessing --

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.560
a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.680
There's one more thing.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.776
We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.536
we also experience them from within.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.800
We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.576
And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.656
are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.336
how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.576
lots of things.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.080
This kind of perception,
which we call interoception,

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.096
is rather overlooked.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.536
But it's critically important

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.896
because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body --

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.520
well, that's what keeps us alive.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.816
Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.336
This is from our lab at Sussex.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.776
And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.176
which flashes red and back

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.456
either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.936
And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.080
people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.216
So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.640
in perceiving our bodies from within.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.336
There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.016
which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.096
from experiences of the world around us.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.816
When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects --

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.016
tables, chairs, rubber hands,

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.776
people, you lot --

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.776
even my own body in the world,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.056
I can perceive it
as an object from the outside.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.136
But my experiences
of the body from within,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.576
they're not like that at all.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.656
I don't perceive my kidneys here,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.256
my liver here,

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.536
my spleen ...

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.456
I don't know where my spleen is,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.856
but it's somewhere.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.776
I don't perceive my insides as objects.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.440
In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.880
And this is important, I think.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.696
Perception of the internal
state of the body

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.576
isn't about figuring out what's there,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.736
it's about control and regulation --

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.656
keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.520
that are compatible with survival.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.496
When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there,

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.616
we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.256
When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.440
we experience how well
or how badly that control is going.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.696
So our most basic experiences
of being a self,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.776
of being an embodied organism,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.760
are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.096
And when we follow this idea
all the way through,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.816
we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences,

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.576
since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.016
all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.656
We experience the world and ourselves

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.760
with, through and because of
our living bodies.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.960
Let me bring things together step-by-step.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.136
What we consciously see depends

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.456
on the brain's best guess
of what's out there.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.856
Our experienced world
comes from the inside out,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.120
not just the outside in.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.856
The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.720
of what is and what is not our body.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.136
And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.920
coming from deep inside the body.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.616
And finally,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.016
experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.720
than figuring out what's there.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.056
So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it --

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.336
well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.256
that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.040
to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.160
We predict ourselves into existence.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.000
Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.856
First, just as we can
misperceive the world,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.656
we can misperceive ourselves

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.816
when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.056
Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.696
because we can finally
get at the mechanisms

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.616
rather than just treating the symptoms

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.160
in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.936
Second:

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.776
what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.176
a software program running on a robot,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.416
however smart or sophisticated.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.056
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.336
whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.336
by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.000
Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.296
Finally,

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.296
our own individual inner universe,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.976
our way of being conscious,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.760
is just one possible
way of being conscious.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.816
And even human consciousness generally --

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.816
it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.496
Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.736
but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.360
shared with many other living creatures.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.880
Now, these are fundamental changes

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.016
in how we understand ourselves,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.896
but I think they should be celebrated,

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.296
because as so often in science,
from Copernicus --

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.320
we're not at the center of the universe --

00:16:22.344 --> 00:16:23.576
to Darwin --

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.816
we're related to all other creatures --

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.040
to the present day.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.056
With a greater sense of understanding

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.496
comes a greater sense of wonder,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.376
and a greater realization

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.000
that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.120
And ...

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.096
when the end of consciousness comes,

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.920
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.760
Nothing at all.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.696
Thank you.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:59.746
(Applause)
