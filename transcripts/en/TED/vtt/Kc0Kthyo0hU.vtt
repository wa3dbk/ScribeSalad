00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:17.216
What is it that French people
do better than all the others?

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:20.380
If you would take polls,

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.211
the top three answers might be:

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:26.274
love, wine and whining.

00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:27.599
(Laughter)

00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:28.782
Maybe.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.868
But let me suggest a fourth one:

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.082
mathematics.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.613
Did you know that Paris
has more mathematicians

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.438
than any other city in the world?

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:41.295
And more streets
with mathematicians' names, too.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.664
And if you look at the statistics
of the Fields Medal,

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:48.181
often called the Nobel Prize
for mathematics,

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:52.137
and always awarded to mathematicians
below the age of 40,

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:56.048
you will find that France has more
Fields medalists per inhabitant

00:00:56.072 --> 00:00:57.240
than any other country.

00:00:58.286 --> 00:01:01.240
What is it that we find so sexy in math?

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:05.357
After all, it seems to be
dull and abstract,

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:08.864
just numbers and computations
and rules to apply.

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:12.630
Mathematics may be abstract,

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:13.805
but it's not dull

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.558
and it's not about computing.

00:01:16.178 --> 00:01:17.925
It is about reasoning

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:20.209
and proving our core activity.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.035
It is about imagination,

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:24.078
the talent which we most praise.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:26.203
It is about finding the truth.

00:01:27.613 --> 00:01:30.350
There's nothing like the feeling
which invades you

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:32.545
when after months of hard thinking,

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.867
you finally understand the right
reasoning to solve your problem.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.618
The great mathematician
André Weil likened this --

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:41.793
no kidding --

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:43.406
to sexual pleasure.

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:49.538
But noted that this feeling
can last for hours, or even days.

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.657
The reward may be big.

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:57.189
Hidden mathematical truths
permeate our whole physical world.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.350
They are inaccessible to our senses

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:03.098
but can be seen
through mathematical lenses.

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:05.684
Close your eyes for moment

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:09.183
and think of what is occurring
right now around you.

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:13.830
Invisible particles from the air
around are bumping on you

00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:16.587
by the billions and billions
at each second,

00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.674
all in complete chaos.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.200
And still,

00:02:20.224 --> 00:02:24.912
their statistics can be accurately
predicted by mathematical physics.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.507
And open your eyes now

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.841
to the statistics of the velocities
of these particles.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,

00:02:35.774 --> 00:02:37.955
or the Law of Errors --

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.701
of deviations with respect
to the mean behavior.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.852
This curve tells about the statistics
of velocities of particles

00:02:45.876 --> 00:02:48.415
in the same way as a demographic curve

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.280
would tell about the statistics
of ages of individuals.

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:55.534
It's one of the most
important curves ever.

00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:59.323
It keeps on occurring again and again,

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:01.750
from many theories and many experiments,

00:03:01.774 --> 00:03:05.055
as a great example of the universality

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.631
which is so dear to us mathematicians.

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:10.921
Of this curve,

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:13.994
the famous scientist Francis Galton said,

00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:18.542
"It would have been deified by the Greeks
if they had known it.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:22.415
It is the supreme law of unreason."

00:03:23.818 --> 00:03:30.420
And there's no better way to materialize
that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:34.971
Inside this board are narrow tunnels

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:39.623
through which tiny balls
will fall down randomly,

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:45.682
going right or left, or left, etc.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.390
All in complete randomness and chaos.

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:56.165
Let's see what happens when we look
at all these random trajectories together.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.624
(Board shaking)

00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:04.492
This is a bit of a sport,

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:09.386
because we need to resolve
some traffic jams in there.

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:12.865
Aha.

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:16.900
We think that randomness
is going to play me a trick on stage.

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.072
There it is.

00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:24.965
Our supreme goddess of unreason.

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:26.508
the Gauss Curve,

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:32.984
trapped here inside this transparent box
as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.

00:04:34.623 --> 00:04:37.321
For you I have shown it,

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:42.630
but to my students I explain why
it could not be any other curve.

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:45.998
And this is touching
the mystery of that goddess,

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:50.723
replacing a beautiful coincidence
by a beautiful explanation.

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:53.360
All of science is like this.

00:04:54.213 --> 00:04:59.561
And beautiful mathematical explanations
are not only for our pleasure.

00:04:59.585 --> 00:05:02.245
They also change our vision of the world.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.277
For instance,

00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.451
Einstein,

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:06.626
Perrin,

00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:07.801
Smoluchowski,

00:05:07.826 --> 00:05:11.385
they used the mathematical analysis
of random trajectories

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.446
and the Gauss Curve

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.398
to explain and prove that our
world is made of atoms.

00:05:19.524 --> 00:05:21.326
It was not the first time

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.740
that mathematics was revolutionizing
our view of the world.

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:27.767
More than 2,000 years ago,

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.401
at the time of the ancient Greeks,

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:32.981
it already occurred.

00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:35.113
In those days,

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:38.420
only a small fraction of the world
had been explored,

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:41.486
and the Earth might have seemed infinite.

00:05:42.034 --> 00:05:43.801
But clever Eratosthenes,

00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:45.242
using mathematics,

00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:50.377
was able to measure the Earth
with an amazing accuracy of two percent.

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.385
Here's another example.

00:05:54.238 --> 00:05:58.043
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:04.979
that a pendulum swings slightly
slower in Cayenne than in Paris.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.750
From this observation alone,
and clever mathematics,

00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:13.080
Newton rightly deduced

00:06:13.104 --> 00:06:18.645
that the Earth is a wee bit
flattened at the poles,

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:20.270
like 0.3 percent --

00:06:20.843 --> 00:06:25.256
so tiny that you wouldn't even
notice it on the real view of the Earth.

00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:30.204
These stories show that mathematics

00:06:30.228 --> 00:06:34.990
is able to make us go out of our intuition

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:38.997
measure the Earth which seems infinite,

00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.315
see atoms which are invisible

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:44.720
or detect an imperceptible
variation of shape.

00:06:44.744 --> 00:06:48.591
And if there is just one thing that you
should take home from this talk,

00:06:48.615 --> 00:06:49.809
it is this:

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:54.211
mathematics allows us
to go beyond the intuition

00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:58.484
and explore territories
which do not fit within our grasp.

00:06:59.609 --> 00:07:02.608
Here's a modern example
you will all relate to:

00:07:03.362 --> 00:07:05.029
searching the Internet.

00:07:06.037 --> 00:07:07.379
The World Wide Web,

00:07:07.403 --> 00:07:09.207
more than one billion web pages --

00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:10.905
do you want to go through them all?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.462
Computing power helps,

00:07:13.486 --> 00:07:16.672
but it would be useless without
the mathematical modeling

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:19.259
to find the information
hidden in the data.

00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:22.870
Let's work out a baby problem.

00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:27.679
Imagine that you're a detective
working on a crime case,

00:07:27.703 --> 00:07:31.491
and there are many people
who have their version of the facts.

00:07:32.032 --> 00:07:33.777
Who do you want to interview first?

00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:36.596
Sensible answer:

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.057
prime witnesses.

00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:40.112
You see,

00:07:40.136 --> 00:07:44.356
suppose that there is person number seven,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.531
tells you a story,

00:07:45.555 --> 00:07:47.569
but when you ask where he got if from,

00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:50.629
he points to person
number three as a source.

00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:52.721
And maybe person number three, in turn,

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:56.441
points at person number one
as the primary source.

00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:58.126
Now number one is a prime witness,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.388
so I definitely want
to interview him -- priority.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.299
And from the graph

00:08:03.323 --> 00:08:06.551
we also see that person
number four is a prime witness.

00:08:06.575 --> 00:08:09.018
And maybe I even want
to interview him first,

00:08:09.042 --> 00:08:11.401
because there are more
people who refer to him.

00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:15.018
OK, that was easy,

00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:20.288
but now what about if you have
a big bunch of people who will testify?

00:08:20.864 --> 00:08:22.216
And this graph,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.859
I may think of it as all people
who testify in a complicated crime case,

00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:31.905
but it may just as well be web pages
pointing to each other,

00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:34.000
referring to each other for contents.

00:08:34.878 --> 00:08:37.214
Which ones are the most authoritative?

00:08:37.587 --> 00:08:38.921
Not so clear.

00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:41.991
Enter PageRank,

00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:44.551
one of the early cornerstones of Google.

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:49.579
This algorithm uses the laws
of mathematical randomness

00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:53.460
to determine automatically
the most relevant web pages,

00:08:53.484 --> 00:08:58.546
in the same way as we used randomness
in the Galton Board experiment.

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:01.682
So let's send into this graph

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:04.556
a bunch of tiny, digital marbles

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.329
and let them go randomly
through the graph.

00:09:08.353 --> 00:09:10.020
Each time they arrive at some site,

00:09:10.044 --> 00:09:14.210
they will go out through some link
chosen at random to the next one.

00:09:14.234 --> 00:09:15.987
And again, and again, and again.

00:09:16.358 --> 00:09:17.986
And with small, growing piles,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.763
we'll keep the record of how many
times each site has been visited

00:09:21.787 --> 00:09:23.732
by these digital marbles.

00:09:24.243 --> 00:09:25.394
Here we go.

00:09:25.418 --> 00:09:27.266
Randomness, randomness.

00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:29.259
And from time to time,

00:09:29.283 --> 00:09:33.235
also let's make jumps completely
randomly to increase the fun.

00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:35.687
And look at this:

00:09:36.358 --> 00:09:39.143
from the chaos will emerge the solution.

00:09:39.483 --> 00:09:41.968
The highest piles
correspond to those sites

00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:45.503
which somehow are better
connected than the others,

00:09:45.527 --> 00:09:47.800
more pointed at than the others.

00:09:47.824 --> 00:09:49.546
And here we see clearly

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.602
which are the web pages
we want to first try.

00:09:53.507 --> 00:09:54.658
Once again,

00:09:54.682 --> 00:09:57.142
the solution emerges from the randomness.

00:09:57.775 --> 00:10:00.026
Of course, since that time,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.757
Google has come up with much more
sophisticated algorithms,

00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:06.061
but already this was beautiful.

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.457
And still,

00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:10.092
just one problem in a million.

00:10:10.734 --> 00:10:13.004
With the advent of digital area,

00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:18.044
more and more problems lend
themselves to mathematical analysis,

00:10:18.068 --> 00:10:22.433
making the job of mathematician
a more and more useful one,

00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:25.888
to the extent that a few years ago,

00:10:25.912 --> 00:10:29.691
it was ranked number one
among hundreds of jobs

00:10:29.715 --> 00:10:33.683
in a study about the best and worst jobs

00:10:33.707 --> 00:10:36.682
published by the Wall Street
Journal in 2009.

00:10:37.445 --> 00:10:39.297
Mathematician --

00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:40.754
best job in the world.

00:10:41.646 --> 00:10:44.714
That's because of the applications:

00:10:44.738 --> 00:10:46.877
communication theory,

00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:48.721
information theory,

00:10:48.745 --> 00:10:50.005
game theory,

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:51.475
compressed sensing,

00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:53.061
machine learning,

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:54.652
graph analysis,

00:10:54.676 --> 00:10:56.418
harmonic analysis.

00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:59.082
And why not stochastic processes,

00:10:59.106 --> 00:11:00.736
linear programming,

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.788
or fluid simulation?

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:07.187
Each of these fields have
monster industrial applications.

00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:08.362
And through them,

00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:10.385
there is big money in mathematics.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.440
And let me concede

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:15.941
that when it comes to making
money from the math,

00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:19.789
the Americans are by a long shot
the world champions,

00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:24.432
with clever, emblematic billionaires
and amazing, giant companies,

00:11:24.456 --> 00:11:27.736
all resting, ultimately,
on good algorithm.

00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:33.063
Now with all this beauty,
usefulness and wealth,

00:11:33.087 --> 00:11:35.371
mathematics does look more sexy.

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.016
But don't you think

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.160
that the life a mathematical
researcher is an easy one.

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:45.700
It is filled with perplexity,

00:11:46.347 --> 00:11:47.497
frustration,

00:11:48.172 --> 00:11:50.617
a desperate fight for understanding.

00:11:51.955 --> 00:11:54.095
Let me evoke for you

00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:58.499
one of the most striking days
in my mathematician's life.

00:11:58.523 --> 00:11:59.674
Or should I say,

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:01.435
one of the most striking nights.

00:12:02.713 --> 00:12:03.864
At that time,

00:12:03.888 --> 00:12:07.039
I was staying at the Institute
for Advanced Studies in Princeton --

00:12:07.063 --> 00:12:09.202
for many years, the home
of Albert Einstein

00:12:09.226 --> 00:12:13.654
and arguably the most holy place
for mathematical research in the world.

00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:18.722
And that night I was working
and working on an elusive proof,

00:12:18.746 --> 00:12:20.124
which was incomplete.

00:12:21.304 --> 00:12:23.512
It was all about understanding

00:12:23.536 --> 00:12:27.359
the paradoxical stability
property of plasmas,

00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:29.341
which are a crowd of electrons.

00:12:30.423 --> 00:12:33.159
In the perfect world of plasma,

00:12:33.183 --> 00:12:34.961
there are no collisions

00:12:34.985 --> 00:12:38.643
and no friction to provide
the stability like we are used to.

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:40.543
But still,

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:43.600
if you slightly perturb
a plasma equilibrium,

00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:46.312
you will find that the
resulting electric field

00:12:46.336 --> 00:12:48.675
spontaneously vanishes,

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:50.674
or damps out,

00:12:50.698 --> 00:12:53.992
as if by some mysterious friction force.

00:12:54.728 --> 00:12:56.563
This paradoxical effect,

00:12:56.587 --> 00:12:58.064
called the Landau damping,

00:12:58.088 --> 00:13:01.077
is one of the most important
in plasma physics,

00:13:01.101 --> 00:13:04.103
and it was discovered
through mathematical ideas.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.121
But still,

00:13:06.145 --> 00:13:10.375
a full mathematical understanding
of this phenomenon was missing.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:15.185
And together with my former student
and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,

00:13:15.209 --> 00:13:16.701
in Paris at the time,

00:13:16.725 --> 00:13:20.811
we had been working for months
and months on such a proof.

00:13:21.832 --> 00:13:23.167
Actually,

00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:27.937
I had already announced by mistake
that we could solve it.

00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:29.686
But the truth is,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.857
the proof was just not working.

00:13:32.196 --> 00:13:36.545
In spite of more than 100 pages
of complicated, mathematical arguments,

00:13:36.569 --> 00:13:38.259
and a bunch discoveries,

00:13:38.283 --> 00:13:39.550
and huge calculation,

00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:40.743
it was not working.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:42.971
And that night in Princeton,

00:13:42.995 --> 00:13:47.296
a certain gap in the chain of arguments
was driving me crazy.

00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:52.251
I was putting in there all my energy
and experience and tricks,

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:54.017
and still nothing was working.

00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:58.435
1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,

00:13:58.459 --> 00:13:59.767
not working.

00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:04.866
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:08.375
Then a few hours later,

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:09.550
waking up and go,

00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:12.931
"Ah, it's time to get
the kids to school --"

00:14:12.955 --> 00:14:14.106
What is this?

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.272
There was this voice in my head, I swear.

00:14:16.894 --> 00:14:18.807
"Take the second term to the other side,

00:14:18.831 --> 00:14:20.750
Fourier transform and invert in L2."

00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:22.408
(Laughter)

00:14:22.432 --> 00:14:24.134
Damn it,

00:14:24.158 --> 00:14:26.271
that was the start of the solution!

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.670
You see,

00:14:28.694 --> 00:14:30.977
I thought I had taken some rest,

00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:34.389
but really my brain had
continued to work on it.

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:36.605
In those moments,

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:39.230
you don't think of your career
or your colleagues,

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.944
it's just a complete battle
between the problem and you.

00:14:44.098 --> 00:14:45.426
That being said,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.399
it does not harm when you do get
a promotion in reward for your hard work.

00:14:49.808 --> 00:14:54.968
And after we completed our huge
analysis of the Landau damping,

00:14:54.992 --> 00:14:56.607
I was lucky enough

00:14:56.631 --> 00:14:59.661
to get the most coveted Fields Medal

00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:02.552
from the hands of the President of India,

00:15:02.576 --> 00:15:06.496
in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --

00:15:07.453 --> 00:15:10.704
an honor that mathematicians
never dare to dream,

00:15:10.728 --> 00:15:13.127
a day that I will remember until I live.

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:15.813
What do you think,

00:15:15.837 --> 00:15:17.978
on such an occasion?

00:15:18.002 --> 00:15:19.152
Pride, yes?

00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:23.431
And gratitude to the many collaborators
who made this possible.

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:26.516
And because it was a collective adventure,

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.682
you need to share it,
not just with your collaborators.

00:15:31.548 --> 00:15:37.240
I believe that everybody can appreciate
the thrill of mathematical research,

00:15:37.264 --> 00:15:41.582
and share the passionate stories
of humans and ideas behind it.

00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:47.268
And I've been working with my staff
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:15:47.292 --> 00:15:52.473
together with partners and artists
of mathematical communication worldwide,

00:15:52.497 --> 00:15:57.084
so that we can found our own,
very special museum of mathematics there.

00:15:58.537 --> 00:16:00.314
So in a few years,

00:16:00.885 --> 00:16:02.462
when you come to Paris,

00:16:02.486 --> 00:16:08.144
after tasting the great, crispy
baguette and macaroon,

00:16:08.168 --> 00:16:11.831
please come and visit us
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:16:11.856 --> 00:16:14.371
and share the mathematical dream with us.

00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:15.546
Thank you.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:22.570
(Applause)
