00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:15.125
This is a man-made forest.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.097
It can spread over acres
and acres of area,

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.613
or it could fit in a small space --

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:25.125
as small as your house garden.

00:00:27.327 --> 00:00:30.546
Age of this forest
is just two years old.

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:34.413
I have a forest in the backyard
of my own house.

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:36.985
It attracts a lot of biodiversity.

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:41.558
(Bird call)

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:43.774
I wake up to this every morning,

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:45.297
like a Disney princess.

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:46.718
(Laughter)

00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:48.370
I am an entrepreneur

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.774
who facilitates the making
of these forests professionally.

00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:54.722
We have helped factories,

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:55.903
farms,

00:00:55.927 --> 00:00:57.085
schools,

00:00:58.287 --> 00:00:59.442
homes,

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:01.482
resorts,

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:03.629
apartment buildings,

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.131
public parks

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:08.197
and even a zoo

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:09.730
to have one of such forests.

00:01:10.715 --> 00:01:15.009
A forest is not an isolated piece of land
where animals live together.

00:01:16.035 --> 00:01:21.575
A forest can be an integral part
of our urban existence.

00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:23.546
A forest, for me,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.067
is a place so dense with trees
that you just can't walk into it.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.037
It doesn't matter
how big or small they are.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:34.429
Most of the world
we live in today was forest.

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.486
This was before human intervention.

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:39.153
Then we built up our cities
on those forests,

00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:40.677
like São Paulo,

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:43.470
forgetting that we belong
to nature as well,

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:47.244
as much as 8.4 million
other species on the planet.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:51.643
Our habitat stopped being
our natural habitat.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.192
But not anymore for some of us.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:58.242
A few others and I today make
these forests professionally --

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.073
anywhere and everywhere.

00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:03.234
I'm an industrial engineer.

00:02:03.258 --> 00:02:05.430
I specialize in making cars.

00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:08.254
In my previous job at Toyota,

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:12.346
I learned how to convert
natural resources into products.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.307
To give you an example,

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:16.982
we would drip the sap
out of a rubber tree,

00:02:17.006 --> 00:02:18.665
convert it into raw rubber

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.394
and make a tire out of it -- the product.

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:24.412
But these products can never
become a natural resource again.

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:28.245
We separate the elements from nature

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.505
and convert them
into an irreversible state.

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:33.246
That's industrial production.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.487
Nature, on the other hand,
works in a totally opposite way.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.895
The natural system produces
by bringing elements together,

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.274
atom by atom.

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:49.051
All the natural products
become a natural resource again.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:53.285
This is something which I learned

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.347
when I made a forest
in the backyard of my own house.

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:59.647
And this was the first time
I worked with nature,

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:01.137
rather than against it.

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.070
Since then,

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:08.143
we have made 75 such forests
in 25 cities across the world.

00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:11.800
Every time we work at a new place,

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:16.568
we find that every single element
needed to make a forest

00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:18.642
is available right around us.

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:21.347
All we have to do is to bring
these elements together

00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.332
and let nature take over.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.101
To make a forest we start with soil.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.565
We touch, feel and even taste it

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.057
to identify what properties it lacks.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.722
If the soil is made up of small particles
it becomes compact --

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:39.149
so compact, that water cannot seep in.

00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:44.636
We mix some local biomass
available around,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.187
which can help soil become more porous.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.016
Water can now seep in.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.858
If the soil doesn't have
the capacity to hold water,

00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:57.557
we will mix some more biomass --

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.855
some water-absorbent material
like peat or bagasse,

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.727
so soil can hold this water
and it stays moist.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.298
To grow, plants need water,
sunlight and nutrition.

00:04:11.047 --> 00:04:13.783
What if the soil doesn't have
any nutrition in it?

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:16.709
We don't just add nutrition
directly to the soil.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.345
That would be the industrial way.

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:19.795
It goes against nature.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.903
We instead add microorganisms to the soil.

00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:26.236
They produce the nutrients
in the soil naturally.

00:04:26.886 --> 00:04:29.475
They feed on the biomass
we have mixed in the soil,

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.198
so all they have to do
is eat and multiply.

00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:34.173
And as their number grows,

00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:35.745
the soil starts breathing again.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.162
It becomes alive.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.842
We survey the native
tree species of the place.

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:42.947
How do we decide what's native or not?

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:47.931
Well, whatever existed
before human intervention is native.

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:49.344
That's the simple rule.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.794
We survey a national park

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.024
to find the last remains
of a natural forest.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.690
We survey the sacred groves,

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:04.605
or sacred forests around old temples.

00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:07.252
And if we don't find anything at all,

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:08.800
we go to museums

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:14.047
to see the seeds or wood of trees
existing there a long time ago.

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:20.044
We research old paintings,
poems and literature from the place,

00:05:20.068 --> 00:05:22.601
to identify the tree species
belonging there.

00:05:23.217 --> 00:05:24.563
Once we know our trees,

00:05:24.587 --> 00:05:26.505
we divide them in four different layers:

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.936
shrub layer, sub-tree layer,
tree layer and canopy layer.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:32.992
We fix the ratios of each layer,

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:37.720
and then we decide the percentage
of each tree species in the mix.

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:40.339
If we are making a fruit forest,

00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:43.422
we increase the percentage
of fruit-bearing trees.

00:05:43.446 --> 00:05:45.612
It could be a flowering forest,

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:49.572
a forest that attracts
a lot of birds or bees,

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:54.085
or it could simply be a native,
wild evergreen forest.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.529
We collect the seeds
and germinate saplings out of them.

00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:01.975
We make sure that trees
belonging to the same layer

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:03.849
are not planted next to each other,

00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:07.200
or they will fight for the same
vertical space when they grow tall.

00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:09.784
We plant the saplings close to each other.

00:06:10.548 --> 00:06:13.613
On the surface, we spread
a thick layer of mulch,

00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:16.205
so when it's hot outside
the soil stays moist.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:18.317
When it's cold,

00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:21.558
frost formation happens only on the mulch,

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:24.991
so soil can still breathe
while it's freezing outside.

00:06:25.497 --> 00:06:28.666
The soil is very soft --

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.184
so soft, that roots
can penetrate into it easily,

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:33.358
rapidly.

00:06:34.064 --> 00:06:36.549
Initially, the forest doesn't
seem like it's growing,

00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:38.391
but it's growing under the surface.

00:06:38.746 --> 00:06:40.207
In the first three months,

00:06:40.231 --> 00:06:42.158
roots reach a depth of one meter.

00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.620
These roots form a mesh,

00:06:44.644 --> 00:06:46.373
tightly holding the soil.

00:06:46.397 --> 00:06:49.993
Microbes and fungi live
throughout this network of roots.

00:06:50.706 --> 00:06:54.293
So if some nutrition is not available
in the vicinity of a tree,

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:57.177
these microbes are going to get
the nutrition to the tree.

00:06:57.754 --> 00:06:59.478
Whenever it rains,

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:00.662
magically,

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.549
mushrooms appear overnight.

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:05.778
And this means the soil below
has a healthy fungal network.

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:08.930
Once these roots are established,

00:07:08.954 --> 00:07:11.119
forest starts growing on the surface.

00:07:11.835 --> 00:07:16.202
As the forest grows we keep watering it --

00:07:16.226 --> 00:07:20.017
for the next two to three years,
we water the forest.

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:25.808
We want to keep all the water
and soil nutrition only for our trees,

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:28.516
so we remove the weeds
growing on the ground.

00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.289
As this forest grows,
it blocks the sunlight.

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.247
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense

00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.505
that sunlight can't reach
the ground anymore.

00:07:37.902 --> 00:07:41.364
Weeds cannot grow now,
because they need sunlight as well.

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:43.323
At this stage,

00:07:43.347 --> 00:07:46.544
every single drop of water
that falls into the forest

00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:48.925
doesn't evaporate back
into the atmosphere.

00:07:49.327 --> 00:07:52.415
This dense forest condenses the moist air

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.210
and retains its moisture.

00:07:54.712 --> 00:07:58.865
We gradually reduce and eventually
stop watering the forest.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.858
And even without watering,

00:08:00.882 --> 00:08:04.928
the forest floor stays moist
and sometimes even dark.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.370
Now, when a single leaf
falls on this forest floor,

00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:11.545
it immediately starts decaying.

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:15.503
This decayed biomass forms humus,

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:17.029
which is food for the forest.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.209
As the forest grows,

00:08:19.233 --> 00:08:20.903
more leaves fall on the surface --

00:08:20.927 --> 00:08:22.959
it means more humus is produced,

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:26.221
it means more food so the forest
can grow still bigger.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:28.978
And this forest keeps
growing exponentially.

00:08:30.053 --> 00:08:31.469
Once established,

00:08:31.493 --> 00:08:35.683
these forests are going to regenerate
themselves again and again --

00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:37.281
probably forever.

00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:40.655
In a natural forest like this,

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.350
no management is the best management.

00:08:44.493 --> 00:08:46.284
It's a tiny jungle party.

00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.523
(Laughter)

00:08:48.663 --> 00:08:51.206
This forest grows as a collective.

00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:52.945
If the same trees --

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:54.246
same species --

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.508
would have been planted independently,

00:08:56.532 --> 00:08:58.479
it wouldn't grow so fast.

00:08:58.503 --> 00:09:02.687
And this is how we create
a 100-year-old forest

00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:04.020
in just 10 years.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.198
Thank you very much.

00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:10.796
(Applause)
