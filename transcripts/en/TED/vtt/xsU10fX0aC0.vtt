00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.016
For the past few years,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.369
I've been spending my summers
in the marine biological laboratory

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.383
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:25.093
And there, what I've been doing
is essentially renting a boat.

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.717
What I would like to do is ask you

00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:29.971
to come on a boat ride with me tonight.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:36.729
So, we ride off from Eel Pond
into Vineyard Sound,

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:39.264
right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:42.625
equipped with a drone
to identify potential spots

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.126
from which to peer into the Atlantic.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.429
Earlier, I was going to say
into the depths of the Atlantic,

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:51.632
but we don't have to go too deep
to reach the unknown.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.882
Here, barely two miles away

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:59.452
from what is arguably the greatest
marine biology lab in the world,

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.697
we lower a simple
plankton net into the water

00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.542
and bring up to the surface

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.966
things that humanity rarely
pays any attention to,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.522
and oftentimes has never seen before.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.204
Here's one of the organisms
that we caught in our net.

00:01:14.228 --> 00:01:15.487
This is a jellyfish.

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:17.193
But look closely,

00:01:17.217 --> 00:01:20.208
and living inside of this animal
is another organism

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:22.937
that is very likely
entirely new to science.

00:01:22.961 --> 00:01:24.639
A complete new species.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:27.820
Or how about this other transparent beauty

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:29.384
with a beating heart,

00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:32.836
asexually growing on top of its head,

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.046
progeny that will move on
to reproduce sexually.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.034
Let me say that again:

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:41.744
this animal is growing asexually
on top of its head,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:46.255
progeny that is going to reproduce
sexually in the next generation.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.278
A weird jellyfish?

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:50.106
Not quite.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.412
This is an ascidian.

00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:53.056
This is a group of animals

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.827
that now we know we share
extensive genomic ancestry with,

00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:01.574
and it is perhaps the closest
invertebrate species to our own.

00:02:02.376 --> 00:02:03.745
Meet your cousin,

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:05.199
Thalia democratica.

00:02:05.223 --> 00:02:07.181
(Laughter)

00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:11.195
I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot
at your last family reunion

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:12.651
for Thalia,

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.327
but let me tell you,

00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:17.679
these animals are profoundly related to us

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.735
in ways that we're just
beginning to understand.

00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:26.289
So, next time you hear anybody
derisively telling you

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:30.210
that this type of research
is a simple fishing expedition,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:33.234
I hope that you'll remember
the trip that we just took.

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.515
Today, many of the biological
sciences only see value

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.088
in studying deeper what we already know --

00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:42.622
in mapping already-discovered continents.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.437
But some of us are much more
interested in the unknown.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.793
We want to discover
completely new continents,

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:54.218
and gaze at magnificent
vistas of ignorance.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.770
We crave the experience
of being completely baffled

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:00.968
by something we've never seen before.

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:02.262
And yes, I agree

00:03:02.286 --> 00:03:06.086
there's a lot of little ego satisfaction
in being able to say,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.585
"Hey, I was the first one
to discover that."

00:03:09.102 --> 00:03:12.007
But this is not
a self-aggrandizing enterprise,

00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:14.731
because in this type
of discovery research,

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:18.373
if you don't feel like a complete
idiot most of the time,

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:20.678
you're just not sciencing hard enough.

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:22.736
(Laughter)

00:03:24.014 --> 00:03:29.997
So every summer I bring onto the deck
of this little boat of ours

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:33.438
more and more things
that we know very little about.

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:38.304
I would like tonight
to tell you a story about life

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:41.668
that rarely gets told
in an environment like this.

00:03:42.915 --> 00:03:48.250
From the vantage point of our 21st-century
biological laboratories,

00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:52.191
we have begun to illuminate
many mysteries of life with knowledge.

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.506
We sense that after centuries
of scientific research,

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.637
we're beginning to make
significant inroads

00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:02.527
into understanding some of the most
fundamental principles of life.

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:08.224
Our collective optimism is reflected
by the growth of biotechnology

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.522
across the globe,

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:14.974
striving to utilize scientific knowledge
to cure human diseases.

00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:20.523
Things like cancer, aging,
degenerative diseases;

00:04:20.547 --> 00:04:24.879
these are but some
of the undesirables we wish to tame.

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:27.261
I often wonder:

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:30.446
Why is it that we are having
so much trouble

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.632
trying to solve the problem of cancer?

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:36.350
Is it that we're trying to solve
the problem of cancer,

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:38.668
and not trying to understand life?

00:04:39.657 --> 00:04:42.845
Life on this planet
shares a common origin,

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:47.922
and I can summarize 3.5 billion years
of the history of life on this planet

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:49.426
in a single slide.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.926
What you see here are representatives
of all known species in our planet.

00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.732
In this immensity of life
and biodiversity,

00:04:56.756 --> 00:04:59.923
we occupy a rather unremarkable position.

00:04:59.947 --> 00:05:00.963
(Laughter)

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:02.210
Homo sapiens.

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:04.621
The last of our kind.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.681
And though I don't really want
to disparage at all

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:10.676
the accomplishments of our species,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.686
as much as we wish it to be so
and often pretend that it is,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.586
we are not the measure of all things.

00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:22.798
We are, however, the measurers
of many things.

00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:27.057
We relentlessly quantify,
analyze and compare,

00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:30.861
and some of this is absolutely invaluable
and indeed necessary.

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:38.048
But this emphasis today on forcing
biological research to specialize

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:40.620
and to produce practical outcomes

00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:44.198
is actually restricting our ability
to interrogate life

00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:48.305
to unacceptably narrow confines
and unsatisfying depths.

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:54.048
We are measuring an astonishingly
narrow sliver of life,

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:57.848
and hoping that those numbers
will save all of our lives.

00:05:58.425 --> 00:05:59.818
How narrow do you ask?

00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:01.446
Well, let me give you a number.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.989
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration recently estimated

00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:09.940
that about 95 percent of our oceans
remain unexplored.

00:06:10.674 --> 00:06:12.386
Now let that sink in for a second.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.877
95 percent of our oceans
remain unexplored.

00:06:17.712 --> 00:06:19.877
I think it's very safe to say

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:24.730
that we don't even know
how much about life we do not know.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.735
So, it's not surprising
that every week in my field

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.970
we begin to see the addition
of more and more new species

00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:34.253
to this amazing tree of life.

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:35.674
This one for example --

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:37.604
discovered earlier this summer,

00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:38.841
new to science,

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:42.157
and now occupying its lonely branch
in our family tree.

00:06:42.973 --> 00:06:44.124
What is even more tragic

00:06:44.148 --> 00:06:47.783
is that we know about a bunch
of other species of animals out there,

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:51.368
but their biology remains
sorely under-studied.

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:53.726
I'm sure some of you
have heard about the fact

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.946
that a starfish can actually
regenerate its arm after it's lost.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.412
But some of you might not know

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:03.785
that the arm itself can actually
regenerate a complete starfish.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:08.807
And there are animals out there
that do truly astounding things.

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.171
I'm almost willing to bet

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:15.514
that many of you have never heard
of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.

00:07:16.423 --> 00:07:18.522
This little guy right here

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:21.620
does things that essentially
just blow my mind.

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:26.135
You can grab one of these animals
and cut it into 18 different fragments,

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.921
and each and every one of those fragments
will go on to regenerate

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:31.263
a complete animal

00:07:31.287 --> 00:07:32.921
in under two weeks.

00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:37.931
18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.

00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:40.744
For the past decade and a half or so,

00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:44.478
I've been trying to figure out
how these little dudes do what they do,

00:07:44.502 --> 00:07:46.701
and how they pull this magic trick off.

00:07:46.725 --> 00:07:48.439
But like all good magicians,

00:07:48.463 --> 00:07:51.318
they're not really releasing
their secrets readily to me.

00:07:51.342 --> 00:07:52.548
(Laughter)

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:53.730
So here we are,

00:07:53.754 --> 00:07:58.209
after 20 years of essentially
studying these animals,

00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:00.540
genome mapping, chin scratching,

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:03.783
and thousands of amputations
and thousands of regenerations,

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:07.602
we still don't fully understand
how these animals do what they do.

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:11.624
Each planarian an ocean unto itself,

00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:13.254
full of unknowns.

00:08:14.476 --> 00:08:16.160
One of the common characteristics

00:08:16.184 --> 00:08:18.796
of all of these animals
I've been talking to you about

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.583
is that they did not appear
to have received the memo

00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:24.274
that they need to behave
according to the rules

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:28.467
that we have derived from a handful
of randomly selected animals

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.213
that currently populate the vast majority

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:33.754
of biomedical laboratories
across the world.

00:08:34.117 --> 00:08:36.347
Meet our Nobel Prize winners.

00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:38.373
Seven species, essentially,

00:08:38.397 --> 00:08:41.999
that have produced for us the brunt
of our understanding

00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:44.490
of biological behavior today.

00:08:45.172 --> 00:08:46.964
This little guy right here --

00:08:46.988 --> 00:08:49.458
three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.

00:08:50.204 --> 00:08:52.960
And yet, after all the attention
they have garnered,

00:08:52.984 --> 00:08:55.044
and all the knowledge they have generated,

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:57.093
as well as the lion's share
of the funding,

00:08:57.117 --> 00:09:00.990
here we are standing [before] the same
litany of intractable problems

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:02.638
and many new challenges.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.035
And that's because, unfortunately,

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:07.673
these seven animals essentially correspond

00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:14.473
to 0.0009 percent of all of the species
that inhabit the planet.

00:09:15.962 --> 00:09:18.348
So I'm beginning to suspect

00:09:18.372 --> 00:09:23.133
that our specialization is beginning
to impede our progress at best,

00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:25.584
and at worst, is leading us astray.

00:09:26.235 --> 00:09:29.309
That's because life
on this planet and its history

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.050
is the history of rule breakers.

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:34.780
Life started on the face of this planet
as single-cell organisms,

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:37.126
swimming for millions
of years in the ocean,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.436
until one of those creatures decided,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.519
"I'm going to do things differently today;

00:09:41.543 --> 00:09:44.551
today I would like to invent
something called multicellularity,

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:45.848
and I'm going to do this."

00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:48.524
And I'm sure it wasn't a popular
decision at the time --

00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:49.575
(Laughter)

00:09:49.599 --> 00:09:51.205
but somehow, it managed to do it.

00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:53.795
And then, multicellular
organisms began to populate

00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:55.195
all these ancestral oceans,

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:56.407
and they thrived.

00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:57.964
And we have them here today.

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:01.786
Land masses began to emerge
from the surface of the oceans,

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.264
and another creature thought,

00:10:03.288 --> 00:10:06.077
"Hey, that looks like a really nice
piece of real estate.

00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:07.352
I'd like to move there."

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:08.535
"Are you crazy?

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.843
You're going to desiccate out there.
Nothing can live out of water."

00:10:11.867 --> 00:10:13.024
But life found a way,

00:10:13.048 --> 00:10:15.371
and there are organisms
now that live on land.

00:10:15.395 --> 00:10:17.793
Once on land, they may have
looked up into the sky

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.076
and said, "It would be nice
to go to the clouds,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.251
I'm going to fly."

00:10:21.275 --> 00:10:24.350
"You can't break the law of gravity,
there's no way you can fly."

00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.659
And yet, nature has invented --

00:10:26.683 --> 00:10:28.690
multiple and independent times --

00:10:28.714 --> 00:10:29.921
ways to fly.

00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:32.885
I love to study these animals
that break the rules,

00:10:32.909 --> 00:10:36.538
because every time they break a rule,
they invent something new

00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:40.321
that made it possible for us
to be able to be here today.

00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:42.894
These animals did not get the memo.

00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:44.618
They break the rules.

00:10:44.642 --> 00:10:47.437
So if we're going to study animals
that break the rules,

00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.456
shouldn't how we study them
also break the rules?

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:55.054
I think we need to renew
our spirit of exploration.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.924
Rather than bring nature
into our laboratories

00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:59.263
and interrogate it there,

00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:00.993
we need to bring our science

00:11:01.017 --> 00:11:03.922
into the majestic laboratory
that is nature,

00:11:03.946 --> 00:11:07.857
and there, with our modern
technological armamentarium,

00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:10.707
interrogate every new form
of life we find,

00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:13.724
and any new biological attribute
that we may find.

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:18.640
We actually need to bring
all of our intelligence

00:11:18.664 --> 00:11:20.756
to becoming stupid again --

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.639
clueless [before] the immensity
of the unknown.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:26.477
Because after all,

00:11:26.501 --> 00:11:28.660
science is not really about knowledge.

00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:31.425
Science is about ignorance.

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:32.814
That's what we do.

00:11:32.838 --> 00:11:35.969
Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,

00:11:35.993 --> 00:11:37.794
"If you want to build a ship,

00:11:37.818 --> 00:11:39.762
don't drum up people to collect wood

00:11:39.786 --> 00:11:42.088
and don't assign them tasks and work,

00:11:42.112 --> 00:11:46.206
but rather teach them to long
for the endless immensity of the sea ..."

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:48.350
As a scientist and a teacher,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:50.335
I like to paraphrase this to read

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:53.517
that we scientists need
to teach our students

00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:55.992
to long for the endless
immensity of the sea

00:11:56.016 --> 00:11:57.453
that is our ignorance.

00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:02.633
We Homo sapiens are the only
species we know of

00:12:02.657 --> 00:12:05.093
that is driven to scientific inquiry.

00:12:05.645 --> 00:12:07.779
We, like all other species on this planet,

00:12:07.803 --> 00:12:12.294
are inextricably woven
into the history of life on this planet.

00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:16.156
And I think I'm a little wrong
when I say that life is a mystery,

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.891
because I think that life
is actually an open secret

00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:22.899
that has been beckoning our species
for millennia to understand it.

00:12:23.344 --> 00:12:24.945
So I ask you:

00:12:24.969 --> 00:12:28.742
Aren't we the best chance
that life has to know itself?

00:12:29.053 --> 00:12:30.204
And if so,

00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:31.958
what the heck are we waiting for?

00:12:32.368 --> 00:12:33.569
Thank you.

00:12:33.593 --> 00:12:36.847
(Applause)
