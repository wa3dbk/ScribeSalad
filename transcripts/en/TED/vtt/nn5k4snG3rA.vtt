00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:19.354
Let me tell you, it has been a fantastic month for deception.

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:23.607
And I'm not even talking about the American presidential race. (Laughter)

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:27.942
We have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism,

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:30.874
a young superstar writer whose book involves

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:34.179
so many made up quotes that they've pulled it from the shelves;

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.777
a New York Times exposé on fake book reviews.

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:38.186
It's been fantastic.

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:42.037
Now, of course, not all deception hits the news.

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:45.716
Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:50.047
shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:52.980
So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.880
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.807
in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib,

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.358
or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?

00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:03.262
All right, good. These are all the liars.

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.555
Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.701
No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.553
The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,

00:01:11.553 --> 00:01:14.213
or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,

00:01:14.213 --> 00:01:18.263
very devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,

00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:21.617
which suggests that lying is very pervasive.

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:25.578
It's this pervasiveness, combined with the centrality

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:28.018
to what it means to be a human, the fact that we can

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:29.898
tell the truth or make something up,

00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:32.749
that has fascinated people throughout history.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.378
Here we have Diogenes with his lantern.

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:38.058
Does anybody know what he was looking for?

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:41.842
A single honest man, and he died without finding one

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.859
back in Greece. And we have Confucius in the East

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.236
who was really concerned with sincerity,

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:50.320
not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.474
but that you believed in what you were doing.

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:55.480
You believed in your principles.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.411
Now my first professional encounter with deception

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:01.874
is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.

00:02:01.874 --> 00:02:05.673
I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:08.499
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.281
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:17.311
that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)

00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.848
Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception

00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:23.903
while doing my duty here in customs,

00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:26.787
one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.539
and I'll tell you about some of that tonight.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:32.613
But even since just 1995, '96, the way we communicate

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:35.910
has been completely transformed. We email, we text,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.523
we skype, we Facebook. It's insane.

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.784
Almost every aspect of human communication's been changed,

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:44.344
and of course that's had an impact on deception.

00:02:44.344 --> 00:02:46.927
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:49.303
we've been tracking and documenting.

00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:53.547
They're called the Butler, the Sock Puppet

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:55.628
and the Chinese Water Army.

00:02:55.628 --> 00:02:57.525
It sounds a little bit like a weird book,

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.658
but actually they're all new types of lies.

00:02:59.658 --> 00:03:02.703
Let's start with the Butlers. Here's an example of one:

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:05.816
"On my way." Anybody ever written, "On my way?"

00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:09.579
Then you've also lied. (Laughter)

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.776
We're never on our way. We're thinking about going on our way.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.539
Here's another one: "Sorry I didn't respond to you earlier.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.504
My battery was dead." Your battery wasn't dead.

00:03:18.504 --> 00:03:20.380
You weren't in a dead zone.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.333
You just didn't want to respond to that person that time.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.130
Here's the last one: You're talking to somebody,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.620
and you say, "Sorry, got work, gotta go."

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.417
But really, you're just bored. You want to talk to somebody else.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:32.833
Each of these is about a relationship,

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:37.238
and this is a 24/7 connected world. Once you get my cell phone number,

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:40.203
you can literally be in touch with me 24 hours a day.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.572
And so these lies are being used by people

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:45.398
to create a buffer, like the butler used to do,

00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:48.805
between us and the connections to everybody else.

00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:50.512
But they're very special. They use ambiguity

00:03:50.512 --> 00:03:52.573
that comes from using technology. You don't know

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:55.521
where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:58.012
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.593
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:02.969
that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.393
or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:07.793
Our relationship is still important.

00:04:07.793 --> 00:04:09.307
Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,

00:04:09.307 --> 00:04:11.650
is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.715
about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:16.717
Let me give you a very recent example,

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:18.231
as in, like, last week.

00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:21.499
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.519
Here's one of his bestselling books.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:26.932
Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:29.589
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:33.397
"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:34.800
And of course, you might suspect

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.427
that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:42.114
He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:45.374
Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.

00:04:45.374 --> 00:04:48.541
Walt Whitman also did this back in the day,

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.596
before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:54.364
becomes interesting when we get to scale,

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.882
which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.

00:04:56.882 --> 00:04:59.318
Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people

00:04:59.318 --> 00:05:02.366
in China that are paid small amounts of money

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:05.400
to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.959
propaganda. The government hires these people,

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:10.587
companies hire them, all over the place.

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:14.204
In North America, we call this Astroturfing,

00:05:14.204 --> 00:05:17.642
and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.

00:05:17.642 --> 00:05:20.869
We see this especially with product reviews, book reviews,

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:25.664
everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not.

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:29.582
Now, looking at these three reviews, or these three types of deception,

00:05:29.582 --> 00:05:32.319
you might think, wow, the Internet is really making us

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.528
a deceptive species, especially when you think about

00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:40.130
the Astroturfing, where we can see deception brought up to scale.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.868
But actually, what I've been finding is very different from that.

00:05:44.868 --> 00:05:48.117
Now, let's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms,

00:05:48.117 --> 00:05:50.016
which I'm sure none of you have been in.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.345
I can assure you there's deception there.

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:55.054
And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:58.282
about getting the 43 million out of the country. (Laughter)

00:05:58.282 --> 00:05:59.962
Let's forget about that guy, too.

00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:02.906
Let's focus on the conversations between our friends

00:06:02.906 --> 00:06:05.053
and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones.

00:06:05.053 --> 00:06:07.461
Those are the conversations that really matter.

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.701
What does technology do to deception with those folks?

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:14.776
Here's a couple of studies. One of the studies we do

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:18.147
are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record

00:06:18.147 --> 00:06:21.713
all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:24.818
and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:27.766
per conversation within a medium, and the finding

00:06:27.766 --> 00:06:30.290
that we get that surprises people the most is that email

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.569
is the most honest of those three media.

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.970
And it really throws people for a loop because we think,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.706
well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?

00:06:39.706 --> 00:06:44.010
The phone, in contrast, the most lies.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.956
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device

00:06:45.956 --> 00:06:50.674
that people lie on the most, and perhaps because of the Butler Lie ambiguities I was telling you about.

00:06:50.674 --> 00:06:54.649
This tends to be very different from what people expect.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.873
What about résumés? We did a study in which we had

00:06:57.873 --> 00:07:00.417
people apply for a job, and they could apply for a job

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:03.931
either with a traditional paper résumé, or on LinkedIn,

00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:06.753
which is a social networking site like Facebook,

00:07:06.753 --> 00:07:10.320
but for professionals -- involves the same information as a résumé.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.934
And what we found, to many people's surprise,

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:15.729
was that those LinkedIn résumés were more honest

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:17.553
on the things that mattered to employers, like your

00:07:17.553 --> 00:07:21.704
responsibilities or your skills at your previous job.

00:07:21.704 --> 00:07:24.000
How about Facebook itself?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.882
You know, we always think that hey, there are these

00:07:25.882 --> 00:07:28.011
idealized versions, people are just showing the best things

00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:30.667
that happened in their lives. I've thought that many times.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:33.735
My friends, no way they can be that cool and have good of a life.

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:37.556
Well, one study tested this by examining people's personalities.

00:07:37.556 --> 00:07:41.774
They had four good friends of a person judge their personality.

00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:43.730
Then they had strangers, many strangers,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.258
judge the person's personality just from Facebook,

00:07:46.258 --> 00:07:48.687
and what they found was those judgments of the personality

00:07:48.687 --> 00:07:51.196
were pretty much identical, highly correlated,

00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:55.569
meaning that Facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality.

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.141
All right, well, what about online dating?

00:07:58.141 --> 00:07:59.641
I mean, that's a pretty deceptive space.

00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:03.176
I'm sure you all have "friends" that have used online dating. (Laughter)

00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:05.234
And they would tell you about that guy that had no hair

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.264
when he came, or the woman that didn't look at all like her photo.

00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:11.400
Well, we were really interested in it, and so what we did

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.507
is we brought people, online daters, into the lab,

00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:15.987
and then we measured them. We got their height

00:08:15.987 --> 00:08:19.868
up against the wall, we put them on a scale, got their weight --

00:08:19.868 --> 00:08:23.763
ladies loved that -- and then we actually got their driver's license to get their age.

00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:28.074
And what we found was very, very interesting.

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:32.003
Here's an example of the men and the height.

00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:34.473
Along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile.

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:39.335
Along the y-axis, the vertical axis, is how tall they actually were.

00:08:39.335 --> 00:08:42.411
That diagonal line is the truth line. If their dot's on it,

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.965
they were telling exactly the truth.

00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:47.078
Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.

00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:49.945
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.

00:08:49.945 --> 00:08:52.886
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,

00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:59.162
what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)

00:08:59.162 --> 00:09:03.665
You get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".

00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:05.663
But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.

00:09:05.663 --> 00:09:08.229
They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:10.637
was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie

00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:14.232
on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.

00:09:14.232 --> 00:09:17.256
One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:20.857
a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,

00:09:20.857 --> 00:09:24.476
game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied

00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:27.945
subtly, not too much. They were constrained.

00:09:27.945 --> 00:09:30.832
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact

00:09:30.832 --> 00:09:35.467
that despite our intuitions, mine included,

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.996
a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated

00:09:38.996 --> 00:09:43.024
communication, is more honest than face to face?

00:09:43.024 --> 00:09:45.513
That really is strange. How do we explain this?

00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:48.892
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.

00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:53.237
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.

00:09:53.237 --> 00:09:55.899
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.880
hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.116
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:07.232
really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:10.616
if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.

00:10:10.616 --> 00:10:13.808
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?

00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:16.338
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.

00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:18.697
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on

00:10:18.697 --> 00:10:20.942
when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out

00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:23.872
if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:26.302
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at

00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:29.030
is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.433
And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,

00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:34.296
one of the top cues is eyes. But the research

00:10:34.296 --> 00:10:38.120
over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.117
to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of

00:10:41.117 --> 00:10:43.472
the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.

00:10:43.472 --> 00:10:45.902
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.

00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:48.920
Some situations, yes -- high stakes, maybe their pupils dilate,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.424
their pitch goes up, their body movements change a little bit,

00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:57.256
but not all the time, not for everybody, it's not reliable.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.634
Strange. The other thing is that just because you can't see me

00:11:00.634 --> 00:11:03.053
doesn't mean I'm going to lie. It's common sense,

00:11:03.053 --> 00:11:05.960
but one important finding is that we lie for a reason.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.327
We lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain

00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:11.154
or for somebody else's gain.

00:11:11.154 --> 00:11:13.084
So there are some pathological liars, but they make up

00:11:13.084 --> 00:11:16.597
a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.

00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:18.228
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean

00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:20.499
we're going to necessarily lie.

00:11:20.499 --> 00:11:22.052
But I think there's actually something much more

00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:25.326
interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big

00:11:25.326 --> 00:11:29.123
thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going

00:11:29.123 --> 00:11:32.262
way back in history to the origins of language.

00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:36.149
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere

00:11:36.149 --> 00:11:39.317
between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.

00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:41.933
A lot of humans have lived since then.

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:44.356
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves

00:11:44.356 --> 00:11:47.463
and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,

00:11:47.463 --> 00:11:49.981
but they were doing a lot of talking, and like I said,

00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.526
there's a lot of humans evolving speaking,

00:11:52.526 --> 00:11:55.332
about 100 billion people in fact.

00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:58.114
What's important though is that writing only emerged

00:11:58.114 --> 00:12:01.701
about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:04.093
all the people before there was any writing,

00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:09.679
every word that they ever said, every utterance

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:14.431
disappeared. No trace. Evanescent. Gone.

00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:18.496
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which

00:12:18.496 --> 00:12:24.413
there is no record. In fact, even the next big change

00:12:24.413 --> 00:12:26.881
to writing was only 500 years ago now,

00:12:26.881 --> 00:12:29.260
with the printing press, which is very recent in our past,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.502
and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:36.886
so even the people of the last two millennia,

00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:41.918
most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:45.509
Let's turn to now, the networked age.

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:50.221
How many of you have recorded something today?

00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:53.398
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?

00:12:53.398 --> 00:12:57.624
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.

00:12:57.624 --> 00:13:00.672
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more

00:13:00.672 --> 00:13:05.214
than almost all of human pre-ancient history.

00:13:05.214 --> 00:13:08.444
That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period

00:13:08.444 --> 00:13:12.459
of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak

00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:15.160
in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.063
an environment where we're recording everything.

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:20.400
In fact, I think in the very near future, it's not just

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.749
what we write that will be recorded, everything we do

00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:25.082
will be recorded.

00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:29.538
What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that?

00:13:29.538 --> 00:13:33.788
Well, as a social scientist, this is the most amazing thing

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:37.335
I have ever even dreamed of. Now, I can look at

00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:40.946
all those words that used to, for millennia, disappear.

00:13:40.946 --> 00:13:45.194
I can look at lies that before were said and then gone.

00:13:45.194 --> 00:13:48.714
You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were

00:13:48.714 --> 00:13:52.217
talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,

00:13:52.217 --> 00:13:54.921
they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.

00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:57.356
So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of

00:13:57.356 --> 00:13:59.851
looking at the language, is we paid people

00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:03.386
to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.

00:14:03.386 --> 00:14:05.329
The person never was at the James Hotel.

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:08.251
The other review is real. The person stayed there.

00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:11.778
Now, your task now is to decide

00:14:11.778 --> 00:14:15.851
which review is fake?

00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:20.037
I'll give you a moment to read through them.

00:14:20.037 --> 00:14:22.324
But I want everybody to raise their hand at some point.

00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:26.555
Remember, I study deception. I can tell if you don't raise your hand.

00:14:26.555 --> 00:14:31.125
All right, how many of you believe that A is the fake?

00:14:33.154 --> 00:14:35.296
All right. Very good. About half.

00:14:35.296 --> 00:14:38.911
And how many of you think that B is?

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:41.440
All right. Slightly more for B.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.032
Excellent. Here's the answer.

00:14:44.032 --> 00:14:50.613
B is a fake. Well done second group. You dominated the first group. (Laughter)

00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:53.459
You're actually a little bit unusual. Every time we demonstrate this,

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:56.205
it's usually about a 50-50 split, which fits

00:14:56.205 --> 00:14:58.851
with the research, 54 percent. Maybe people here

00:14:58.851 --> 00:15:02.621
in Winnipeg are more suspicious and better at figuring it out.

00:15:02.621 --> 00:15:05.309
Those cold, hard winters, I love it.

00:15:05.309 --> 00:15:08.363
All right, so why do I care about this?

00:15:08.363 --> 00:15:11.631
Well, what I can do now with my colleagues in computer science

00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:14.863
is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze

00:15:14.863 --> 00:15:17.763
the linguistic traces of deception.

00:15:17.763 --> 00:15:19.596
Let me highlight a couple of things here

00:15:19.596 --> 00:15:23.039
in the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:24.627
about narrative. They make up a story:

00:15:24.627 --> 00:15:27.813
Who? And what happened? And that's what happened here.

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:30.102
Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with

00:15:30.102 --> 00:15:34.867
and what they were doing. They also used the first person singular, I,

00:15:34.867 --> 00:15:37.336
way more than the people that actually stayed there.

00:15:37.336 --> 00:15:42.032
They were inserting themselves into the hotel review,

00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:43.728
kind of trying to convince you they were there.

00:15:43.728 --> 00:15:47.743
In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there,

00:15:47.743 --> 00:15:50.175
their bodies actually entered the physical space,

00:15:50.175 --> 00:15:53.074
they talked a lot more about spatial information.

00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:55.591
They said how big the bathroom was, or they said,

00:15:55.591 --> 00:16:00.111
you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel.

00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:04.272
Now, you guys did pretty well. Most people perform at chance at this task.

00:16:04.272 --> 00:16:07.030
Our computer algorithm is very accurate, much more accurate

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.321
than humans can be, and it's not going to be accurate all the time.

00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:12.351
This isn't a deception-detection machine to tell

00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:14.852
if your girlfriend's lying to you on text messaging.

00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:18.416
We believe that every lie now, every type of lie --

00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:22.203
fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews,

00:16:22.203 --> 00:16:25.117
your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging --

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:26.622
those are all different lies. They're going to have

00:16:26.622 --> 00:16:29.481
different patterns of language. But because everything's

00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:34.170
recorded now, we can look at all of those kinds of lies.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.163
Now, as I said, as a social scientist, this is wonderful.

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:40.250
It's transformational. We're going to be able to learn

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:44.052
so much more about human thought and expression,

00:16:44.052 --> 00:16:48.450
about everything from love to attitudes,

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.410
because everything is being recorded now, but

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.814
what does it mean for the average citizen?

00:16:52.814 --> 00:16:55.616
What does it mean for us in our lives?

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:59.289
Well, let's forget deception for a bit. One of the big ideas,

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:02.977
I believe, is that we're leaving these huge traces behind.

00:17:02.977 --> 00:17:06.193
My outbox for email is massive,

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:09.530
and I never look at it. I write all the time,

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.968
but I never look at my record, at my trace.

00:17:12.968 --> 00:17:14.535
And I think we're going to see a lot more of that,

00:17:14.535 --> 00:17:17.696
where we can reflect on who we are by looking at

00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:21.314
what we wrote, what we said, what we did.

00:17:21.314 --> 00:17:23.586
Now, if we bring it back to deception, there's a couple

00:17:23.586 --> 00:17:25.563
of take-away things here.

00:17:25.563 --> 00:17:30.051
First, lying online can be very dangerous, right?

00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:32.757
Not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine,

00:17:32.757 --> 00:17:37.032
but you're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to,

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:38.792
and you're also leaving them around for me to analyze

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.246
with some computer algorithms.

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:43.419
So by all means, go ahead and do that, that's good.

00:17:43.419 --> 00:17:47.573
But when it comes to lying and what we want to do

00:17:47.573 --> 00:17:50.126
with our lives, I think we can go back to

00:17:50.126 --> 00:17:53.875
Diogenes and Confucius. And they were less concerned

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.707
about whether to lie or not to lie, and more concerned about

00:17:56.707 --> 00:17:59.992
being true to the self, and I think this is really important.

00:17:59.992 --> 00:18:04.175
Now, when you are about to say or do something,

00:18:04.175 --> 00:18:08.735
we can think, do I want this to be part of my legacy,

00:18:08.735 --> 00:18:11.448
part of my personal record?

00:18:11.448 --> 00:18:14.105
Because in the digital age we live in now,

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:18.569
in the networked age, we are all leaving a record.

00:18:18.569 --> 00:18:20.264
Thank you so much for your time,

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:24.711
and good luck with your record. (Applause)
