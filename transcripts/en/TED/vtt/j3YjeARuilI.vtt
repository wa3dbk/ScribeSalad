00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.378
Mobility in developing world cities

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:17.536
is a very peculiar challenge,

00:00:17.536 --> 00:00:19.341
because different from health

00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:21.651
or education or housing,

00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:25.085
it tends to get worse as societies become richer.

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.869
Clearly, a unsustainable model.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.196
Mobility, as most other developing country problems,

00:00:32.196 --> 00:00:36.101
more than a matter of money or technology,

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:41.492
is a matter of equality, equity.

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:44.601
The great inequality in developing countries

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.026
makes it difficult to see, for example,

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:50.590
that in terms of transport,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.520
an advanced city is not one

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.542
where even the poor use cars,

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.565
but rather one where even the rich

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:58.789
use public transport.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.355
Or bicycles: For example, in Amsterdam,

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:04.385
more than 30 percent of the population

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:05.920
uses bicycles,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.818
despite the fact that the Netherlands has

00:01:07.818 --> 00:01:11.801
a higher income per capita than the United States.

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.658
There is a conflict in developing world cities

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:18.226
for money, for government investment.

00:01:18.226 --> 00:01:20.727
If more money is invested in highways,

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:22.739
of course there is less money for housing,

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:25.096
for schools, for hospitals,

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:29.072
and also there is a conflict for space.

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:31.498
There is a conflict for space between

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:34.023
those with cars and those without them.

00:01:34.023 --> 00:01:35.866
Most of us accept today

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.650
that private property and a market economy

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.848
is the best way to manage
most of society's resources.

00:01:41.848 --> 00:01:44.253
However, there is a problem with that,

00:01:44.253 --> 00:01:46.921
that market economy needs

00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.639
inequality of income in order to work.

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:51.181
Some people must make more money,

00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:52.732
some others less.

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:55.301
Some companies succeed. Others fail.

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:57.175
Then what kind of equality

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:58.780
can we hope for today

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.702
with a market economy?

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:02.638
I would propose two kinds

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:04.992
which both have much to do with cities.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:08.098
The first one is equality of quality of life,

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.886
especially for children,

00:02:09.886 --> 00:02:11.541
that all children should have,

00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.548
beyond the obvious health and education,

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:18.407
access to green spaces, to sports facilities,

00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:21.433
to swimming pools, to music lessons.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.924
And the second kind of equality

00:02:23.924 --> 00:02:28.207
is one which we could call "democratic equality."

00:02:28.207 --> 00:02:31.156
The first article in every constitution states

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:34.445
that all citizens are equal before the law.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:36.900
That is not just poetry.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.101
It's a very powerful principle.

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:41.687
For example, if that is true,

00:02:41.687 --> 00:02:43.572
a bus with 80 passengers

00:02:43.572 --> 00:02:46.301
has a right to 80 times more road space

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:49.173
than a car with one.

00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:53.566
We have been so used to inequality, sometimes,

00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:57.297
that it's before our noses and we do not see it.

00:02:57.297 --> 00:02:59.573
Less than 100 years ago,

00:02:59.573 --> 00:03:00.960
women could not vote,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.166
and it seemed normal,

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.850
in the same way that it seems normal today

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.782
to see a bus in traffic.

00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:12.733
In fact, when I became mayor,

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.701
applying that democratic principle

00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:18.113
that public good prevails over private interest,

00:03:18.113 --> 00:03:21.013
that a bus with 100 people

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.587
has a right to 100 times
more road space than a car,

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:26.601
we implemented a mass transit system

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.070
based on buses in exclusive lanes.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.512
We called it TransMilenio,
in order to make buses sexier.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:41.309
And one thing is that it is also a very beautiful
democratic symbol, because as buses zoom by,

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.473
expensive cars stuck in traffic,

00:03:45.473 --> 00:03:51.800
it clearly is almost a picture of democracy at work.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.629
In fact, it's not just a matter of equity.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.521
It doesn't take Ph.D.'s.

00:03:57.521 --> 00:03:59.793
A committee of 12-year-old children

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:01.799
would find out in 20 minutes

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.503
that the most efficient way to use scarce road space

00:04:05.503 --> 00:04:08.987
is with exclusive lanes for buses.

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:12.309
In fact, buses are not sexy,

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.456
but they are the only possible means

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:18.739
to bring mass transit to all areas

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.414
of fast growing developing cities.

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:24.589
They also have great capacity.

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:27.333
For example, this system in Guangzhou

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.038
is moving more passengers our direction

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:32.862
than all subway lines in China,

00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:35.353
except for one line in Beijing,

00:04:35.353 --> 00:04:37.690
at a fraction of the cost.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.804
We fought not just for space for buses,

00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:44.860
but we fought for space for people,

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.073
and that was even more difficult.

00:04:48.073 --> 00:04:50.858
Cities are human habitats,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:54.587
and we humans are pedestrians.

00:04:54.587 --> 00:04:57.651
Just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly

00:04:57.651 --> 00:05:00.443
or deer need to run, we need to walk.

00:05:00.443 --> 00:05:03.774
There is a really enormous conflict,

00:05:03.774 --> 00:05:06.775
when we are talking about developing country cities,

00:05:06.775 --> 00:05:09.454
between pedestrians and cars.

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:12.385
Here, what you see is a picture that shows

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:14.037
insufficient democracy.

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:17.129
What this shows is that people who walk

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.804
are third-class citizens

00:05:18.804 --> 00:05:20.139
while those who go in cars

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:21.954
are first-class citizens.

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.361
In terms of transport infrastructure,

00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:25.564
what really makes a difference

00:05:25.564 --> 00:05:28.110
between advanced and backward cities

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.202
is not highways or subways

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.466
but quality sidewalks.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:35.232
Here they made a flyover, probably very useless,

00:05:35.232 --> 00:05:39.190
and they forgot to make a sidewalk.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.514
This is prevailing all over the world.

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:45.299
Not even schoolchildren
are more important than cars.

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:47.540
In my city of Bogotá,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.894
we fought a very difficult battle

00:05:50.894 --> 00:05:53.668
in order to take space from cars,

00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:56.564
which had been parking on sidewalks for decades,

00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:59.679
in order to make space for people that should reflect

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.347
dignity of human beings,

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:04.196
and to make space for protected bikeways.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:06.941
First of all, I had black hair before that.

00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:08.917
(Laughter)

00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:12.173
And I was almost impeached in the process.

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.317
It is a very difficult battle.

00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:17.494
However, it was possible, finally,

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:20.732
after very difficult battles, to make a city

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:23.416
that would reflect some respect for human dignity,

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.211
that would show that those who walk are equally

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:27.032
important to those who have cars.

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:31.681
Indeed, a very important ideological
and political issue anywhere

00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:34.627
is how to distribute that most valuable resource

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:37.036
of a city, which is road space.

00:06:37.036 --> 00:06:39.873
A city could find oil or diamonds underground

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:41.964
and it would not be so valuable as road space.

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:45.125
How to distribute it between pedestrians,

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.227
bicycles, public transport and cars?

00:06:48.227 --> 00:06:51.018
This is not a technological issue,

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:54.542
and we should remember that in no constitution

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.863
parking is a constitutional right

00:06:56.863 --> 00:06:59.364
when we make that distribution.

00:06:59.364 --> 00:07:02.995
We also built, and this was 15 years ago,

00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:04.933
before there were bikeways in New York

00:07:04.933 --> 00:07:06.377
or in Paris or in London,

00:07:06.377 --> 00:07:08.824
it was a very difficult battle as well,

00:07:08.824 --> 00:07:13.644
more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways.

00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:15.568
I don't think protected bicycle ways

00:07:15.568 --> 00:07:18.322
are a cute architectural feature.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:21.028
They are a right, just as sidewalks are,

00:07:21.028 --> 00:07:23.226
unless we believe that only those

00:07:23.226 --> 00:07:25.560
with access to a motor vehicle

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.627
have a right to safe mobility,

00:07:27.627 --> 00:07:29.900
without the risk of getting killed.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.567
And just as busways are,

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.658
protected bikeways also are

00:07:35.658 --> 00:07:37.537
a powerful symbol of democracy,

00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:41.187
because they show that a citizen on a $30 bicycle

00:07:41.187 --> 00:07:43.609
is equally important

00:07:43.609 --> 00:07:47.551
to one in a $30,000 car.

00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:51.268
And we are living in a unique moment in history.

00:07:51.268 --> 00:07:55.720
In the next 50 years, more than half of those cities

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.282
which will exist in the year 2060 will be built.

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:02.580
In many developing country cities,

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.640
more than 80 and 90 percent

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.342
of the city which will exist in 2060

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:11.703
will be built over the next four or five decades.

00:08:11.703 --> 00:08:14.825
But this is not just a matter
for developing country cities.

00:08:14.825 --> 00:08:16.814
In the United States, for example,

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:19.479
more than 70 million new homes

00:08:19.479 --> 00:08:22.176
must be built over the next 40 or 50 years.

00:08:22.176 --> 00:08:25.249
That's more than all the homes that today exist

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:29.765
in Britain, France and Canada put together.

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:33.122
And I believe that our cities today

00:08:33.122 --> 00:08:35.237
have severe flaws,

00:08:35.237 --> 00:08:38.795
and that different, better ones could be built.

00:08:38.795 --> 00:08:41.243
What is wrong with our cities today?

00:08:41.243 --> 00:08:45.477
Well, for example, if we tell any three-year-old child

00:08:45.477 --> 00:08:47.182
who is barely learning to speak

00:08:47.182 --> 00:08:48.693
in any city in the world today,

00:08:48.693 --> 00:08:50.375
"Watch out, a car,"

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:52.937
the child will jump in fright,

00:08:52.937 --> 00:08:54.716
and with a very good reason, because there are

00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:57.273
more than 10,000 children who are killed

00:08:57.273 --> 00:09:00.742
by cars every year in the world.

00:09:00.742 --> 00:09:03.350
We have had cities for 8,000 years,

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.686
and children could walk out of home and play.

00:09:07.686 --> 00:09:09.978
In fact, only very recently,

00:09:09.978 --> 00:09:11.812
towards 1900, there were no cars.

00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:15.813
Cars have been here for really
less than 100 years.

00:09:15.813 --> 00:09:18.587
They completely changed cities.

00:09:18.587 --> 00:09:20.535
In 1900, for example,

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:24.421
nobody was killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:26.336
Only 20 years later,

00:09:26.336 --> 00:09:29.731
between 1920 and 1930,

00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:32.089
almost 200,000 people

00:09:32.089 --> 00:09:34.599
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:34.599 --> 00:09:38.630
Only in 1925, almost 7,000 children

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.582
were killed by cars in the United States.

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:46.585
So we could make different cities,

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:49.346
cities that will give more priority to human beings

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:51.805
than to cars, that will give more public space

00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:53.929
to human beings than to cars,

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:56.684
cities which show great respect

00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:58.845
for those most vulnerable citizens,

00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:00.629
such as children or the elderly.

00:10:00.629 --> 00:10:04.434
I will propose to you a couple of ingredients

00:10:04.434 --> 00:10:07.776
which I think would make cities much better,

00:10:07.776 --> 00:10:10.261
and it would be very simple to implement them

00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:13.185
in the new cities which are only being created.

00:10:13.185 --> 00:10:16.238
Hundreds of kilometers of greenways

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:19.388
criss-crossing cities in all directions.

00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:22.132
Children will walk out of homes into safe spaces.

00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:25.093
They could go for dozens of kilometers safely

00:10:25.093 --> 00:10:28.147
without any risk in wonderful greenways,

00:10:28.147 --> 00:10:30.563
sort of bicycle highways,

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.668
and I would invite you to imagine the following:

00:10:33.668 --> 00:10:36.906
a city in which every other street would be

00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:41.977
a street only for pedestrians and bicycles.

00:10:41.992 --> 00:10:44.223
In new cities which are going to be built,

00:10:44.223 --> 00:10:46.768
this would not be particularly difficult.

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:50.295
When I was mayor of Bogotá,

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:52.825
in only three years, we were able to create

00:10:52.825 --> 00:10:54.963
70 kilometers,

00:10:54.963 --> 00:10:57.459
in one of the most dense cities in the world,

00:10:57.459 --> 00:10:59.826
of these bicycle highways.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:03.216
And this changes the way people live,

00:11:03.216 --> 00:11:05.888
move, enjoy the city.

00:11:05.888 --> 00:11:08.509
In this picture, you see in one
of the very poor neighborhoods,

00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:11.579
we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street,

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:13.940
and the cars still in the mud.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.763
Of course, I would love to pave this street for cars.

00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:18.211
But what do we do first?

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:21.372
Ninety-nine percent of the people
in those neighborhoods don't have cars.

00:11:21.372 --> 00:11:23.845
But you see, when a city is only being created,

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:25.935
it's very easy to incorporate

00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.111
this kind of infrastructure.

00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:30.809
Then the city grows around it.

00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:33.852
And of course this is just a glimpse

00:11:33.852 --> 00:11:36.647
of something which could be much better

00:11:36.647 --> 00:11:38.365
if we just create it,

00:11:38.365 --> 00:11:40.702
and it changes the way of life.

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:44.768
And the second ingredient,
which would solve mobility,

00:11:44.768 --> 00:11:47.346
that very difficult challenge in developing countries,

00:11:47.346 --> 00:11:50.341
in a very low-cost and simple way,

00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:54.353
would be to have hundreds of kilometers

00:11:54.353 --> 00:11:56.875
of streets only for buses,

00:11:56.875 --> 00:11:59.979
buses and bicycles and pedestrians.

00:11:59.979 --> 00:12:03.018
This would be, again, a very low-cost solution

00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:05.341
if implemented from the start,

00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:07.864
low cost, pleasant transit

00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:11.562
with natural sunlight.

00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:16.210
But unfortunately, reality is not as good

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.962
as my dreams.

00:12:17.962 --> 00:12:21.144
Because of private property of land

00:12:21.144 --> 00:12:24.165
and high land prices,

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:27.202
all developing country cities
have a large problem of slums.

00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:30.112
In my country of Colombia, almost half the homes

00:12:30.112 --> 00:12:35.458
in cities initially were illegal developments.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:38.670
And of course it's very difficult to have

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.626
mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments.

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:44.672
But even legal developments

00:12:44.672 --> 00:12:47.644
have also been located in the wrong places,

00:12:47.644 --> 00:12:50.445
very far from the city centers

00:12:50.445 --> 00:12:52.482
where it's impossible to provide

00:12:52.482 --> 00:12:56.313
low-cost, high-frequency public transport.

00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:59.193
As a Latin American, and Latin America

00:12:59.193 --> 00:13:02.620
was the most recently organized region in the world,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.780
I would recommend, respectfully, passionately,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.890
to those countries which are yet to urbanize --

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.911
Latin America went from 40 percent urban in 1950

00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:22.984
to 80 percent urban in 2010 --

00:13:22.984 --> 00:13:26.144
I would recommend Asian and African countries

00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:27.926
which are yet to urbanize,

00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:32.093
such as India which is only 33 percent urban now,

00:13:32.093 --> 00:13:35.068
that governments should acquire
all land around cities.

00:13:35.068 --> 00:13:37.589
In this way, their cities could grow in the right places

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:39.364
with the right spaces, with the parks,

00:13:39.364 --> 00:13:42.740
with the greenways, with the busways.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.255
The cities we are going to build

00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:46.095
over the next 50 years

00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:48.492
will determine quality of life and even happiness

00:13:48.492 --> 00:13:50.646
for billions of people towards the future.

00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:54.224
What a fantastic opportunity for leaders

00:13:54.224 --> 00:13:56.466
and many young leaders to come,

00:13:56.466 --> 00:13:58.533
especially in the developing countries.

00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.380
They can create a much happier life

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.949
for billions towards the future.

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:03.912
I am sure, I am optimistic,

00:14:03.912 --> 00:14:05.820
that they will make cities better

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.989
than our most ambitious dreams.

00:14:08.989 --> 00:14:12.866
(Applause)
