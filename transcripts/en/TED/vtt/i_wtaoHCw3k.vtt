00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.310
Come with me to Agbogbloshie,

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:19.120
a neighborhood in the heart of Accra,

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:22.648
named after a god that lives
in the Odaw River.

00:00:23.503 --> 00:00:26.317
There's a slum, Old Fadama,

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.116
built on land reclaimed
from the Korle Lagoon,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.844
just before it opens
into the Gulf of Guinea.

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:38.016
There's a scrapyard here where people
take apart all kinds of things,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.370
from mobile phones to computers,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.151
automobiles to even entire airplanes.

00:00:43.936 --> 00:00:46.475
Agbogbloshie's scrapyard is famous

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.978
because it has become a symbol
of the downside of technology:

00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:53.631
the problem of planned obsolescence.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:59.342
It's seen as a place where devices
from around the world end their life,

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.167
where your data comes to die.

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:06.524
These are the images
that the media loves to show,

00:01:06.548 --> 00:01:11.370
of young men and boys
burning wires and cables

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:14.115
to recover copper and aluminum,

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.538
using Styrofoam and old tires as fuel,

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:20.628
seriously hurting themselves
and the environment.

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.084
It's a super-toxic process,

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:27.985
producing pollutants that enter
the global ecosystem,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.125
build up in fatty tissue

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.595
and threaten the top of the food chain.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.537
But this story is incomplete.

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:41.802
There's a lot we can learn
from Agbogbloshie,

00:01:41.826 --> 00:01:46.355
where scrap collected
from city- and nationwide is brought.

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:48.449
For so many of us,

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:50.694
our devices are black boxes.

00:01:50.718 --> 00:01:52.133
We know what they do,

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:54.847
but not how they work or what's inside.

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.277
In Agbogbloshie, people
make it their business

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:00.358
to know exactly what's inside.

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:05.918
Scrap dealers recover copper,
aluminum, steel, glass, plastic

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:07.882
and printed circuit boards.

00:02:07.906 --> 00:02:09.828
It's called "urban mining."

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:15.056
It's now more efficient for us
to mine materials from our waste.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.830
There is 10 times more gold,
silver, platinum, palladium

00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:23.210
in one ton of our electronics

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:27.192
than in one ton of ore mined
from beneath the surface of the earth.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.171
In Agbogbloshie,

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:33.275
weight is a form of currency.

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:38.924
Devices are dissected to recover
materials, parts and components

00:02:38.948 --> 00:02:40.764
with incredible attention to detail,

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:43.916
down to the aluminum tips
of electric plugs.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.884
But scrap dealers don't destroy
components that are still functional.

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:53.926
They supply them to repair workshops
like this one in Agbogbloshie

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.443
and the tens of thousands
of technicians across the country

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:02.558
that refurbish electrical
and electronic equipment,

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:06.370
and sell them as used products
to consumers that may not be able to buy

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.542
a new television or a new computer.

00:03:10.463 --> 00:03:13.677
Make no mistake about it,
there are young hackers in Agbogbloshie --

00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:16.545
and I mean that in the very best
sense of that word --

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:20.011
that know not only
how to take apart computers

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:23.286
but how to put them back together,
how to give them new life.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:27.596
Agbogbloshie reminds us
that making is a cycle.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.872
It extends to remaking and unmaking

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:34.829
in order to recover the materials
that enable us to make something anew.

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:37.400
We can learn from Agbogbloshie,

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:41.275
where cobblers remake work boots,

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.639
where women collect plastic
from all over the city,

00:03:44.663 --> 00:03:46.161
sort it by type,

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:48.134
shred it, wash it

00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:51.248
and ultimately sell it back
as feedstock to factories

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:52.640
to make new clothing,

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:54.431
new plastic buckets

00:03:54.455 --> 00:03:55.616
and chairs.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:58.877
Steel is stockpiled separately,

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.831
where the carcasses of cars
and microwaves and washing machines

00:04:02.855 --> 00:04:05.149
become iron rods for new construction;

00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:07.724
where roofing sheets become cookstoves;

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:11.299
where shafts from cars become chisels

00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:14.830
that are used to scrap more objects;

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:19.127
where aluminum recovered
from the radiators of fridges

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.874
and air conditioners

00:04:21.898 --> 00:04:23.234
are melted down

00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:27.312
and use sand casting to make
ornaments for the building industry,

00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:31.267
for pots which are sold just down
the street in the Agbogbloshie market

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:37.627
with a full array of locally made
ovens, stoves and smokers,

00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:39.189
which are used every day

00:04:39.213 --> 00:04:42.619
to make the majority of palm nut soups,

00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.520
of tea and sugar breads,

00:04:44.544 --> 00:04:46.495
of grilled tilapia in the city.

00:04:47.322 --> 00:04:52.149
They're made in roadside workshops
like this one by welders like Mohammed,

00:04:52.173 --> 00:04:54.692
who recover materials
from the waste stream

00:04:54.716 --> 00:04:56.724
and use them to make all kinds of things,

00:04:56.748 --> 00:04:59.708
like dumbbells for working out
out of old car parts.

00:04:59.732 --> 00:05:01.224
But here's what's really cool:

00:05:01.248 --> 00:05:03.587
the welding machines
they use look like this,

00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:07.846
and they're made
by specially coiling copper

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.924
around electrical steel
recovered from old transformer scrap.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.050
There's an entire industry
just next to Agbogbloshie

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:22.653
making locally fabricated welding machines
that power local fabrication.

00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:27.358
What's really cool as well is that
there's a transfer of skills and knowledge

00:05:27.382 --> 00:05:28.812
across generations,

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:30.810
from masters to apprentices,

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:34.553
but it's done through active learning,
through heuristic learning,

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:36.524
learning by doing and by making.

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.765
And this stands in sharp contrast

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.198
to the experience
of many students in school,

00:05:41.222 --> 00:05:42.831
where lecturers lecture,

00:05:42.855 --> 00:05:45.560
and students write things down
and memorize them.

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.974
It's boring, but the real problem is

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:55.112
this somehow preempts their latent
or their inherent entrepreneurial power.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:57.785
They know books but not how to make stuff.

00:05:58.872 --> 00:06:02.966
Four years ago, my cofounder
Yasmine Abbas and I asked:

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.349
What would happen if we could couple

00:06:05.373 --> 00:06:09.009
the practical know-how of makers
in the informal sector

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:13.779
with the technical knowledge
of students and young professionals

00:06:13.803 --> 00:06:15.196
in STEAM fields --

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.017
science, technology, engineering,
arts and mathematics --

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.406
to build a STEAM-powered innovation engine

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.487
to drive what we call
"Sankofa Innovation," which I'll explain.

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:31.413
We took forays into the scrapyard

00:06:31.437 --> 00:06:34.281
to look for what could be repurposed,

00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:37.226
like DVD writers that could
become laser etchers,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.912
or the power supplies of old servers

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:44.891
for a start-up in Kumasi
making 3D printers out of e-waste.

00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:49.187
The key was to bring together
young people from different backgrounds

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.718
that ordinarily never have
anything to do with each other,

00:06:52.742 --> 00:06:56.462
to have a conversation
about how they could collaborate

00:06:56.486 --> 00:07:00.595
and to test and develop
new machines and tools

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.530
that could allow them to shred
and strip copper instead of burning it,

00:07:04.554 --> 00:07:07.708
to mold plastic bricks and tiles,

00:07:07.732 --> 00:07:13.286
to build new computers out of components
recovered from dead electronics,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.158
to build a drone.

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:20.770
And here you can see it flying
for the first time in Agbogbloshie.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.434
(Applause)

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.306
Yasmine and I have collaborated
with over 1,500 young people,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.681
750 from STEAM fields,

00:07:34.705 --> 00:07:39.258
and over 750 grassroots makers
and scrap dealers

00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:41.327
from Agbogbloshie and beyond.

00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.858
They've joined hands together
to develop a platform

00:07:46.665 --> 00:07:49.621
which they call Spacecraft,

00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:53.262
a hybrid physical and digital
space for crafting,

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:56.227
more of a process than a product,

00:07:56.251 --> 00:08:00.135
an open architecture for making,

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:01.840
which involves three parts:

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:04.868
a makerspace kiosk,
which is prefab and modular;

00:08:04.892 --> 00:08:09.094
tool kits which can be customized
based on what makers want to make;

00:08:09.118 --> 00:08:10.650
and a trading app.

00:08:10.674 --> 00:08:14.366
We built the app specifically
with the needs of the scrap dealers

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.811
in mind first,

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:20.309
because we realized that it was not enough
to arm them with information

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.947
and upgraded technology

00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.191
if we wanted them to green
their recycling processes;

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:27.127
they needed incentives.

00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:30.794
Scrap dealers are always looking
for new scrap and new buyers

00:08:30.818 --> 00:08:34.999
and what interests them
is finding buyers who will pay more

00:08:35.023 --> 00:08:37.388
for clean copper than for burnt.

00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:40.963
We realized that in the entire ecosystem,

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:43.456
everyone was searching for something.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.524
Makers are searching for materials,
parts, components, tools, blueprints

00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:51.613
to make what it is they want to make.

00:08:51.962 --> 00:08:55.597
They're also finding a way
to let customers and clientele

00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:57.812
find out that they can repair a blender

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:59.306
or fix an iron

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.583
or, as we learned yesterday,
to make a french fry machine.

00:09:03.496 --> 00:09:06.782
On the flip side, you find
that there are end users

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:10.724
that are desperately looking for someone
that can make them a french fry machine,

00:09:10.748 --> 00:09:14.461
and you have scrap dealers who are
looking how they can collect this scrap,

00:09:14.485 --> 00:09:18.437
process it, and turn it back
into an input for new making.

00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.503
We tried to untangle
that knot of not knowing

00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:24.958
to allow people to find what they need
to make what they want to make.

00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:28.644
We prototyped the makerspace
kiosk in Agbogbloshie,

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:31.466
conceived as the opposite of a school:

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.324
a portal into experiential
and experimental making

00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:37.425
that connects local and global

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:40.932
and connects making
with remaking and unmaking.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:45.135
We made a rule that everything
had to be made from scratch

00:09:45.159 --> 00:09:47.566
using only materials made in Ghana

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.454
or sourced from the scrapyard.

00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:54.750
The structures essentially are
simple trusses which bolt together.

00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:59.577
It takes about two hours to assemble
one module with semi-skilled labor,

00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:02.715
and by developing tooling
and jigs and rigs,

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:06.282
we were able to actually
build these standardized parts

00:10:06.306 --> 00:10:09.650
within this ecosystem of artisanal welders

00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:11.599
with the precision of one millimeter --

00:10:12.637 --> 00:10:15.672
of course, using made-in-Agbogbloshie
welding machines,

00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:17.139
as well as for the tools,

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:20.778
which can lock, the toolboxes,
and stack to make workbenches,

00:10:20.802 --> 00:10:23.430
and again, customized
based on what you want to make.

00:10:23.827 --> 00:10:26.879
We've tested the app in Agbogbloshie

00:10:26.903 --> 00:10:30.399
and are getting ready to open it up
to other maker ecosystems.

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:34.515
In six months, we'll have finished
three years of testing

00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:36.201
the makerspace kiosk,

00:10:36.225 --> 00:10:40.322
which I have to admit, we've subjected
to some pretty horrific abuse.

00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:42.275
But it's for a good cause,

00:10:42.299 --> 00:10:44.544
because based on
the results of that testing,

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:49.883
we've been able to redesign
an upgraded version of this makerspace.

00:10:49.907 --> 00:10:55.526
If a fab lab is large, expensive,
and fixed in place,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.574
think of this as the counterpoint:

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:00.091
something low-cost,

00:11:00.828 --> 00:11:03.991
which can be locally manufactured,

00:11:04.015 --> 00:11:07.610
which can be expanded
and kitted out incrementally

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:09.929
as makers acquire resources.

00:11:09.953 --> 00:11:12.803
You can think of it as a toolshed,

00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:15.952
where makers can come and check out tools

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:18.338
and take them via handcart

00:11:18.362 --> 00:11:21.721
to wherever they want in the city
to make what it is they want to make.

00:11:21.745 --> 00:11:24.692
And moving into the next phase,
we're planning to also add

00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:27.580
ceiling-mounted CNC bots,

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:31.381
which allow makers to cocreate
together with robots.

00:11:31.405 --> 00:11:33.663
Ultimately, this is a kit of parts

00:11:33.687 --> 00:11:37.056
which can be assembled locally
within the informal sector

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.911
using standardized parts

00:11:38.935 --> 00:11:42.641
which can be upgraded collectively
through an open-source process.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.167
In totality, this entire
makerspace system

00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.905
tries to do five things:

00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:56.129
to enable emerging makers
to gather the resources they need

00:11:56.153 --> 00:11:58.317
and the tools to make
what they want to make;

00:11:58.341 --> 00:12:01.199
to learn by doing and from others;

00:12:01.223 --> 00:12:04.194
to produce more and better products;

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.942
to be able to trade
to generate steady income;

00:12:06.966 --> 00:12:10.803
and ultimately, to amplify
not only their reputation as a maker,

00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:12.377
but their maker potential.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:17.794
Sankofa is one of the most powerful
Adinkra symbols of the Akan peoples

00:12:17.818 --> 00:12:19.166
in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.502
and it can be represented as a bird
reaching onto its back to collect an egg,

00:12:24.526 --> 00:12:25.744
a symbol of power.

00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:30.469
It translates literally from the Twi
as "return and get it,"

00:12:30.493 --> 00:12:35.226
and what this means is that if
an individual or a community or a society

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.006
wants to have a successful future,
they have to draw on the past.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.572
To acquire and master
existing ways of doing,

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.914
access the knowledge of their ancestors.

00:12:45.938 --> 00:12:47.153
And this is very relevant

00:12:47.177 --> 00:12:51.563
if we want to think about an inclusive
future for Africa today.

00:12:51.587 --> 00:12:53.990
We have to start from the ground up,

00:12:54.014 --> 00:12:58.017
mining what already works
for methods and for models,

00:12:58.041 --> 00:13:02.173
and to think about how might we
be able to connect,

00:13:02.197 --> 00:13:06.309
in a kind of "both-and,"
not "either-or" paradigm,

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:09.919
the innovation capacity
of this growing network

00:13:09.943 --> 00:13:13.188
of tech hubs and incubators
across the continent

00:13:13.212 --> 00:13:17.803
and to rethink beyond national boundaries
and political boundaries,

00:13:17.827 --> 00:13:22.117
to think about how we can network
innovation in Africa

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:24.660
with the spirit of Sankofa

00:13:24.684 --> 00:13:29.128
and the existing capacity
of makers at the grassroots.

00:13:30.033 --> 00:13:31.821
If, in the future, someone tells you

00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:35.385
Agbogbloshie is the largest
e-waste dump in the world,

00:13:35.409 --> 00:13:37.641
I hope you can correct them

00:13:37.665 --> 00:13:42.209
and explain to them that a dump
is a place where you throw things away

00:13:42.233 --> 00:13:43.601
and leave them forever;

00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.836
a scrapyard is where
you take things apart.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.077
Waste is something
that no longer has any value,

00:13:49.101 --> 00:13:51.735
whereas scrap is something
that you recover

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:55.539
specifically to use it
to remake something new.

00:13:57.523 --> 00:13:58.930
Making is a cycle,

00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:04.719
and African makerspaces
are already pioneering and leading

00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:08.607
circular economy at the grassroots.

00:14:09.128 --> 00:14:11.373
Let's make more and better together.

00:14:11.397 --> 00:14:12.564
Thank you.

00:14:12.588 --> 00:14:16.037
(Applause)
