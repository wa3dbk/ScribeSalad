00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:15.606
So I'm here to talk to you
about the walkable city.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.989
What is the walkable city?

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:19.494
Well, for want of a better definition,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:26.406
it's a city in which the car
is an optional instrument of freedom,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.314
rather than a prosthetic device.

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:31.293
And I'd like to talk about
why we need the walkable city,

00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:35.475
and I'd like to talk about
how to do the walkable city.

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:39.839
Most of the talks I give these days
are about why we need it,

00:00:39.863 --> 00:00:42.959
but you guys are smart.

00:00:44.134 --> 00:00:47.381
And also I gave that talk
exactly a month ago,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.472
and you can see it at TED.com.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.496
So today I want to talk
about how to do it.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.459
In a lot of time thinking about this,

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:57.583
I've come up with what I call
the general theory of walkability.

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:00.537
A bit of a pretentious term,
it's a little tongue-in-cheek,

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.135
but it's something
I've thought about for a long time,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.543
and I'd like to share
what I think I've figured out.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.406
In the American city,
the typical American city --

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.670
the typical American city
is not Washington, DC,

00:01:11.694 --> 00:01:14.002
or New York, or San Francisco;

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:17.273
it's Grand Rapids or Cedar
Rapids or Memphis --

00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:20.408
in the typical American city
in which most people own cars

00:01:20.432 --> 00:01:22.753
and the temptation
is to drive them all the time,

00:01:22.777 --> 00:01:26.556
if you're going to get them to walk,
then you have to offer a walk

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.428
that's as good as a drive or better.

00:01:28.452 --> 00:01:29.603
What does that mean?

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:32.168
It means you need to offer
four things simultaneously:

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.249
there needs to be a proper reason to walk,

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:36.623
the walk has to be safe and feel safe,

00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:38.342
the walk has to be comfortable

00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.135
and the walk has to be interesting.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.769
You need to do all four
of these things simultaneously,

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:44.823
and that's the structure of my talk today,

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:46.476
to take you through each of those.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.764
The reason to walk
is a story I learned from my mentors,

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:52.148
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:54.173
the founders of the New Urbanism movement.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.710
And I should say half the slides
and half of my talk today

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.060
I learned from them.

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:00.863
It's the story of planning,

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:04.127
the story of the formation
of the planning profession.

00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:08.902
When in the 19th century
people were choking

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:11.419
from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:15.819
the planners said, hey, let's move
the housing away from the mills.

00:02:15.843 --> 00:02:19.310
And lifespans increased
immediately, dramatically,

00:02:19.334 --> 00:02:20.485
and we like to say

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:23.701
the planners have been trying to repeat
that experience ever since.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:26.367
So there's the onset
of what we call Euclidean zoning,

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.466
the separation of the landscape
into large areas of single use.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.967
And typically when I arrive
in a city to do a plan,

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:37.030
a plan like this already awaits me
on the property that I'm looking at.

00:02:37.054 --> 00:02:38.756
And all a plan like this guarantees

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.819
is that you will not have a walkable city,

00:02:40.843 --> 00:02:43.763
because nothing is located
near anything else.

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.427
The alternative, of course,
is our most walkable city,

00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:49.981
and I like to say, you know,
this is a Rothko,

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:51.508
and this is a Seurat.

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:54.073
It's just a different way --
he was the pointilist --

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:55.930
it's a different way of making places.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.763
And even this map of Manhattan
is a bit misleading

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:02.967
because the red color
is uses that are mixed vertically.

00:03:02.991 --> 00:03:05.695
So this is the big story
of the New Urbanists --

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.231
to acknowledge
that there are only two ways

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.545
that have been tested by the thousands

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.509
to build communities,
in the world and throughout history.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:15.411
One is the traditional neighborhood.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:18.849
You see here several neighborhoods
of Newburyport, Massachusetts,

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:23.140
which is defined as being compact
and being diverse --

00:03:23.164 --> 00:03:27.306
places to live, work, shop,
recreate, get educated --

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.209
all within walking distance.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.369
And it's defined as being walkable.

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:32.927
There are lots of small streets.

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.677
Each one is comfortable to walk on.

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:37.215
And we contrast that to the other way,

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.058
an invention that happened
after the Second World War,

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:41.340
suburban sprawl,

00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:45.941
clearly not compact, clearly not diverse,
and it's not walkable,

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:47.863
because so few of the streets connect,

00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:50.770
that those streets that do connect
become overburdened,

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:52.884
and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.

00:03:52.908 --> 00:03:55.759
And I want to thank Alex Maclean,
the aerial photographer,

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:58.838
for many of these beautiful pictures
that I'm showing you today.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:02.482
So it's fun to break sprawl down
into its constituent parts.

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:04.083
It's so easy to understand,

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:07.110
the places where you only live,
the places where you only work,

00:04:07.964 --> 00:04:09.920
the places where you only shop,

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:13.288
and our super-sized public institutions.

00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:14.752
Schools get bigger and bigger,

00:04:14.776 --> 00:04:17.172
and therefore, further
and further from each other.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:20.325
And the ratio of the size
of the parking lot

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.565
to the size of the school

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.205
tells you all you need to know,

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.767
which is that no child
has ever walked to this school,

00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:27.696
no child will ever walk to this school.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.560
The seniors and juniors are driving
the freshmen and the sophomores,

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:34.208
and of course we have
the crash statistics to prove it.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.700
And then the super-sizing
of our other civic institutions

00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:38.894
like playing fields --

00:04:38.918 --> 00:04:42.791
it's wonderful that Westin
in the Ft. Lauderdale area

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.883
has eight soccer fields
and eight baseball diamonds

00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:47.766
and 20 tennis courts,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.402
but look at the road
that takes you to that location,

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:53.372
and would you let your child bike on it?

00:04:53.396 --> 00:04:55.526
And this is why we have
the soccer mom now.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.792
When I was young, I had one soccer field,

00:04:57.816 --> 00:04:59.841
one baseball diamond and one tennis court,

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.723
but I could walk to it,
because it was in my neighborhood.

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:05.598
Then the final part of sprawl
that everyone forgot to count:

00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:08.442
if you're going to separate everything
from everything else

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:11.000
and reconnect it
only with automotive infrastructure,

00:05:11.024 --> 00:05:13.546
then this is what your landscape
begins to look like.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.785
The main message here is:

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:18.411
if you want to have a walkable city,
you can't start with the sprawl model.

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:20.506
you need the bones of an urban model.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.378
This is the outcome
of that form of design,

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:24.793
as is this.

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:27.406
And this is something
that a lot of Americans want.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.143
But we have to understand
it's a two-part American dream.

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.527
If you're dreaming for this,

00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:34.932
you're also going to be dreaming of this,
often to absurd extremes,

00:05:34.956 --> 00:05:37.573
when we build our landscape
to accommodate cars first.

00:05:37.597 --> 00:05:39.838
And the experience
of being in these places --

00:05:39.862 --> 00:05:40.879
(Laughter)

00:05:40.903 --> 00:05:42.283
This is not Photoshopped.

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:44.309
Walter Kulash took this slide.

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:46.030
It's in Panama City.

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.843
This is a real place.

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:50.346
And being a driver
can be a bit of a nuisance,

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.835
and being a pedestrian
can be a bit of a nuisance

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:54.360
in these places.

00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:57.858
This is a slide that epidemiologists
have been showing for some time now,

00:05:57.882 --> 00:05:58.898
(Laughter)

00:05:58.922 --> 00:06:02.387
The fact that we have a society
where you drive to the parking lot

00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:04.285
to take the escalator to the treadmill

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:06.237
shows that we're doing something wrong.

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:07.833
But we know how to do it better.

00:06:07.857 --> 00:06:09.540
Here are the two models contrasted.

00:06:09.564 --> 00:06:10.719
I show this slide,

00:06:10.743 --> 00:06:13.529
which has been a formative document
of the New Urbanism now

00:06:13.553 --> 00:06:14.957
for almost 30 years,

00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:19.140
to show that sprawl and the traditional
neighborhood contain the same things.

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:20.550
It's just how big are they,

00:06:20.574 --> 00:06:22.173
how close are they to each other,

00:06:22.197 --> 00:06:23.872
how are they interspersed together

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.813
and do you have a street network,
rather than a cul-de-sac

00:06:26.837 --> 00:06:28.872
or a collector system of streets?

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:30.713
So when we look at a downtown area,

00:06:30.737 --> 00:06:32.872
at a place that has a hope
of being walkable,

00:06:32.896 --> 00:06:35.454
and mostly that's our downtowns
in America's cities

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.246
and towns and villages,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.335
we look at them and say
we want the proper balance of uses.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.494
So what is missing or underrepresented?

00:06:42.518 --> 00:06:46.178
And again, in the typical American cities
in which most Americans live,

00:06:46.202 --> 00:06:48.212
it is housing that is lacking.

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:50.426
The jobs-to-housing balance is off.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.633
And you find that when
you bring housing back,

00:06:52.657 --> 00:06:54.723
these other things start to come back too,

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.223
and housing is usually first
among those things.

00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:00.351
And, of course, the thing
that shows up last and eventually

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:01.556
is the schools,

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.900
because the people have to move in,

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:08.745
the young pioneers have to move in,
get older, have kids

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.807
and fight, and then the schools
get pretty good eventually.

00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.133
The other part of this part,

00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:17.648
the useful city part,

00:07:17.672 --> 00:07:18.977
is transit,

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:22.366
and you can have a perfectly
walkable neighborhood without it.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.695
But perfectly walkable cities
require transit,

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:29.160
because if you don't have access
to the whole city as a pedestrian,

00:07:29.184 --> 00:07:30.345
then you get a car,

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:31.524
and if you get a car,

00:07:31.548 --> 00:07:34.096
the city begins to reshape itself
around your needs,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.802
and the streets get wider
and the parking lots get bigger

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:38.703
and you no longer have a walkable city.

00:07:38.727 --> 00:07:39.882
So transit is essential.

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:42.307
But every transit experience,
every transit trip,

00:07:42.331 --> 00:07:44.226
begins or ends as a walk,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.048
and so we have to remember to build
walkability around our transit stations.

00:07:48.072 --> 00:07:50.817
Next category, the biggest one,
is the safe walk.

00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:53.057
It's what most walkability
experts talk about.

00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:57.122
It is essential, but alone not enough
to get people to walk.

00:07:57.146 --> 00:08:00.289
And there are so many moving parts
that add up to a walkable city.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:01.889
The first is block size.

00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:03.260
This is Portland, Oregon,

00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:06.850
famously 200-foot blocks,
famously walkable.

00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:08.192
This is Salt Lake City,

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:10.296
famously 600-foot blocks,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.689
famously unwalkable.

00:08:11.713 --> 00:08:14.719
If you look at the two,
it's almost like two different planets,

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:17.059
but these places were both built by humans

00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:20.723
and in fact, the story is that when
you have a 200-foot block city,

00:08:20.747 --> 00:08:22.281
you can have a two-lane city,

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:23.722
or a two-to-four lane city,

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:27.771
and a 600-foot block city
is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.

00:08:27.795 --> 00:08:29.273
These are the crash statistics.

00:08:29.297 --> 00:08:31.383
When you double the block size --

00:08:31.407 --> 00:08:33.440
this was a study
of 24 California cities --

00:08:33.464 --> 00:08:34.956
when you double the block size,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.606
you almost quadruple
the number of fatal accidents

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.631
on non-highway streets.

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:42.886
So how many lanes do we have?

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.387
This is where I'm going to tell you
what I tell every audience I meet,

00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:49.141
which is to remind you
about induced demand.

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:53.602
Induced demand applies
both to highways and to city streets.

00:08:53.626 --> 00:08:57.111
And induced demand tells us
that when we widen the streets

00:08:57.135 --> 00:09:00.233
to accept the congestion
that we're anticipating,

00:09:00.257 --> 00:09:02.594
or the additional trips
that we're anticipating

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:06.531
in congested systems,
it is principally that congestion

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.548
that is constraining demand,

00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:10.334
and so that the widening comes,

00:09:10.358 --> 00:09:13.474
and there are all of these latent trips
that are ready to happen.

00:09:13.498 --> 00:09:14.887
People move further from work

00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.144
and make other choices
about when they commute,

00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:19.542
and those lanes fill up
very quickly with traffic,

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:22.067
so we widen the street again,
and they fill up again.

00:09:22.091 --> 00:09:24.317
And we've learned that
in congested systems,

00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:26.756
we cannot satisfy the automobile.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.230
This is from Newsweek Magazine --
hardly an esoteric publication:

00:09:30.254 --> 00:09:31.922
"Today's engineers acknowledge

00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:35.172
that building new roads
usually makes traffic worse."

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:38.759
My response to reading this was,
may I please meet some of these engineers,

00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:40.849
because these are not the ones that I --

00:09:40.873 --> 00:09:43.463
there are great exceptions
that I'm working with now --

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:46.793
but these are not the engineers
one typically meets working in a city,

00:09:46.817 --> 00:09:50.283
where they say, "Oh, that road
is too crowded, we need to add a lane."

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:52.467
So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.948
and they say, "See, I told you
we needed that lane."

00:09:54.972 --> 00:09:58.764
This applies both to highways
and to city streets if they're congested.

00:09:58.788 --> 00:10:01.823
But the amazing thing
about most American cities that I work in,

00:10:01.847 --> 00:10:03.136
the more typical cities,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.192
is that they have a lot of streets
that are actually oversized

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:08.623
for the congestion
they're currently experiencing.

00:10:08.647 --> 00:10:10.370
This was the case in Oklahoma City,

00:10:10.394 --> 00:10:12.913
when the mayor came running
to me, very upset,

00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:15.341
because they were named
in Prevention Magazine

00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:18.518
the worst city for pedestrians
in the entire country.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:20.248
Now that can't possibly be true,

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:23.401
but it certainly is enough
to make a mayor do something about it.

00:10:23.425 --> 00:10:24.734
We did a walkability study,

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:28.093
and what we found, looking
at the car counts on the street --

00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:31.792
these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts

00:10:31.816 --> 00:10:35.763
and we know that two lanes
can handle 10,000 cars per day.

00:10:35.787 --> 00:10:40.444
Look at these numbers --
they're all near or under 10,000 cars,

00:10:40.468 --> 00:10:43.042
and these were the streets
that were designated

00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:45.278
in the new downtown plan

00:10:45.302 --> 00:10:47.936
to be four lanes to six lanes wide.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.205
So you had a fundamental disconnect
between the number of lanes

00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:53.471
and the number of cars
that wanted to use them.

00:10:53.495 --> 00:10:57.410
So it was my job to redesign
every street in the downtown

00:10:57.434 --> 00:10:59.169
from curb face to curb face,

00:10:59.193 --> 00:11:01.195
and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,

00:11:01.219 --> 00:11:02.576
and we're rebuilding it now.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.640
So a typical oversized street to nowhere

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:07.864
is being narrowed, and now
under construction,

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:09.528
and the project is half done.

00:11:09.552 --> 00:11:11.543
The typical street like this, you know,

00:11:11.567 --> 00:11:15.013
when you do that,
you find room for medians.

00:11:15.037 --> 00:11:17.019
You find room for bike lanes.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:19.210
We've doubled the amount
of on-street parking.

00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:23.183
We've added a full bike network
where one didn't exist before.

00:11:23.207 --> 00:11:26.454
But not everyone has the money
that Oklahoma City has,

00:11:26.478 --> 00:11:29.562
because they have an extraction
economy that's doing quite well.

00:11:29.586 --> 00:11:31.638
The typical city is more
like Cedar Rapids,

00:11:31.662 --> 00:11:35.652
where they have an all four-lane
system, half one-way system.

00:11:35.676 --> 00:11:37.125
And it's a little hard to see,

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:40.433
but what we've done -- what we're doing;
it's in process right now,

00:11:40.457 --> 00:11:42.061
it's in engineering right now --

00:11:42.085 --> 00:11:45.876
is turning an all four-lane
system, half one-way

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.477
into an all two-lane system, all two-way,

00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.742
and in so doing, we're adding
70 percent more on-street parking,

00:11:52.766 --> 00:11:54.125
which the merchants love,

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:55.569
and it protects the sidewalk.

00:11:55.593 --> 00:11:57.355
That parking makes the sidewalk safe,

00:11:57.379 --> 00:12:01.057
and we're adding a much more
robust bicycle network.

00:12:01.081 --> 00:12:03.662
Then the lanes themselves.
How wide are they?

00:12:03.686 --> 00:12:04.896
That's really important.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.086
The standards have changed
such that, as Andrés Duany says,

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.204
the typical road
to a subdivision in America

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:12.420
allows you to see
the curvature of the Earth.

00:12:12.444 --> 00:12:13.483
(Laughter)

00:12:13.507 --> 00:12:16.752
This is a subdivision
outside of Washington from the 1960s.

00:12:16.776 --> 00:12:19.097
Look very carefully
at the width of the streets.

00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:21.228
This is a subdivision from the 1980s.

00:12:21.252 --> 00:12:22.887
1960s, 1980s.

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:24.935
The standards have changed
to such a degree

00:12:24.959 --> 00:12:26.912
that my old neighborhood of South Beach,

00:12:26.936 --> 00:12:30.095
when it was time to fix the street
that wasn't draining properly,

00:12:30.119 --> 00:12:32.663
they had to widen it
and take away half our sidewalk,

00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:34.426
because the standards were wider.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.905
People go faster on wider streets.

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:39.086
People know this.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.236
The engineers deny it,
but the citizens know it,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.086
so that in Birmingham, Michigan,
they fight for narrower streets.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.632
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,

00:12:48.656 --> 00:12:52.201
instituted its "Skinny Streets" program
in its residential neighborhood.

00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:54.075
We know that skinny streets are safer.

00:12:54.099 --> 00:12:57.145
The developer Vince Graham,
in his project I'On,

00:12:57.169 --> 00:12:58.985
which we worked on in South Carolina,

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:02.924
he goes to conferences and he shows
his amazing 22-foot roads.

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:05.361
These are two-way roads,
very narrow rights of way,

00:13:05.385 --> 00:13:07.384
and he shows this well-known philosopher,

00:13:07.408 --> 00:13:10.278
who said, "Broad is the road
that leads to destruction ...

00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:12.403
narrow is the road that leads to life."

00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:14.487
(Laughter)

00:13:14.511 --> 00:13:16.880
(Applause)

00:13:16.904 --> 00:13:18.963
This plays very well in the South.

00:13:18.987 --> 00:13:20.884
Now: bicycles.

00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:26.231
Bicycles and bicycling
are the current revolution underway

00:13:26.255 --> 00:13:27.938
in only some American cities.

00:13:27.962 --> 00:13:29.603
But where you build it, they come.

00:13:29.627 --> 00:13:33.636
As a planner, I hate to say that,
but the one thing I can say

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.787
is that bicycle population
is a function of bicycle infrastructure.

00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:41.226
I asked my friend Tom Brennan
from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.830
to send me some pictures
of the Portland bike commute.

00:13:43.854 --> 00:13:46.362
He sent me this. I said,
"Was that bike to work day?"

00:13:46.386 --> 00:13:48.031
He said, "No, that was Tuesday."

00:13:48.055 --> 00:13:53.019
When you do what Portland did and spend
money on bicycle infrastructure --

00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:57.264
New York City has doubled the number
of bikers in it several times now

00:13:57.288 --> 00:13:59.325
by painting these bright green lanes.

00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:02.915
Even automotive cities
like Long Beach, California:

00:14:02.939 --> 00:14:07.018
vast uptick in the number of bikers
based on the infrastructure.

00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:08.733
And of course, what really does it,

00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:11.133
if you know 15th Street
here in Washington, DC --

00:14:11.157 --> 00:14:14.134
please meet Rahm Emanuel's
new bike lanes in Chicago,

00:14:14.158 --> 00:14:17.536
the buffered lane, the parallel parking
pulled off the curb,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:21.562
the bikes between the parked
cars and the curb --

00:14:21.586 --> 00:14:23.507
these mint cyclists.

00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.082
If, however, as in Pasadena,
every lane is a bike lane,

00:14:27.106 --> 00:14:29.067
then no lane is a bike lane.

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:32.203
And this is the only bicyclist
that I met in Pasadena, so ...

00:14:32.227 --> 00:14:33.832
(Laughter)

00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:35.547
The parallel parking I mentioned --

00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:37.193
it's an essential barrier of steel

00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:41.003
that protects the curb and pedestrians
from moving vehicles.

00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:44.623
This is Ft. Lauderdale;
one side of the street, you can park,

00:14:44.647 --> 00:14:46.599
the other side of the street, you can't.

00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:48.648
This is happy hour on the parking side.

00:14:48.672 --> 00:14:51.363
This is sad hour on the other side.

00:14:51.387 --> 00:14:54.376
And then the trees themselves
slow cars down.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.686
They move slower when trees
are next to the road,

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:59.265
and, of course, sometimes
they slow down very quickly.

00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:02.891
All the little details --
the curb return radius.

00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:04.577
Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?

00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:08.047
How swoopy is that curb to determine
how fast the car goes

00:15:08.071 --> 00:15:09.786
and how much room you have to cross.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.232
And then I love this,
because this is objective journalism.

00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:17.335
"Some say the entrance to CityCenter
is not inviting to pedestrians."

00:15:17.359 --> 00:15:19.817
When every aspect
of the landscape is swoopy,

00:15:19.841 --> 00:15:22.514
is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,

00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:24.855
it says: "This is a vehicular place."

00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:29.954
So no one detail, no one speciality,
can be allowed to set the stage.

00:15:29.978 --> 00:15:31.542
And here, you know, this street:

00:15:31.566 --> 00:15:35.458
yes, it will drain within a minute
of the hundred-year storm,

00:15:35.482 --> 00:15:38.274
but this poor woman
has to mount the curb every day.

00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:41.244
So then quickly, the comfortable walk
has to do with the fact

00:15:41.268 --> 00:15:46.221
that all animals seek, simultaneously,
prospect and refuge.

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.345
We want to be able to see our predators,

00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:50.888
but we also want to feel
that our flanks are covered.

00:15:50.912 --> 00:15:53.403
And so we're drawn to places
that have good edges,

00:15:53.427 --> 00:15:56.755
and if you don't supply the edges,
people won't want to be there.

00:15:56.779 --> 00:15:58.918
What's the proper ratio
of height to width?

00:15:58.942 --> 00:16:00.717
Is it one to one? Three to one?

00:16:00.741 --> 00:16:04.526
If you get beyond one to six,
you're not very comfortable anymore.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.869
You don't feel enclosed.

00:16:05.893 --> 00:16:09.038
Now, six to one in Salzburg
can be perfectly delightful.

00:16:09.062 --> 00:16:11.449
The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.

00:16:12.307 --> 00:16:15.907
The point being the parking lot
is the principal problem here.

00:16:15.931 --> 00:16:19.506
However, missing teeth, those empty lots
can be issues as well,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.775
and if you have a missing corner
because of an outdated zoning code,

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:25.707
then you could have a missing nose
in your neighborhood.

00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.568
That's what we had in my neighborhood.

00:16:27.592 --> 00:16:30.668
This was the zoning code that said
I couldn't build on that site.

00:16:30.692 --> 00:16:34.419
As you may know, Washington, DC
is now changing its zoning

00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:37.573
to allow sites like this
to become sites like this.

00:16:37.597 --> 00:16:39.763
We needed a lot of variances to do that.

00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:42.071
Triangular houses
can be interesting to build,

00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:44.797
but if you get one built,
people generally like it.

00:16:44.821 --> 00:16:47.274
So you've got to fill those missing noses.

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:49.256
And then, finally, the interesting walk:

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.952
signs of humanity.

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.791
We are among the social primates.

00:16:52.815 --> 00:16:55.003
Nothing interests us more
than other people.

00:16:55.027 --> 00:16:56.521
We want signs of people.

00:16:56.545 --> 00:16:59.548
So the perfect one-to-one ratio,
it's a great thing.

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:01.776
This is Grand Rapids,
a very walkable city,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.442
but nobody walks on this street

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:05.577
that connects the two
best hotels together,

00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:09.969
because if on the left,
you have an exposed parking deck,

00:17:09.993 --> 00:17:12.477
and on the right,
you have a conference facility

00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:15.930
that was apparently designed
in admiration for that parking deck,

00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:18.461
then you don't attract that many people.

00:17:18.485 --> 00:17:22.459
Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term,
Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina,

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:24.660
taught us it only takes
25 feet of building

00:17:24.684 --> 00:17:26.978
to hide 250 feet of garage.

00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:29.722
This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.
It's in South Beach.

00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:31.190
That active ground floor.

00:17:31.214 --> 00:17:33.933
I want to end with this project
that I love to show.

00:17:33.957 --> 00:17:36.468
It's by Meleca Architects.
It's in Columbus, Ohio.

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:40.182
To the left is the convention center
neighborhood, full of pedestrians.

00:17:40.206 --> 00:17:42.870
To the right is the Short North
neighborhood -- ethnic,

00:17:42.894 --> 00:17:45.591
great restaurants,
great shops, struggling.

00:17:45.615 --> 00:17:48.169
It wasn't doing very well
because this was the bridge,

00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.660
and no one was walking
from the convention center

00:17:50.684 --> 00:17:52.033
into that neighborhood.

00:17:52.057 --> 00:17:56.350
Well, when they rebuilt the highway,
they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.

00:17:56.374 --> 00:17:58.848
Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge
over the highway.

00:17:58.872 --> 00:18:01.245
The city paid 1.9 million dollars,

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:03.515
they gave the site to a developer,

00:18:03.539 --> 00:18:04.930
the developer built this

00:18:04.954 --> 00:18:07.273
and now the Short North
has come back to life.

00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:10.513
And everyone says, the newspapers,
not the planning magazines,

00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:12.758
the newspapers say
it's because of that bridge.

00:18:12.782 --> 00:18:15.402
So that's it. That's the general
theory of walkability.

00:18:15.426 --> 00:18:17.446
Think about your own cities.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.887
Think about how you can apply it.

00:18:19.911 --> 00:18:21.865
You've got to do all four things at once.

00:18:21.889 --> 00:18:24.198
So find those places
where you have most of them

00:18:24.222 --> 00:18:26.127
and fix what you can,

00:18:26.151 --> 00:18:28.835
fix what still needs fixing
in those places.

00:18:28.859 --> 00:18:30.627
I really appreciate your attention,

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:33.327
and thank you for coming today.

00:18:33.351 --> 00:18:35.899
(Applause)
