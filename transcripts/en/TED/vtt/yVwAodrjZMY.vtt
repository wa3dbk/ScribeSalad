Chris Anderson: The rights of citizens,

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:17.169
the future of the Internet.

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.552
So I would like to welcome to the TED stage

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:23.378
the man behind those revelations,

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:25.754
Ed Snowden.

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.321
(Applause)

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.574
Ed is in a remote location somewhere in Russia

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:36.349
controlling this bot from his laptop,

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:40.402
so he can see what the bot can see.

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.350
Ed, welcome to the TED stage.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.961
What can you see, as a matter of fact?

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.699
Edward Snowden: Ha, I can see everyone.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.949
This is amazing.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.162
(Laughter)

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.445
CA: Ed, some questions for you.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:57.738
You've been called many things

00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.303
in the last few months.

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:04.228
You've been called a whistleblower, a traitor,

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:05.957
a hero.

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:09.774
What words would you describe yourself with?

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:12.436
ES: You know, everybody who is involved

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:13.932
with this debate

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:16.674
has been struggling over me and my personality

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:19.723
and how to describe me.

00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:21.412
But when I think about it,

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:24.841
this isn't the question that
we should be struggling with.

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.008
Who I am really doesn't matter at all.

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.720
If I'm the worst person in the world,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.677
you can hate me and move on.

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.212
What really matters here are the issues.

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:38.047
What really matters here is the
kind of government we want,

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.560
the kind of Internet we want,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.118
the kind of relationship between people

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:43.458
and societies.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.546
And that's what I'm hoping
the debate will move towards,

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:48.918
and we've seen that increasing over time.

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:50.828
If I had to describe myself,

00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:52.172
I wouldn't use words like "hero."

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:54.874
I wouldn't use "patriot," and I wouldn't use "traitor."

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:57.068
I'd say I'm an American and I'm a citizen,

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:59.632
just like everyone else.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:01.505
CA: So just to give some context

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.701
for those who don't know the whole story --

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:07.431
(Applause) —

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.994
this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii

00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:14.384
working as a consultant to the NSA.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.428
As a sysadmin, you had access

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.833
to their systems,

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:23.087
and you began revealing
certain classified documents

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:26.287
to some handpicked journalists

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:27.878
leading the way to June's revelations.

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:33.254
Now, what propelled you to do this?

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:36.040
ES: You know,

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.220
when I was sitting in Hawaii,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.878
and the years before, when I was
working in the intelligence community,

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.600
I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.877
We do a lot of good things
in the intelligence community,

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:49.070
things that need to be done,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.767
and things that help everyone.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.724
But there are also things that go too far.

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:55.020
There are things that shouldn't be done,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.088
and decisions that were being made in secret

00:02:58.088 --> 00:02:59.336
without the public's awareness,

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.848
without the public's consent,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.700
and without even our representatives in government

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.333
having knowledge of these programs.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.866
When I really came to struggle with these issues,

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:14.488
I thought to myself,

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.574
how can I do this in the most responsible way,

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.582
that maximizes the public benefit

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:23.293
while minimizing the risks?

00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:26.381
And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,

00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.623
out of going to Congress,

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:29.926
when there were no laws,

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.611
there were no legal protections

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.378
for a private employee,

00:03:33.378 --> 00:03:36.711
a contractor in intelligence like myself,

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.358
there was a risk that I would be
buried along with the information

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:42.265
and the public would never find out.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:45.287
But the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:48.828
guarantees us a free press for a reason,

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:52.033
and that's to enable an adversarial press,

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.930
to challenge the government,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.564
but also to work together with the government,

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:58.882
to have a dialogue and debate about how we can

00:03:58.882 --> 00:04:04.321
inform the public about matters of vital importance

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:07.451
without putting our national security at risk.

00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.127
And by working with journalists,

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:11.281
by giving all of my information

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.558
back to the American people,

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:15.329
rather than trusting myself to make

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.063
the decisions about publication,

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:20.299
we've had a robust debate

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.566
with a deep investment by the government

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:28.672
that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.

00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:32.447
And the risks that have been threatened,

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.580
the risks that have been played up

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.132
by the government

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:37.558
have never materialized.

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:39.636
We've never seen any evidence

00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:43.192
of even a single instance of specific harm,

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:44.661
and because of that,

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:46.788
I'm comfortable with the decisions that I made.

00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:49.001
CA: So let me show the audience

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.470
a couple of examples of what you revealed.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.382
If we could have a slide up, and Ed,

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:55.137
I don't know whether you can see,

00:04:55.137 --> 00:04:56.251
the slides are here.

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.836
This is a slide of the PRISM program,

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:01.305
and maybe you could tell the audience

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.911
what that was that was revealed.

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:06.123
ES: The best way to understand PRISM,

00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:07.584
because there's been a little bit of controversy,

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:11.335
is to first talk about what PRISM isn't.

00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:14.090
Much of the debate in the U.S.
has been about metadata.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.981
They've said it's just metadata, it's just metadata,

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.722
and they're talking about a specific legal authority

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:22.427
called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.496
That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.859
mass surveillance of the entire country's

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:30.016
phone records, things like that --

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:31.378
who you're talking to,

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.406
when you're talking to them,

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:34.702
where you traveled.

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:37.203
These are all metadata events.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.549
PRISM is about content.

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.689
It's a program through which the government could

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.733
compel corporate America,

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:48.126
it could deputize corporate America

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:51.990
to do its dirty work for the NSA.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.986
And even though some of
these companies did resist,

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:56.409
even though some of them --

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.655
I believe Yahoo was one of them —

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:00.312
challenged them in court, they all lost,

00:06:00.312 --> 00:06:03.227
because it was never tried by an open court.

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:06.358
They were only tried by a secret court.

00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:07.725
And something that we've seen,

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.429
something about the PRISM program
that's very concerning to me is,

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.408
there's been a talking point in the U.S. government

00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:16.159
where they've said 15 federal judges

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.857
have reviewed these programs
and found them to be lawful,

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.577
but what they don't tell you

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:24.207
is those are secret judges

00:06:24.207 --> 00:06:26.209
in a secret court

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:29.283
based on secret interpretations of law

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:33.517
that's considered 34,000 warrant requests

00:06:33.517 --> 00:06:35.976
over 33 years,

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:38.163
and in 33 years only rejected

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:41.046
11 government requests.

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:43.793
These aren't the people that we want deciding

00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:45.939
what the role of corporate America

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.395
in a free and open Internet should be.

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:50.506
CA: Now, this slide that we're showing here

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:52.718
shows the dates in which

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:55.133
different technology companies, Internet companies,

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.487
are alleged to have joined the program,

00:06:57.487 --> 00:07:00.445
and where data collection began from them.

00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:05.194
Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:10.298
How was that data collected by the NSA?

00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:13.477
ES: Right. So the NSA's own slides

00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:16.277
refer to it as direct access.

00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:19.027
What that means to an actual NSA analyst,

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:22.135
someone like me who was working
as an intelligence analyst

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:24.606
targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.688
things like that, in Hawaii,

00:07:26.688 --> 00:07:28.657
is the provenance of that data

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.913
is directly from their servers.

00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:32.977
It doesn't mean

00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:35.783
that there's a group of company representatives

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:38.220
sitting in a smoky room with the NSA

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.010
palling around and making back-room deals

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.553
about how they're going to give this stuff away.

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:44.946
Now each company handles it different ways.

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:46.122
Some are responsible.

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:48.213
Some are somewhat less responsible.

00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:49.981
But the bottom line is, when we talk about

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:53.360
how this information is given,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.846
it's coming from the companies themselves.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:58.141
It's not stolen from the lines.

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.073
But there's an important thing to remember here:

00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:02.004
even though companies pushed back,

00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:04.057
even though companies demanded,

00:08:04.057 --> 00:08:06.603
hey, let's do this through a warrant process,

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.377
let's do this

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:11.526
where we actually have some sort of legal review,

00:08:11.526 --> 00:08:13.357
some sort of basis for handing over

00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:15.297
these users' data,

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:17.688
we saw stories in the Washington Post last year

00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:20.900
that weren't as well reported as the PRISM story

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.499
that said the NSA broke in

00:08:23.499 --> 00:08:25.300
to the data center communications

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.456
between Google to itself

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:29.034
and Yahoo to itself.

00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:31.866
So even these companies that are cooperating

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.737
in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner

00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:36.610
with the NSA,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.906
the NSA isn't satisfied with that,

00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.884
and because of that, we need our companies

00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:44.699
to work very hard

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:47.171
to guarantee that they're going to represent

00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.757
the interests of the user, and also advocate

00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:51.673
for the rights of the users.

00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:52.947
And I think over the last year,

00:08:52.947 --> 00:08:54.530
we've seen the companies that are named

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.948
on the PRISM slides

00:08:55.948 --> 00:08:57.757
take great strides to do that,

00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:00.010
and I encourage them to continue.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.692
CA: What more should they do?

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:06.209
ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:09.435
in America can do today, right now,

00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:10.877
without consulting with lawyers,

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:14.416
to protect the rights of users worldwide,

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:19.799
is to enable SSL web encryption

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.804
on every page you visit.

00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:24.746
The reason this matters is today,

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:29.984
if you go to look at a copy of "1984" on Amazon.com,

00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:32.431
the NSA can see a record of that,

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.650
the Russian intelligence service
can see a record of that,

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.107
the Chinese service can see a record of that,

00:09:37.107 --> 00:09:39.005
the French service, the German service,

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:40.327
the services of Andorra.

00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:43.605
They can all see it because it's unencrypted.

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:47.205
The world's library is Amazon.com,

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:49.860
but not only do they not
support encryption by default,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.026
you cannot choose to use encryption

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.753
when browsing through books.

00:09:53.753 --> 00:09:55.462
This is something that we need to change,

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.337
not just for Amazon, I don't mean to single them out,

00:09:57.337 --> 00:09:58.829
but they're a great example.

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.497
All companies need to move

00:10:00.497 --> 00:10:03.890
to an encrypted browsing habit by default

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.374
for all users who haven't taken any action

00:10:06.374 --> 00:10:08.635
or picked any special methods on their own.

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:10.946
That'll increase the privacy and the rights

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:13.711
that people enjoy worldwide.

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.189
CA: Ed, come with me to this part of the stage.

00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:19.142
I want to show you the next slide here. (Applause)

00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:21.850
This is a program called Boundless Informant.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.526
What is that?

00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:25.706
ES: So, I've got to give credit to the NSA

00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:28.149
for using appropriate names on this.

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:31.994
This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.

00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:33.464
Boundless Informant

00:10:33.464 --> 00:10:36.314
is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:38.723
The NSA was previously asked by Congress,

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:40.936
was there any ability that they had

00:10:40.936 --> 00:10:44.694
to even give a rough ballpark estimate

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.880
of the amount of American communications

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.014
that were being intercepted.

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:52.045
They said no. They said, we don't track those stats,

00:10:52.045 --> 00:10:53.594
and we can't track those stats.

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:56.698
We can't tell you how many communications

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.161
we're intercepting around the world,

00:10:58.161 --> 00:10:59.648
because to tell you that would be

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:02.955
to invade your privacy.

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:05.170
Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.305
but the reality, when you look at this slide is,

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:08.958
not only do they have the capability,

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.574
the capability already exists.

00:11:11.574 --> 00:11:13.248
It's already in place.

00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:16.396
The NSA has its own internal data format

00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:20.545
that tracks both ends of a communication,

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:21.827
and if it says,

00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:23.853
this communication came from America,

00:11:23.853 --> 00:11:26.209
they can tell Congress how
many of those communications

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:28.725
they have today, right now.

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:31.696
And what Boundless Informant tells us

00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:34.422
is more communications are being intercepted

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:37.395
in America about Americans

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:40.815
than there are in Russia about Russians.

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:42.680
I'm not sure that's what an intelligence agency

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.999
should be aiming for.

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.405
CA: Ed, there was a story broken
in the Washington Post,

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:49.127
again from your data.

00:11:49.127 --> 00:11:50.806
The headline says,

00:11:50.806 --> 00:11:52.303
"NSA broke privacy rules

00:11:52.303 --> 00:11:54.333
thousands of times per year."

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:55.871
Tell us about that.

00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.464
ES: We also heard in Congressional
testimony last year,

00:11:58.464 --> 00:12:00.401
it was an amazing thing for someone like me

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:02.105
who came from the NSA

00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:04.677
and who's seen the actual internal documents,

00:12:04.677 --> 00:12:07.268
knows what's in them,

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.808
to see officials testifying under oath

00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:11.690
that there had been no abuses,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.323
that there had been no violations of the NSA's rules,

00:12:15.323 --> 00:12:18.264
when we knew this story was coming.

00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:20.352
But what's especially interesting about this,

00:12:20.352 --> 00:12:22.400
about the fact that the NSA has violated

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.768
their own rules, their own laws

00:12:24.768 --> 00:12:27.441
thousands of times in a single year,

00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:30.168
including one event by itself,

00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:35.144
one event out of those 2,776,

00:12:35.144 --> 00:12:37.450
that affected more than 3,000 people.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.289
In another event, they intercepted

00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:43.501
all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.738
What's amazing about this,

00:12:45.738 --> 00:12:47.946
this report, that didn't get that much attention,

00:12:47.946 --> 00:12:52.807
is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,

00:12:52.807 --> 00:12:54.948
the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,

00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:58.935
Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report

00:12:58.935 --> 00:13:02.126
until the Washington Post contacted her

00:13:02.126 --> 00:13:04.574
asking for comment on the report.

00:13:04.574 --> 00:13:06.467
And she then requested a copy from the NSA

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:08.168
and received it,

00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:10.195
but had never seen this before that.

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:12.882
What does that say about the state of oversight

00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:14.619
in American intelligence

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:16.407
when the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee

00:13:16.407 --> 00:13:19.200
has no idea that the rules are being broken

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.360
thousands of times every year?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.989
CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:

00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:27.654
Why should we care about

00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:29.122
all this surveillance, honestly?

00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:31.274
I mean, look, if you've done nothing wrong,

00:13:31.274 --> 00:13:34.058
you've got nothing to worry about.

00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:36.350
What's wrong with that point of view?

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.998
ES: Well, so the first thing is,

00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:39.711
you're giving up your rights.

00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:41.069
You're saying hey, you know,

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:43.441
I don't think I'm going to need them,

00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:45.123
so I'm just going to trust that, you know,

00:13:45.123 --> 00:13:48.101
let's get rid of them, it doesn't really matter,

00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:50.075
these guys are going to do the right thing.

00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:51.934
Your rights matter

00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:54.776
because you never know when
you're going to need them.

00:13:54.776 --> 00:13:57.058
Beyond that, it's a part of our cultural identity,

00:13:57.058 --> 00:13:59.190
not just in America,

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.781
but in Western societies

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:03.743
and in democratic societies around the world.

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:06.147
People should be able to pick up the phone

00:14:06.147 --> 00:14:07.601
and to call their family,

00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.600
people should be able to send a text message

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.728
to their loved ones,

00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:13.182
people should be able to buy a book online,

00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:14.972
they should be able to travel by train,

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:17.189
they should be able to buy an airline ticket

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.926
without wondering about how these events

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:22.611
are going to look to an agent of the government,

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.201
possibly not even your government

00:14:25.201 --> 00:14:26.956
years in the future,

00:14:26.956 --> 00:14:28.696
how they're going to be misinterpreted

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:31.480
and what they're going to think your intentions were.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.554
We have a right to privacy.

00:14:33.554 --> 00:14:37.172
We require warrants to be based on probable cause

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.636
or some kind of individualized suspicion

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:44.163
because we recognize that trusting anybody,

00:14:44.163 --> 00:14:45.757
any government authority,

00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:48.841
with the entirety of human communications

00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:51.274
in secret and without oversight

00:14:51.274 --> 00:14:56.118
is simply too great a temptation to be ignored.

00:14:56.118 --> 00:14:58.677
CA: Some people are furious at what you've done.

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:01.516
I heard a quote recently from Dick Cheney

00:15:01.516 --> 00:15:07.408
who said that Julian Assange was a flea bite,

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:10.830
Edward Snowden is the lion
that bit the head off the dog.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.383
He thinks you've committed

00:15:12.383 --> 00:15:14.675
one of the worst acts of betrayal

00:15:14.675 --> 00:15:16.781
in American history.

00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:21.137
What would you say to people who think that?

00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:25.180
ES: Dick Cheney's really something else.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:31.977
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:15:32.476 --> 00:15:37.378
Thank you. (Laughter)

00:15:37.378 --> 00:15:39.854
I think it's amazing, because at the time

00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:43.629
Julian Assange was doing some of his greatest work,

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.065
Dick Cheney was saying

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:47.495
he was going to end governments worldwide,

00:15:47.495 --> 00:15:50.400
the skies were going to ignite

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.536
and the seas were going to boil off,

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.754
and now he's saying it's a flea bite.

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:57.267
So we should be suspicious about the same sort of

00:15:57.267 --> 00:16:01.460
overblown claims of damage to national security

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.145
from these kind of officials.

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:09.994
But let's assume that these
people really believe this.

00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:12.224
I would argue that they have kind of

00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:16.594
a narrow conception of national security.

00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.810
The prerogatives of people like Dick Cheney

00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:22.822
do not keep the nation safe.

00:16:22.822 --> 00:16:26.855
The public interest is not always the same

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:29.290
as the national interest.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.184
Going to war with people who are not our enemy

00:16:33.184 --> 00:16:35.314
in places that are not a threat

00:16:35.314 --> 00:16:37.481
doesn't make us safe,

00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:39.648
and that applies whether it's in Iraq

00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:41.415
or on the Internet.

00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:42.938
The Internet is not the enemy.

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:44.963
Our economy is not the enemy.

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:47.249
American businesses, Chinese businesses,

00:16:47.249 --> 00:16:51.820
and any other company out there

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.251
is a part of our society.

00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:56.465
It's a part of our interconnected world.

00:16:56.465 --> 00:17:00.910
There are ties of fraternity that bond us together,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.578
and if we destroy these bonds

00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:06.733
by undermining the standards, the security,

00:17:06.733 --> 00:17:09.590
the manner of behavior,

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.541
that nations and citizens all around the world

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.918
expect us to abide by.

00:17:14.918 --> 00:17:18.620
CA: But it's alleged that you've stolen

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.519
1.7 million documents.

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.346
It seems only a few hundred of them

00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:25.203
have been shared with journalists so far.

00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:28.248
Are there more revelations to come?

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.690
ES: There are absolutely more revelations to come.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.491
I don't think there's any question

00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:37.738
that some of the most important reporting

00:17:37.738 --> 00:17:42.478
to be done is yet to come.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.540
CA: Come here, because I want to ask you

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.067
about this particular revelation.

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:49.089
Come and take a look at this.

00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:52.337
I mean, this is a story which I think
for a lot of the techies in this room

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:54.076
is the single most shocking thing

00:17:54.076 --> 00:17:56.436
that they have heard in the last few months.

00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:59.061
It's about a program called "Bullrun."

00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:02.837
Can you explain what that is?

00:18:02.837 --> 00:18:04.545
ES: So Bullrun, and this is again

00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:11.642
where we've got to thank the NSA for their candor,

00:18:11.642 --> 00:18:16.232
this is a program named after a Civil War battle.

00:18:16.232 --> 00:18:17.845
The British counterpart is called Edgehill,

00:18:17.845 --> 00:18:19.320
which is a U.K. civil war battle.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.527
And the reason that I believe they're named this way

00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:25.016
is because they target our own infrastructure.

00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.707
They're programs through which the NSA

00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:31.922
intentionally misleads corporate partners.

00:18:31.922 --> 00:18:33.804
They tell corporate partners that these

00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:35.479
are safe standards.

00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.498
They say hey, we need to work with you

00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:41.151
to secure your systems,

00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:44.344
but in reality, they're giving bad advice

00:18:44.344 --> 00:18:45.610
to these companies that makes them

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.905
degrade the security of their services.

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.234
They're building in backdoors that not only

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.592
the NSA can exploit,

00:18:52.592 --> 00:18:55.113
but anyone else who has time and money

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:57.233
to research and find it

00:18:57.233 --> 00:18:59.367
can then use to let themselves in

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:01.237
to the world's communications.

00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:03.007
And this is really dangerous,

00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:07.191
because if we lose a single standard,

00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:10.250
if we lose the trust of something like SSL,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.732
which was specifically targeted

00:19:11.732 --> 00:19:13.855
by the Bullrun program,

00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:16.523
we will live a less safe world overall.

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.630
We won't be able to access our banks

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.883
and we won't be able to access commerce

00:19:23.883 --> 00:19:26.706
without worrying about people
monitoring those communications

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:28.884
or subverting them for their own ends.

00:19:28.884 --> 00:19:32.953
CA: And do those same decisions also potentially

00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:35.939
open America up to cyberattacks

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:39.855
from other sources?

00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.320
ES: Absolutely.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.052
One of the problems,

00:19:43.052 --> 00:19:46.502
one of the dangerous legacies

00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:49.994
that we've seen in the post-9/11 era,

00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:54.231
is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.

00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:56.157
They've been in charge of offensive operations,

00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:57.278
that is hacking,

00:19:57.278 --> 00:19:59.988
but they've also been in
charge of defensive operations,

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:02.351
and traditionally they've always prioritized

00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:03.738
defense over offense

00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:05.128
based on the principle

00:20:05.128 --> 00:20:07.944
that American secrets are simply worth more.

00:20:07.944 --> 00:20:10.054
If we hack a Chinese business

00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:11.738
and steal their secrets,

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:13.821
if we hack a government office in Berlin

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:15.919
and steal their secrets,

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:19.526
that has less value to the American people

00:20:19.526 --> 00:20:21.626
than making sure that the Chinese

00:20:21.626 --> 00:20:24.132
can't get access to our secrets.

00:20:24.132 --> 00:20:28.263
So by reducing the security of our communications,

00:20:28.263 --> 00:20:30.291
they're not only putting the world at risk,

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.563
they're putting America at risk in a fundamental way,

00:20:32.563 --> 00:20:35.234
because intellectual property is the basis,

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.161
the foundation of our economy,

00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.419
and if we put that at risk through weak security,

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.048
we're going to be paying for it for years.

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.595
CA: But they've made a calculation

00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:44.786
that it was worth doing this

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:48.325
as part of America's defense against terrorism.

00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:51.937
Surely that makes it a price worth paying.

00:20:51.937 --> 00:20:55.824
ES: Well, when you look at the results

00:20:55.824 --> 00:20:58.131
of these programs in stopping terrorism,

00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:01.881
you will see that that's unfounded,

00:21:01.881 --> 00:21:03.800
and you don't have to take my word for it,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.572
because we've had the first open court,

00:21:07.572 --> 00:21:09.941
the first federal court that's reviewed this,

00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:12.737
outside the secrecy arrangement,

00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:14.724
called these programs Orwellian

00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.958
and likely unconstitutional.

00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.697
Congress, who has access

00:21:19.697 --> 00:21:21.008
to be briefed on these things,

00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:23.990
and now has the desire to be,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.397
has produced bills to reform it,

00:21:26.397 --> 00:21:29.282
and two independent White House panels

00:21:29.282 --> 00:21:31.372
who reviewed all of the classified evidence

00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:34.005
said these programs have never stopped

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.766
a single terrorist attack

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:39.269
that was imminent in the United States.

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:42.455
So is it really terrorism that we're stopping?

00:21:42.455 --> 00:21:44.786
Do these programs have any value at all?

00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:47.030
I say no, and all three branches

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.462
of the American government say no as well.

00:21:49.462 --> 00:21:51.275
CA: I mean, do you think there's a deeper motivation

00:21:51.275 --> 00:21:54.560
for them than the war against terrorism?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.110
ES: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you, say again?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.110
CA: Sorry. Do you think there's a deeper motivation

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.989
for them other than the war against terrorism?

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.684
ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism

00:22:05.684 --> 00:22:07.885
has always been what we in the intelligence world

00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:11.158
would call a cover for action.

00:22:11.158 --> 00:22:13.083
Terrorism is something that provokes

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.313
an emotional response that allows people

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:19.670
to rationalize authorizing powers and programs

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.114
that they wouldn't give otherwise.

00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:24.600
The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.317
the NSA asked for these authorities

00:22:26.317 --> 00:22:28.254
back in the 1990s.

00:22:28.254 --> 00:22:31.244
They asked the FBI to go to
Congress and make the case.

00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:33.418
The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.983
But Congress and the American people said no.

00:22:35.983 --> 00:22:38.394
They said, it's not worth the risk to our economy.

00:22:38.394 --> 00:22:40.313
They said it's worth too much damage

00:22:40.313 --> 00:22:43.000
to our society to justify the gains.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.275
But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:50.526
they used secrecy and they
used the justification of terrorism

00:22:50.526 --> 00:22:52.460
to start these programs in secret

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.272
without asking Congress,

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:56.452
without asking the American people,

00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:59.190
and it's that kind of government behind closed doors

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.749
that we need to guard ourselves against,

00:23:01.749 --> 00:23:02.999
because it makes us less safe,

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:04.891
and it offers no value.

00:23:04.891 --> 00:23:06.757
CA: Okay, come with me here for a sec,

00:23:06.757 --> 00:23:08.939
because I've got a more personal question for you.

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:11.863
Speaking of terror,

00:23:11.863 --> 00:23:15.820
most people would find the
situation you're in right now

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.116
in Russia pretty terrifying.

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:22.703
You obviously heard what happened,

00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:24.896
what the treatment that Bradley Manning got,

00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:27.177
Chelsea Manning as now is,

00:23:27.177 --> 00:23:29.664
and there was a story in Buzzfeed saying that

00:23:29.664 --> 00:23:31.322
there are people in the intelligence community

00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:33.601
who want you dead.

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:35.541
How are you coping with this?

00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.490
How are you coping with the fear?

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.494
ES: It's no mystery

00:23:40.494 --> 00:23:46.142
that there are governments out
there that want to see me dead.

00:23:46.142 --> 00:23:49.552
I've made clear again and again and again

00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:52.918
that I go to sleep every morning

00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:57.478
thinking about what I can
do for the American people.

00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.510
I don't want to harm my government.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.773
I want to help my government,

00:24:03.773 --> 00:24:07.581
but the fact that they are willing to

00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.901
completely ignore due process,

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:12.609
they're willing to declare guilt

00:24:12.609 --> 00:24:15.895
without ever seeing a trial,

00:24:15.895 --> 00:24:18.311
these are things that we need to work against

00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:21.889
as a society, and say hey, this is not appropriate.

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:23.716
We shouldn't be threatening dissidents.

00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:26.730
We shouldn't be criminalizing journalism.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.049
And whatever part I can do to see that end,

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:33.202
I'm happy to do despite the risks.

00:24:33.202 --> 00:24:34.726
CA: So I'd actually like to get some feedback

00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:35.945
from the audience here,

00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:38.049
because I know there's widely differing reactions

00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:39.990
to Edward Snowden.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.278
Suppose you had the following two choices, right?

00:24:42.278 --> 00:24:45.084
You could view what he did

00:24:45.084 --> 00:24:46.978
as fundamentally a reckless act

00:24:46.978 --> 00:24:50.197
that has endangered America

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:53.760
or you could view it as fundamentally a heroic act

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.235
that will work towards America and the world's

00:24:57.235 --> 00:24:58.622
long-term good?

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:01.940
Those are the two choices I'll give you.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.095
I'm curious to see who's willing to vote with

00:25:04.095 --> 00:25:05.512
the first of those,

00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:08.921
that this was a reckless act?

00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:10.576
There are some hands going up.

00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:11.960
Some hands going up.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.236
It's hard to put your hand up

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:15.347
when the man is standing right here,

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.912
but I see them.

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:19.443
ES: I can see you. (Laughter)

00:25:19.443 --> 00:25:21.704
CA: And who goes with the second choice,

00:25:21.704 --> 00:25:23.587
the fundamentally heroic act?

00:25:23.587 --> 00:25:26.234
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:28.808
And I think it's true to say that
there are a lot of people

00:25:28.808 --> 00:25:31.033
who didn't show a hand and I think

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.743
are still thinking this through,

00:25:32.743 --> 00:25:36.201
because it seems to me that the debate around you

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.310
doesn't split along traditional political lines.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.564
It's not left or right, it's not really about

00:25:41.564 --> 00:25:45.686
pro-government, libertarian, or not just that.

00:25:45.686 --> 00:25:48.399
Part of it is almost a generational issue.

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:50.207
You're part of a generation that grew up

00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:53.133
with the Internet, and it seems as if

00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:56.341
you become offended at almost a visceral level

00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:57.637
when you see something done

00:25:57.637 --> 00:25:59.699
that you think will harm the Internet.

00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:03.272
Is there some truth to that?

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:08.320
ES: It is. I think it's very true.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.418
This is not a left or right issue.

00:26:11.418 --> 00:26:13.995
Our basic freedoms, and when I say our,

00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:15.542
I don't just mean Americans,

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:17.555
I mean people around the world,

00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:19.901
it's not a partisan issue.

00:26:19.901 --> 00:26:21.940
These are things that all people believe,

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.465
and it's up to all of us to protect them,

00:26:24.465 --> 00:26:27.297
and to people who have seen and enjoyed

00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:28.958
a free and open Internet,

00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:32.184
it's up to us to preserve that liberty

00:26:32.184 --> 00:26:34.089
for the next generation to enjoy,

00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:35.954
and if we don't change things,

00:26:35.954 --> 00:26:39.087
if we don't stand up to make the changes

00:26:39.087 --> 00:26:42.294
we need to do to keep the Internet safe,

00:26:42.294 --> 00:26:45.062
not just for us but for everyone,

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:46.527
we're going to lose that,

00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:47.780
and that would be a tremendous loss,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.127
not just for us, but for the world.

00:26:50.127 --> 00:26:52.200
CA: Well, I have heard similar language recently

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.048
from the founder of the world wide web,

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:58.565
who I actually think is with us, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:01.269
Tim, actually, would you like to come up and say,

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:03.140
do we have a microphone for Tim?

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.507
(Applause)

00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:12.582
Tim, good to see you. Come up there.

00:27:12.582 --> 00:27:15.019
Which camp are you in, by the way,

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:18.519
traitor, hero? I have a theory on this, but --

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:21.213
Tim Berners-Lee: I've given much longer

00:27:21.213 --> 00:27:24.268
answers to that question, but hero,

00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.670
if I have to make the choice between the two.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.003
CA: And Ed, I think you've read

00:27:31.003 --> 00:27:33.087
the proposal that Sir Tim has talked about

00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:36.055
about a new Magna Carta to take back the Internet.

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:38.157
Is that something that makes sense?

00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:41.798
ES: Absolutely. I mean, my generation, I grew up

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.857
not just thinking about the Internet,

00:27:43.857 --> 00:27:46.221
but I grew up in the Internet,

00:27:46.221 --> 00:27:50.881
and although I never expected to have the chance

00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:56.428
to defend it in such a direct and practical manner

00:27:56.428 --> 00:28:00.224
and to embody it in this unusual,

00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:02.353
almost avatar manner,

00:28:02.353 --> 00:28:05.059
I think there's something poetic about the fact that

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:07.041
one of the sons of the Internet

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:10.093
has actually become close to the Internet

00:28:10.093 --> 00:28:12.579
as a result of their political expression.

00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:16.290
And I believe that a Magna Carta for the Internet

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.252
is exactly what we need.

00:28:18.252 --> 00:28:21.760
We need to encode our values

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.107
not just in writing but in the structure of the Internet,

00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:27.347
and it's something that I hope,

00:28:27.347 --> 00:28:29.870
I invite everyone in the audience,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.120
not just here in Vancouver but around the world,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.476
to join and participate in.

00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:37.790
CA: Do you have a question for Ed?

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.820
TBL: Well, two questions,

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.944
a general question —

00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:42.739
CA: Ed, can you still hear us?

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:46.255
ES: Yes, I can hear you.
CA: Oh, he's back.

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:47.850
TBL: The wiretap on your line

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.756
got a little interfered with for a moment.

00:28:49.756 --> 00:28:51.409
(Laughter)

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:53.611
ES: It's a little bit of an NSA problem.

00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:57.418
TBL: So, from the 25 years,

00:28:57.418 --> 00:29:00.355
stepping back and thinking,

00:29:00.355 --> 00:29:02.101
what would you think would be

00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:04.708
the best that we could achieve

00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:06.568
from all the discussions that we have

00:29:06.568 --> 00:29:09.461
about the web we want?

00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:12.833
ES: When we think about

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:15.946
in terms of how far we can go,

00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:18.099
I think that's a question that's really only limited

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:20.636
by what we're willing to put into it.

00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:23.593
I think the Internet that we've enjoyed in the past

00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:29.151
has been exactly what we as not just a nation

00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:32.490
but as a people around the world need,

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.716
and by cooperating, by engaging not just

00:29:36.716 --> 00:29:38.120
the technical parts of society,

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.962
but as you said, the users,

00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:43.026
the people around the world who contribute

00:29:43.026 --> 00:29:45.468
through the Internet, through social media,

00:29:45.468 --> 00:29:47.195
who just check the weather,

00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:49.748
who rely on it every day as a part of their life,

00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:52.688
to champion that.

00:29:52.688 --> 00:29:55.225
We'll get not just the Internet we've had,

00:29:55.225 --> 00:29:58.174
but a better Internet, a better now,

00:29:58.174 --> 00:30:02.217
something that we can use to build a future

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:05.185
that'll be better not just than what we hoped for

00:30:05.185 --> 00:30:07.570
but anything that we could have imagined.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:13.032
CA: It's 30 years ago that TED was founded, 1984.

00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:15.037
A lot of the conversation since then has been

00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:17.091
along the lines that

00:30:17.091 --> 00:30:18.994
actually George Orwell got it wrong.

00:30:18.994 --> 00:30:20.713
It's not Big Brother watching us.

00:30:20.713 --> 00:30:22.327
We, through the power of the web,

00:30:22.327 --> 00:30:24.691
and transparency, are now watching Big Brother.

00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:26.952
Your revelations kind of drove a stake

00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:30.699
through the heart of that rather optimistic view,

00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:34.119
but you still believe there's a way of doing something

00:30:34.119 --> 00:30:35.988
about that.

00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:37.728
And you do too.

00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:43.896
ES: Right, so there is an argument to be made

00:30:43.896 --> 00:30:47.493
that the powers of Big Brother
have increased enormously.

00:30:47.493 --> 00:30:51.822
There was a recent legal article at Yale

00:30:51.822 --> 00:30:55.553
that established something called
the Bankston-Soltani Principle,

00:30:55.553 --> 00:31:00.782
which is that our expectation of privacy is violated

00:31:00.782 --> 00:31:02.651
when the capabilities of government surveillance

00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.846
have become cheaper by an order of magnitude,

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:08.568
and each time that occurs, we need to revisit

00:31:08.568 --> 00:31:11.621
and rebalance our privacy rights.

00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:13.611
Now, that hasn't happened since

00:31:13.611 --> 00:31:15.709
the government's surveillance powers

00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:18.489
have increased by several orders of magnitude,

00:31:18.489 --> 00:31:21.463
and that's why we're in the
problem that we're in today,

00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:25.275
but there is still hope,

00:31:25.275 --> 00:31:27.411
because the power of individuals

00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:30.018
have also been increased by technology.

00:31:30.018 --> 00:31:32.019
I am living proof

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.181
that an individual can go head to head

00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:36.499
against the most powerful adversaries

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.820
and the most powerful intelligence agencies

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.580
around the world and win,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.240
and I think that's something

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.663
that we need to take hope from,

00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:47.840
and we need to build on

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.277
to make it accessible not just to technical experts

00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:52.794
but to ordinary citizens around the world.

00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:54.461
Journalism is not a crime,

00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:56.251
communication is not a crime,

00:31:56.251 --> 00:31:59.195
and we should not be monitored
in our everyday activities.

00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:01.924
CA: I'm not quite sure how
you shake the hand of a bot,

00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:07.814
but I imagine it's, this is the hand right here.
TBL: That'll come very soon.

00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:08.937
ES: Nice to meet you,

00:32:08.937 --> 00:32:10.984
and I hope my beam looks as nice

00:32:10.984 --> 00:32:13.328
as my view of you guys does.

00:32:13.328 --> 00:32:16.048
CA: Thank you, Tim.

00:32:16.048 --> 00:32:21.780
(Applause)

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.832
I mean, The New York Times
recently called for an amnesty for you.

00:32:25.832 --> 00:32:30.058
Would you welcome the chance
to come back to America?

00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:33.943
ES: Absolutely. There's really no question,

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:36.525
the principles that have been the foundation

00:32:36.525 --> 00:32:38.918
of this project

00:32:38.918 --> 00:32:42.998
have been the public interest

00:32:42.998 --> 00:32:45.941
and the principles that underly

00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:49.217
the journalistic establishment in the United States

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.663
and around the world,

00:32:51.663 --> 00:32:56.508
and I think if the press is now saying,

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.590
we support this,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.678
this is something that needed to happen,

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:03.322
that's a powerful argument,
but it's not the final argument,

00:33:03.322 --> 00:33:06.035
and I think that's something
that public should decide.

00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.877
But at the same time,

00:33:07.877 --> 00:33:09.423
the government has hinted that they want

00:33:09.423 --> 00:33:11.267
some kind of deal,

00:33:11.267 --> 00:33:13.381
that they want me to compromise

00:33:13.381 --> 00:33:15.556
the journalists with which I've been working,

00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:16.989
to come back,

00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:19.542
and I want to make it very clear

00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:22.268
that I did not do this to be safe.

00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:24.536
I did this to do what was right,

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:26.763
and I'm not going to stop my work

00:33:26.763 --> 00:33:28.137
in the public interest

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:30.926
just to benefit myself.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:36.704
(Applause)

00:33:36.704 --> 00:33:38.623
CA: In the meantime,

00:33:38.623 --> 00:33:42.391
courtesy of the Internet and this technology,

00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:44.041
you're here, back in North America,

00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:48.057
not quite the U.S., Canada, in this form.

00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:52.951
I'm curious, how does that feel?

00:33:52.951 --> 00:33:55.089
ES: Canada is different than what I expected.

00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:57.214
It's a lot warmer.

00:33:57.214 --> 00:34:02.921
(Laughter)

00:34:02.921 --> 00:34:06.177
CA: At TED, the mission is "ideas worth spreading."

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:08.375
If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,

00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:10.590
what is your idea worth spreading

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.665
right now at this moment?

00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:18.315
ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:21.918
that democracy may die behind closed doors,

00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:23.822
but we as individuals are born

00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:26.471
behind those same closed doors,

00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:28.836
and we don't have to give up

00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:32.069
our privacy to have good government.

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:34.159
We don't have to give up our liberty

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.938
to have security.

00:34:35.938 --> 00:34:38.726
And I think by working together

00:34:38.726 --> 00:34:41.051
we can have both open government

00:34:41.051 --> 00:34:42.988
and private lives,

00:34:42.988 --> 00:34:44.761
and I look forward to working with everyone

00:34:44.761 --> 00:34:47.300
around the world to see that happen.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.638
Thank you very much.

00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:50.878
CA: Ed, thank you.

00:34:50.878 --> 00:34:59.707
(Applause)
