00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.746
Clouds.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.368
Have you ever noticed how much
people moan about them?

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:19.615
They get a bad rap.

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:22.162
If you think about it,
the English language

00:00:22.186 --> 00:00:26.455
has written into it negative
associations towards the clouds.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.922
Someone who's down or depressed,

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:30.613
they're under a cloud.

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:32.304
And when there's bad news in store,

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:35.152
there's a cloud on the horizon.

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:37.184
I saw an article the other day.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:40.370
It was about problems
with computer processing

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.192
over the Internet.

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:47.116
"A cloud over the cloud,"
was the headline.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.099
It seems like they're everyone's default

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:51.373
doom-and-gloom metaphor.

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:53.526
But I think they're beautiful, don't you?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.639
It's just that their beauty is missed

00:00:56.663 --> 00:00:58.639
because they're so omnipresent,

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:01.988
so, I don't know, commonplace,

00:01:02.012 --> 00:01:03.441
that people don't notice them.

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:06.656
They don't notice the beauty,
but they don't even notice the clouds

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.933
unless they get in the way of the sun.

00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:11.238
And so people think of clouds as

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:13.318
things that get in the way.

00:01:13.342 --> 00:01:18.389
They think of them as the annoying,
frustrating obstructions,

00:01:18.413 --> 00:01:21.309
and then they rush off and do
some blue-sky thinking.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.694
(Laughter)

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:25.917
But most people, when
you stop to ask them,

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:30.767
will admit to harboring a strange
sort of fondness for clouds.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.426
It's like a nostalgic fondness,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.560
and they make them think of their youth.

00:01:36.584 --> 00:01:39.796
Who here can't remember thinking, well,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.398
looking and finding shapes in the clouds

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:43.741
when they were kids?

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:50.472
You know, when you were
masters of daydreaming?

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.239
Aristophanes, the ancient
Greek playwright,

00:01:53.263 --> 00:01:56.590
he described the clouds
as the patron godesses

00:01:56.614 --> 00:01:58.374
of idle fellows

00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:00.018
two and a half thousand years ago,

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:01.471
and you can see what he means.

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:05.928
It's just that these days,
us adults seem reluctant

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.288
to allow ourselves the indulgence

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:11.920
of just allowing our imaginations

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:15.590
to drift along in the breeze,
and I think that's a pity.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:17.976
I think we should perhaps
do a bit more of it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.996
I think we should be a bit
more willing, perhaps,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.939
to look at the beautiful sight
of the sunlight bursting out

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:28.405
from behind the clouds
and go, "Wait a minute,

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.744
that's two cats dancing the salsa!"

00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:32.141
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:37.907
Or seeing the big, white,
puffy one up there

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:39.829
over the shopping center looks like

00:02:39.853 --> 00:02:43.462
the Abominable Snowman
going to rob a bank.

00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:46.658
(Laughter)

00:02:46.682 --> 00:02:50.576
They're like nature's version
of those inkblot images,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.981
you know, that shrinks used
to show their patients

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.248
in the '60s,

00:02:54.272 --> 00:02:57.973
and I think if you consider
the shapes you see in the clouds,

00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:01.863
you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.

00:03:01.887 --> 00:03:03.742
Let's say you're in love. All right?

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.939
And you look up and what do you see?

00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:08.565
Right? Or maybe the opposite.

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.609
You've just been dumped by your partner,

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.718
and everywhere you look,
it's kissing couples.

00:03:13.742 --> 00:03:15.670
(Laughter)

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:19.426
Perhaps you're having a moment
of existential angst.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.879
You know, you're thinking
about your own mortality.

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:24.875
And there, on the horizon,
it's the Grim Reaper.

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.834
(Laughter)

00:03:27.858 --> 00:03:31.279
Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:32.908
(Laughter)

00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:35.980
What would that mean?

00:03:36.004 --> 00:03:41.511
What would that mean? I have no idea.

00:03:41.535 --> 00:03:43.741
But one thing I do know is this:

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:47.116
The bad press that clouds
get is totally unfair.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.855
I think we should stand up for them,

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.308
which is why, a few years ago,

00:03:50.332 --> 00:03:52.994
I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.566
Tens of thousands of members now

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.592
in almost 100 countries around the world.

00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.593
And all these photographs
that I'm showing,

00:04:00.617 --> 00:04:02.949
they were sent in by members.

00:04:02.973 --> 00:04:06.413
And the society exists
to remind people of this:

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:09.460
Clouds are not something to moan about.

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:11.843
Far from it. They are, in fact,

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:19.553
the most diverse, evocative,
poetic aspect of nature.

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:22.820
I think, if you live
with your head in the clouds

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:25.797
every now and then, it helps you
keep your feet on the ground.

00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:27.419
And I want to show you
why, with the help of

00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:29.499
some of my favorite types of clouds.

00:04:29.523 --> 00:04:31.857
Let's start with this one.
It's the cirrus cloud,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.776
named after the Latin for a lock of hair.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.397
It's composed entirely of ice crystals

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.913
cascading from the upper
reaches of the troposphere,

00:04:38.937 --> 00:04:40.414
and as these ice crystals fall,

00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:43.058
they pass through different
layers with different winds

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.742
and they speed up and slow down,

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:47.801
giving the cloud these
brush-stroked appearances,

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:50.736
these brush-stroke forms
known as fall streaks.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.747
And these winds up there
can be very, very fierce.

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:55.328
They can be 200 miles
an hour, 300 miles an hour.

00:04:55.352 --> 00:04:56.829
These clouds are bombing along,

00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:58.612
but from all the way down here,

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:01.760
they appear to be moving
gracefully, slowly,

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.969
like most clouds.

00:05:03.993 --> 00:05:07.192
And so to tune into the clouds
is to slow down,

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:09.137
to calm down.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.970
It's like a bit of everyday meditation.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:13.130
Those are common clouds.

00:05:13.154 --> 00:05:15.932
What about rarer ones,
like the lenticularis,

00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:18.283
the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?

00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.803
These clouds form
in the region of mountains.

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:23.688
When the wind passes, rises
to pass over the mountain,

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:26.927
it can take on a wave-like
path in the lee of the peak,

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:29.654
with these clouds hovering at the crest

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.314
of these invisible standing waves of air,

00:05:32.338 --> 00:05:34.576
these flying saucer-like forms,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.240
and some of the early
black-and-white UFO photos

00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:40.156
are in fact lenticularis clouds.
It's true.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.995
A little rarer are the fallstreak holes.
All right?

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.400
This is when a layer is made
up of very, very cold

00:05:46.424 --> 00:05:49.247
water droplets, and in one region
they start to freeze,

00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.414
and this freezing sets off a chain
reaction which spreads outwards

00:05:52.438 --> 00:05:55.118
with the ice crystals cascading
and falling down below,

00:05:55.142 --> 00:05:59.957
giving the appearance
of jellyfish tendrils down below.

00:05:59.981 --> 00:06:04.037
Rarer still, the Kelvin–Helmholtz cloud.

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:07.479
Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.

00:06:07.503 --> 00:06:11.239
This looks like a series
of breaking waves,

00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:13.933
and it's caused by shearing
winds -- the wind

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.196
above the cloud layer
and below the cloud layer

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.751
differ significantly,
and in the middle, in between,

00:06:18.775 --> 00:06:20.634
you get this undulating of the air,

00:06:20.658 --> 00:06:23.135
and if the difference in those
speeds is just right,

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:25.037
the tops of the undulations curl over

00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:28.599
in these beautiful breaking
wave-like vortices.

00:06:28.623 --> 00:06:31.004
All right. Those are rarer
clouds than the cirrus,

00:06:31.028 --> 00:06:32.711
but they're not that rare.

00:06:32.735 --> 00:06:35.559
If you look up, and you
pay attention to the sky,

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:37.432
you'll see them sooner or later,

00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:40.218
maybe not quite as dramatic
as these, but you'll see them.

00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:42.272
And you'll see them around where you live.

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:44.833
Clouds are the most egalitarian

00:06:44.857 --> 00:06:47.507
of nature's displays,
because we all have a good,

00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:50.138
fantastic view of the sky.

00:06:50.162 --> 00:06:51.978
And these clouds, these rarer clouds,

00:06:52.002 --> 00:06:56.698
remind us that the exotic can
be found in the everyday.

00:06:56.722 --> 00:06:59.457
Nothing is more nourishing,
more stimulating

00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.924
to an active, inquiring
mind than being surprised,

00:07:02.948 --> 00:07:06.620
being amazed. It's why we're
all here at TED, right?

00:07:06.644 --> 00:07:09.565
But you don't need to rush off

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.925
away from the familiar, across the world

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.387
to be surprised.

00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:16.162
You just need to step outside,

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.738
pay attention to what's so
commonplace, so everyday,

00:07:18.762 --> 00:07:22.725
so mundane that everybody else misses it.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.139
One cloud that people
rarely miss is this one:

00:07:25.163 --> 00:07:28.107
the cumulonimbus storm cloud.

00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:30.608
It's what's produces thunder
and lightning and hail.

00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:33.716
These clouds spread
out at the top in this enormous

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.538
anvil fashion stretching 10
miles up into the atmosphere.

00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:39.957
They are an expression
of the majestic architecture

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:41.842
of our atmosphere.

00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:45.228
But from down below,
they are the embodiment

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:49.359
of the powerful, elemental force and power

00:07:49.383 --> 00:07:51.253
that drives our atmosphere.

00:07:51.277 --> 00:07:55.367
To be there is to be connected
in the driving rain

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.669
and the hail, to feel
connected to our atmosphere.

00:07:58.693 --> 00:08:00.967
It's to be reminded that we are creatures

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:02.676
that inhabit this ocean of air.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:06.073
We don't live beneath the sky.
We live within it.

00:08:06.097 --> 00:08:10.156
And that connection, that visceral
connection to our atmosphere

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.592
feels to me like an antidote.

00:08:12.616 --> 00:08:15.696
It's an antidote to the growing
tendency we have

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.571
to feel that we can really
ever experience life

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:21.786
by watching it on a computer
screen, you know,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.236
when we're in a wi-fi zone.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.520
But the one cloud that best expresses

00:08:26.544 --> 00:08:29.445
why cloudspotting is more
valuable today than ever

00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:32.636
is this one, the cumulus cloud.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.715
Right? It forms on a sunny day.

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:36.835
If you close your eyes
and think of a cloud,

00:08:36.859 --> 00:08:39.184
it's probably one of these
that comes to mind.

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:41.808
All those cloud shapes at the beginning,

00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:43.951
those were cumulus clouds.

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:47.575
The sharp, crisp outlines
of this formation

00:08:47.599 --> 00:08:50.731
make it the best
one for finding shapes in.

00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:52.703
And it reminds us

00:08:52.727 --> 00:08:56.647
of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,

00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:58.896
what an aimless activity it is.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.635
You're not going to change the world

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:04.687
by lying on your back and gazing
up at the sky, are you?

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.910
It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,

00:09:06.934 --> 00:09:11.766
which is precisely why it's so important.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.795
The digital world
conspires to make us feel

00:09:15.819 --> 00:09:18.566
eternally busy, perpetually busy.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.400
You know, when you're not dealing with

00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:23.078
the traditional pressures
of earning a living

00:09:23.102 --> 00:09:25.732
and putting food on the table,
raising a family,

00:09:25.756 --> 00:09:27.806
writing thank you letters,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.518
you have to now contend with

00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:34.084
answering a mountain of unanswered emails,

00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:35.942
updating a Facebook page,

00:09:35.966 --> 00:09:38.490
feeding your Twitter feed.

00:09:38.514 --> 00:09:42.276
And cloudspotting
legitimizes doing nothing.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.181
(Laughter)

00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:46.833
And sometimes we need —

00:09:46.857 --> 00:09:52.441
(Applause)

00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:56.524
Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.

00:09:56.548 --> 00:09:59.306
We need to be reminded by these

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.838
patron goddesses of idle fellows

00:10:02.862 --> 00:10:05.813
that slowing down

00:10:05.837 --> 00:10:09.616
and being in the present,
not thinking about

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.470
what you've got to do
and what you should have done,

00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:15.205
but just being here,
letting your imagination

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:17.967
lift from the everyday concerns down here

00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:20.799
and just being in the present,
it's good for you,

00:10:20.823 --> 00:10:22.937
and it's good for the way you feel.

00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:26.505
It's good for your ideas.
It's good for your creativity.

00:10:26.529 --> 00:10:29.855
It's good for your soul.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.082
So keep looking up,

00:10:32.106 --> 00:10:35.135
marvel at the ephemeral beauty,

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:38.559
and always remember to live life
with your head in the clouds.

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:39.746
Thank you very much.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.417
(Applause)
