00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Welcome to Thailand.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.260
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.260
the country was very, very poor

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.260
We decided to do something about it,

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
but we didn't begin with a welfare program

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
or a poverty reduction program.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
But we began with a family-planning program,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
following a very successful

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.260
maternal child health activity,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.260
sets of activities.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
So basically, no one would accept family planning

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
if their children didn't survive.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
and then follow up with family planning.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
Now let me take you back

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
as to why we needed to do it.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
In my country, that was the case in 1974.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.260
Seven children per family --

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260
There was just no future.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.260
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
So we said, "Let's do it."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.260
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and we had very, very few doctors.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
We didn't take no as an answer;

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
we took no as a question.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
and did a fantastic job

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
at explaining how to use the pill.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.260
That was wonderful,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.260
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.260
What do we do for the other 80 percent --

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.260
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260
No, we decided to do a bit more.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.260
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.260
Actually, below that yellow sign --

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
I wish they hadn't wiped that,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
because there was "Coca-Cola" there.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
And no difference,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.260
the people they chose were the people we chose.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
They were well-known in the community,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
they knew that customers were always right,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.260
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.260
So they could supply pills and condoms

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.260
throughout the country, in every village of the country.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
So there we are. We went to the people

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
who were seen as the cause of the problem

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
to be the solution.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.260
Wherever there were people --

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
here's the floating market

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
selling bananas and crabs

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
and also contraceptives --

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
wherever you find people,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
And then we decided, why not get to religion

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.260
because in the Philippines,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
the Catholic Church was pretty strong,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
and Thai people were Buddhist.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
holding a bowl of holy water

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
for the monk to sprinkle holy water

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
on pills and condoms

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
for the sanctity of the family.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
And this picture was sent throughout the country.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.260
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
It's been blessed."

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.260
That was their perception.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.260
And then we went to teachers.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.260
You need everybody to be involved

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.260
in trying to provide whatever it is

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.260
that make humanity a better place.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.260
So we went to the teachers.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.260
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260
I for IUD, V for vasectomy.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.260
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Very good, mother. Move ahead.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.260
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.260
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
(Laughter)

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
Again, education, class entertainment.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
And the kids were doing it in school too.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
We had relay races with condoms,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.260
we had children's condom-blowing championship.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.260
And before long,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
so the condom is the girl's best friend.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
and the women who organized it said,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
"We only want to lend

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
to women who practice family planning.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
And that was run by them.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
And after 35/36 years,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
it's still going on.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.260
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.260
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260
it was run by the villagers themselves.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
it's always women, women, women, women.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
And then we thought we'd help America,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
because America's been helping everyone,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
whether they want help or not.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
(Laughter)

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.260
And this is on the Fourth of July.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.260
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.260
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
right up to the Ambassador's residence

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
during his vin d'honneur.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.260
very appropriate room.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.260
(Laughter)

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
And since it was near lunch time,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.260
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260
Of course, it must be American cola.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.260
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.260
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260
(Laughter)

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260
who worked for the USAID.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.260
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.260
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.260
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.260
(Laughter)

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.260
And what happened?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
In all this thing,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.260
from seven children to 1.5 children,

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.260
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.260
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
it was exactly the same thing.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260
but we're good friends.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.260
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.260
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.260
But it's everybody's job

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
who can change attitude and behavior.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.260
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
to fight AIDS.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.260
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.260
So our work wasn't affected.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.260
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.260
So I went to the military

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.260
and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.260
They have more than the government,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.260
and they've got more guns than the government.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.260
So I asked them, could they help us

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
in our fight against HIV.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.260
And after I gave them statistics,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.260
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.260
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.260
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.260
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.260
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So I said, "Okay."

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.260
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.260
and increased the budget fifty-fold.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.260
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
religious institutions, schools --

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.260
everyone was involved.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.260
And here, every media person

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
had to be trained for HIV.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
And we gave every station half a minute extra

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.260
for advertising to earn more money.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
So they were happy with that.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
And then AIDS education in all schools,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
starting from university.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
and they were terrific.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.260
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.260
were known as Mother Theresa.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.260
And then we went down one more step.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.260
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.260
going to every household in the village,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.260
every household in the whole of Thailand,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.260
giving AIDS information and a condom

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
to every household,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.260
given by these young kids.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.260
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.260
and this was a lifesaver.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.260
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.260
So you have the companies also realizing

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
So they all trained.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
And then we have this Captain Condom,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
with his Harvard MBA,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.260
going to schools and night spots.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.260
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.260
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.260
(Laughter)

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
everywhere, everywhere.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
In taxis, you get condoms.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And also, in traffic,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.260
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.260
(Laughter)

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.260
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.260
Imagine if they had condoms,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.260
giving out to all sorts of people.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.260
And then, new change,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.260
we had hair bands, clothing

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.260
and the condom for your mobile phone

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
during the rainy season.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
(Laughter)

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
And these were the condoms that we introduced.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.260
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
We found --

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.260
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.260
And then it says here, with the American flag,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.260
"Don't leave home without it."

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.260
But I have some to give out afterward.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
so be very careful.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
(Laughter)

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
And so you can see

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
that condoms can do so many things.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
Look at this --

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.260
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.260
Stop global warming; use condoms.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.260
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.260
the weapon of mass protection.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.260
And let the next Olympics save some lives.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.260
Why just run around?

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.260
(Laughter)

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.260
And then finally,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.260
(Laughter)

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.260
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
to make life better for the people.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.260
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.260
because alcohol impairs judgment.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.260
And then what happened?

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.260
After all this time, everybody joined in.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.260
According to the U.N.,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.260
new cases of HIV

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.260
declined by 90 percent,

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.260
and according to the World Bank,

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.260
7.7 million lives were saved.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.260
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.260
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.260
There was political commitment, some financial commitment,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
and everybody joined in the fight.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.260
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.260
We all need to help.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And then we decided to help people out of poverty,

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.260
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.260
this time, not with government alone,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
but in cooperation with the business community.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Because poor people are business people

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
who lack business skills and access to credit.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.260
little business people.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.260
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.260
So, that was done.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.260
The money goes from the company into the village

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
via tree-planting.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.260
It's not a free gift.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.260
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
which we call the Village Development Bank.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.260
Everybody joins in,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.260
and they feel they own the bank,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
because they have brought the money in.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.260
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
And we believe if you want to help the poor,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.260
those who are living in poverty,

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.260
access to credit must be a human right.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Access to credit must be a human right.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.260
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.260
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.260
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:39.260
teaching people how to do business

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.260
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.260
These are some of the businesses:

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.260
mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
trees, fruits,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.260
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.260
this is a village sponsored by Nike.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.260
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.260
Make these better, because we can afford them."

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.260
And then we have silk, Thai silk.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.260
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
So anyone sitting in and watching TV,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.260
get in touch with me.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
"Coffee and Condoms."

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.260
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.260
That's the difference.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
that you can also get condoms?

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.260
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.260
And then now, finally in education,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.260
we want to change the school as being underutilized

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.260
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.260
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
And it's a center, a focal point

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
for economic and social development.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
Re-do the school,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
make it serve the community needs.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And here is a bamboo building --

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
all of them are bamboo.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.260
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.260
to see a bamboo geodesic dome.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
And we use vegetables around the school ground,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.260
so they raise their own vegetables.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.260
And then, finally, I firmly believe,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.260
if we want the MDGs to work --

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.260
the Millennium Development Goals --

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
we need to add family planning to it.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.260
everyone needs family planning service --

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.260
it's underutilized.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
And we also ask the next Olympics

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.260
to be involved in saving lives.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.260
And then, finally, that is our network.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.260
And these are our Thai tulips.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.260
(Laughter)

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.260
Thank you very much indeed.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
(Applause)
