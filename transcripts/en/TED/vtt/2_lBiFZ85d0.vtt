00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:14.673
Six months ago, I got an email

00:00:14.673 --> 00:00:16.080
from a man in Israel

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.461
who had read one of my books,

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.964
and the email said,

00:00:18.964 --> 00:00:20.971
"You don't know me,

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.443
but I'm your 12th cousin."

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:25.820
And it said, "I have a family tree

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.724
with 80,000 people on it, including you,

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:30.878
Karl Marx,

00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:33.478
and several European aristocrats."

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:35.880
Now I did not know what to make of this.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.231
Part of me was like, okay,

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.191
when's he going to ask me to wire

00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.888
10,000 dollars to his Nigerian bank, right?

00:00:43.888 --> 00:00:47.561
I also thought, 80,000 relatives,

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:48.854
do I want that?

00:00:48.854 --> 00:00:50.672
I have enough trouble with some of the ones

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:52.109
I have already.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.775
And I won't name names, but you know who you are.

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:59.024
But another part of me said, this is remarkable.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.760
Here I am alone in my office, but I'm not alone at all.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.320
I'm connected to 80,000 people around the world,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.697
and that's four Madison Square Gardens

00:01:08.697 --> 00:01:10.412
full of cousins.

00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:13.349
And some of them are going to be great,

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.679
and some of them are going to be irritating,

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.495
but they're all related to me.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:22.366
So this email inspired me to dive into genealogy,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.766
which I always thought was
a very staid and proper field,

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.691
but it turns out it's going through a fascinating

00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:31.184
revolution, and a controversial one.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:34.950
Partly, this is because of DNA and genetic testing,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.900
but partly, it's because of the Internet.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.660
There are sites that now take

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.827
the Wikipedia approach to family trees,

00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:46.180
collaboration and crowdsourcing,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.358
and what you do is,

00:01:47.358 --> 00:01:50.240
you load your family tree on,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.720
and then these sites search

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.402
to see if the A.J. Jacobs in your tree

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:56.882
is the same as the A.J. Jacobs in another tree,

00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:00.115
and if it is, then you can combine,

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:02.010
and then you combine and combine and combine

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.911
until you get these massive,

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:05.761
mega-family trees

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.262
with thousands of people on them,

00:02:08.262 --> 00:02:09.677
or even millions.

00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:12.004
I'm on something on Geni called

00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:13.930
the world family tree,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.487
which has no less than a jaw-dropping

00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:20.017
75 million people.

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:23.857
So that's 75 million people connected by blood

00:02:23.857 --> 00:02:26.337
or marriage, sometimes both.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:28.904
(Laughter)

00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:33.089
It's in all seven continents, including Antarctica.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.466
I'm on it. Many of you are on it,

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.170
whether you know it or not,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.634
and you can see the links.

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:44.226
Here's my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:46.109
She has no idea I exist,

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.800
but we are officially cousins.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.996
We have just 17 links between us.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:55.689
And there's my cousin Barack Obama.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:56.881
(Laughter)

00:02:56.881 --> 00:03:00.506
And he is my aunt's fifth great-aunt's husband's

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:04.014
father's wife's seventh great-nephew,

00:03:04.014 --> 00:03:09.079
so practically my old brother.

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.602
And my cousin, of course,

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:11.919
the actor Kevin Bacon --

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.571
(Laughter) —

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.535
who is my first cousin's twice removed's

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:18.927
wife's niece's husband's first cousin once removed's

00:03:18.927 --> 00:03:20.137
niece's husband.

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:22.272
So six degrees of Kevin Bacon,

00:03:22.272 --> 00:03:26.391
plus or minus several degrees.

00:03:26.391 --> 00:03:28.772
Now, I'm not boasting, because all of you

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:31.000
have famous people and historical figures

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.667
in your tree, because we are all connected,

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.830
and 75 million may seem like a lot,

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.556
but in a few years, it's quite likely

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:42.069
we will have a family tree

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.820
with all, almost all, seven billion people on Earth.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.613
But does it really matter?

00:03:48.613 --> 00:03:49.955
What's the importance?

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.633
And I do think it is important,

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:54.111
and I'll give you five reasons why, really quickly.

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:56.931
First, it's got scientific value.

00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:00.545
This is an unprecedented history of the human race,

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:03.976
and it's giving us valuable data

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:06.125
about how diseases are inherited,

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:07.993
how people migrate,

00:04:07.993 --> 00:04:10.913
and there's a team of scientists at MIT right now

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:13.593
studying the world family tree.

00:04:13.593 --> 00:04:16.479
Number two, it brings history alive.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.940
I found out I'm connected to Albert Einstein,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.000
so I told my seven-year-old son that,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.846
and he was totally engaged.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.213
Now Albert Einstein is not some dead white guy

00:04:28.213 --> 00:04:29.423
with weird hair.

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:33.580
He's Uncle Albert. (Laughter)

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.140
And my son wanted to know,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.297
"What did he say? What is E = MC squared?"

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.356
Also, it's not all good news.

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:43.343
I found a link to Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killer,

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:45.960
but I will say that's on my wife's side.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.648
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:48.648 --> 00:04:51.243
So I want to make that clear. Sorry, honey.

00:04:51.243 --> 00:04:54.132
Number three, interconnectedness.

00:04:54.132 --> 00:04:57.495
We all come from the same ancestor,

00:04:57.495 --> 00:05:00.063
and you don't have to believe
the literal Bible version,

00:05:00.063 --> 00:05:04.151
but scientists talk about Y chromosomal Adam

00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:07.004
and mitochondrial Eve,

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:10.320
and these were about 100,000 to 300,000 years ago.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.373
We all have a bit of their DNA in us.

00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:16.190
They are our great-great-great-great-great-great --

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.930
continue that for about 7,000 times --

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.745
grandparents,

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:23.391
and so that means we literally all are

00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:25.546
biological cousins as well,

00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:28.102
and estimates vary, but probably

00:05:28.102 --> 00:05:30.804
the farthest cousin you have on Earth

00:05:30.804 --> 00:05:33.259
is about a 50th cousin.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.440
Now, it's not just ancestors we share, descendants.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.140
If you have kids, and they have kids,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.605
look how quickly the descendants accumulate.

00:05:43.605 --> 00:05:45.298
So in 10, 12 generations,

00:05:45.298 --> 00:05:47.429
you're going to have thousands of offspring,

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:48.946
and millions of offspring.

00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:50.935
Number four, a kinder world.

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:53.424
Now, I know that there are family feuds.

00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:55.719
I have three sons, so I see how they fight.

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.385
But I think that there's also a human bias

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:00.911
to treat your family a little better than strangers.

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:04.735
I think this tree is going to be bad news for bigots,

00:06:04.735 --> 00:06:08.160
because they're going to have to realize

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.770
that they are cousins with thousands of people

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.521
in whatever ethnic group they happen

00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:15.783
to have issues with,

00:06:15.783 --> 00:06:17.668
and I think you look back at history,

00:06:17.668 --> 00:06:20.669
and a lot of the terrible things
we've done to each other

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.575
is because one group thinks
another group is sub-human,

00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:25.040
and you can't do that anymore.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.410
We're not just part of the same species.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.177
We're part of the same family.

00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:31.813
We share 99.9 percent of our DNA.

00:06:31.813 --> 00:06:34.114
Now the final one is number five,

00:06:34.114 --> 00:06:35.793
a democratizing effect.

00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:39.250
Some genealogy has an elitist strain,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.240
like people say, "Oh, I'm descended

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.511
from Mary Queen of Scots

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.718
and you're not, so you cannot join my country club."

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:48.659
But that's really going to be hard to do now,

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.090
because everyone is related.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.778
I'm descended from Mary Queen of Scots --

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:56.131
by marriage, but still.

00:06:56.131 --> 00:06:59.627
So it's really a fascinating time

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.183
in the history of family,

00:07:01.183 --> 00:07:04.690
because it's changing so fast.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.265
There is gay marriage and sperm donors

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:12.185
and there's intermarriage
on an unprecedented scale,

00:07:12.185 --> 00:07:14.411
and this makes some of my
more conservative cousins

00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:16.020
a little nervous,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.824
but I actually think it's a good thing.

00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:21.653
I think the more inclusive the idea of family is,

00:07:21.653 --> 00:07:22.680
the better,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.784
because then you have more potential caretakers,

00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:29.099
and as my aunt's eighth cousin twice removed

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:31.226
Hillary Clinton says --

00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:32.970
(Laughter) —

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.299
it takes a village.

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:39.562
So I have all these hundreds and thousands,

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:40.680
millions of new cousins.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.421
I thought, what can I do with this information?

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.277
And that's when I decided,

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:47.516
why not throw a party?

00:07:47.516 --> 00:07:49.752
So that's what I'm doing.

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:52.312
And you're all invited.

00:07:52.312 --> 00:07:54.210
Next year, next summer,

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.141
I will be hosting what I hope is

00:07:56.141 --> 00:08:00.619
the biggest and best family reunion in history.

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:01.651
(Applause)

00:08:01.651 --> 00:08:04.053
Thank you. I want you there.

00:08:04.053 --> 00:08:05.165
I want you there.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:07.639
It's going to be at the New York Hall of Science,

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.921
which is a great venue,

00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.701
but it's also on the site of the former World's Fair,

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:17.346
which is, I think, very appropriate,

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:19.576
because I see this as a family reunion

00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:20.994
meets a world's fair.

00:08:20.994 --> 00:08:23.935
There's going to be exhibits and food, music.

00:08:23.935 --> 00:08:26.244
Paul McCartney is 11 steps away,

00:08:26.244 --> 00:08:29.844
so I'm hoping he brings his guitar.

00:08:29.844 --> 00:08:32.579
He hasn't RSVP'd yet, but fingers crossed.

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:34.970
And there is going to be a day of speakers,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.971
of fascinating cousins.

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:38.153
It's early, but I've already,

00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:40.025
I've got some lined up.

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:42.749
Cass Sunstein, my cousin who is perhaps

00:08:42.749 --> 00:08:45.137
the most brilliant legal scholar, will be talking.

00:08:45.137 --> 00:08:48.376
He was a former member
of the Obama administration.

00:08:48.376 --> 00:08:51.200
And on the other side of the political spectrum,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.332
George H.W. Bush, number 41, the father,

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.187
he has agreed to participate,

00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:58.623
and Nick Kroll, the comedian,

00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:02.122
and Dr. Oz, and many more to come.

00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:06.520
And, of course, the most important is that you,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.466
I want you guys there,

00:09:08.466 --> 00:09:11.901
and I invite you to go to GlobalFamilyReunion.org

00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:14.996
and figure out how you're on the family tree,

00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:19.189
because these are big issues, family and tribe,

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:21.907
and I don't know all the answers,

00:09:21.907 --> 00:09:24.756
but I have a lot of smart relatives,

00:09:24.756 --> 00:09:26.337
including you guys,

00:09:26.337 --> 00:09:29.604
so together, I think we can figure it out.

00:09:29.604 --> 00:09:32.259
Only together can we solve these big problems.

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.289
So from cousin to cousin,

00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:36.681
I thank you. I can't wait to see you.

00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:38.582
Goodbye.

00:09:38.582 --> 00:09:40.520
(Applause)
