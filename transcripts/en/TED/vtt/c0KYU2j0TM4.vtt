00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.236
When I was nine years old,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.403
I went off to summer camp
for the first time.

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:23.236
And my mother packed me a suitcase
full of books,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.927
which to me seemed like
a perfectly natural thing to do.

00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.236
Because in my family,
reading was the primary group activity.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.236
And this might sound antisocial to you,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.236
but for us it was really just
a different way of being social.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.236
You have the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.118
but you are also free to go
roaming around the adventureland

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.236
inside your own mind.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.236
And I had this idea

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.784
that camp was going to be
just like this, but better.

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:50.236
(Laughter)

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.236
I had a vision of 10 girls
sitting in a cabin

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.641
cozily reading books
in their matching nightgowns.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.236
(Laughter)

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.236
Camp was more like a keg party
without any alcohol.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.236
And on the very first day,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.236
our counselor gathered us all together

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.936
and she taught us a cheer
that she said we would be doing

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.236
every day for the rest of the summer
to instill camp spirit.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.236
And it went like this:

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.236
"R-O-W-D-I-E,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.236
that's the way we spell rowdie.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.653
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:21.677
(Laughter)

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.236
Yeah.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.308
So I couldn't figure out
for the life of me

00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:28.236
why we were supposed to be so rowdy,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.236
or why we had to spell
this word incorrectly.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.236
(Laughter)

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.451
But I recited a cheer. I recited
a cheer along with everybody else.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.236
I did my best.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.339
And I just waited for the time
that I could go off and read my books.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.620
But the first time that I took
my book out of my suitcase,

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.660
the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:55.136
and she asked me, "Why
are you being so mellow?" --

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.208
mellow, of course,
being the exact opposite

00:01:57.232 --> 00:01:58.436
of R-O-W-D-I-E.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.036
And then the second time I tried it,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.236
the counselor came up to me
with a concerned expression on her face

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.356
and she repeated the point
about camp spirit

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.590
and said we should all work very hard
to be outgoing.

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:12.236
And so I put my books away,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.236
back in their suitcase,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.236
and I put them under my bed,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.636
and there they stayed
for the rest of the summer.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.436
And I felt kind of guilty about this.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.436
I felt as if the books needed me somehow,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.236
and they were calling out to me
and I was forsaking them.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.136
But I did forsake them
and I didn't open that suitcase again

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.236
until I was back home with my family
at the end of the summer.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.236
Now, I tell you this story
about summer camp.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.236
I could have told you
50 others just like it --

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.236
all the times that I got the message

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.236
that somehow my quiet
and introverted style of being

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.236
was not necessarily the right way to go,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.236
that I should be trying to pass
as more of an extrovert.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.236
And I always sensed deep down
that this was wrong

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.118
and that introverts were
pretty excellent just as they were.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:59.236
But for years I denied this intuition,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.236
and so I became a Wall Street
lawyer, of all things,

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.236
instead of the writer
that I had always longed to be --

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.236
partly because I needed to prove to myself
that I could be bold and assertive too.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.337
And I was always going off to crowded bars

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:14.933
when I really would have preferred
to just have a nice dinner with friends.

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:19.236
And I made these
self-negating choices so reflexively,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.963
that I wasn't even aware
that I was making them.

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:24.536
Now this is what many introverts do,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.236
and it's our loss for sure,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.236
but it is also our colleagues' loss

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.236
and our communities' loss.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.236
And at the risk of sounding grandiose,
it is the world's loss.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.236
Because when it comes
to creativity and to leadership,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.236
we need introverts doing
what they do best.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.784
A third to a half of the population
are introverts --

00:03:41.808 --> 00:03:43.236
a third to a half.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.236
So that's one out of every two
or three people you know.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.236
So even if you're an extrovert yourself,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.236
I'm talking about your coworkers

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.236
and your spouses and your children

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.236
and the person sitting
next to you right now --

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.236
all of them subject to this bias

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.356
that is pretty deep
and real in our society.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.236
We all internalize it
from a very early age

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.236
without even having a language
for what we're doing.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.236
Now, to see the bias clearly,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.236
you need to understand
what introversion is.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.236
It's different from being shy.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.236
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.236
Introversion is more about,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.236
how do you respond to stimulation,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.236
including social stimulation.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.236
So extroverts really crave
large amounts of stimulation,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.337
whereas introverts feel
at their most alive

00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:28.737
and their most switched-on
and their most capable

00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:31.166
when they're in quieter,
more low-key environments.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.619
Not all the time --
these things aren't absolute --

00:04:33.643 --> 00:04:34.836
but a lot of the time.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.236
So the key then to maximizing our talents

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.236
is for us all to put ourselves

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.236
in the zone of stimulation
that is right for us.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.236
But now here's where the bias comes in.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.236
Our most important institutions,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.236
our schools and our workplaces,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.236
they are designed mostly for extroverts

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.236
and for extroverts' need
for lots of stimulation.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.236
And also we have
this belief system right now

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.236
that I call the new groupthink,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.236
which holds that all creativity
and all productivity

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.260
comes from a very oddly gregarious place.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.594
So if you picture the typical
classroom nowadays:

00:05:11.618 --> 00:05:15.236
When I was going to school,
we sat in rows.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.236
We sat in rows of desks like this,

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.523
and we did most of our work
pretty autonomously.

00:05:19.547 --> 00:05:23.236
But nowadays, your typical classroom
has pods of desks --

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.236
four or five or six or seven kids
all facing each other.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.737
And kids are working
in countless group assignments.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.236
Even in subjects like math
and creative writing,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.236
which you think would depend
on solo flights of thought,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.236
kids are now expected to act
as committee members.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.451
And for the kids who prefer to go off
by themselves or just to work alone,

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.336
those kids are seen as outliers often

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.260
or, worse, as problem cases.

00:05:49.006 --> 00:05:50.882
And the vast majority of teachers

00:05:50.906 --> 00:05:53.636
reports believing that
the ideal student is an extrovert

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.236
as opposed to an introvert,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.594
even though introverts
actually get better grades

00:05:57.618 --> 00:05:59.236
and are more knowledgeable,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.236
according to research.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.236
(Laughter)

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.236
Okay, same thing is true
in our workplaces.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.236
Now, most of us work in open plan offices,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.236
without walls,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.546
where we are subject to the constant
noise and gaze of our coworkers.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.236
And when it comes to leadership,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.236
introverts are routinely passed over
for leadership positions,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.476
even though introverts
tend to be very careful,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.476
much less likely to take outsize risks --

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.236
which is something
we might all favor nowadays.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.236
And interesting research
by Adam Grant at the Wharton School

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.236
has found that introverted leaders

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.594
often deliver better outcomes
than extroverts do,

00:06:34.618 --> 00:06:37.236
because when they are managing
proactive employees,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.523
they're much more likely to let
those employees run with their ideas,

00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:42.643
whereas an extrovert
can, quite unwittingly,

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:44.236
get so excited about things

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.476
that they're putting
their own stamp on things,

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.236
and other people's ideas might not
as easily then bubble up to the surface.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.036
Now in fact, some of our transformative
leaders in history have been introverts.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.436
I'll give you some examples.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.236
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.236
all these people described themselves
as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.236
And they all took the spotlight,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.260
even though every bone in their bodies
was telling them not to.

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.136
And this turns out to have
a special power all its own,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.136
because people could feel
that these leaders were at the helm

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.136
not because they enjoyed directing others

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.436
and not out of the pleasure
of being looked at;

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.508
they were there
because they had no choice,

00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:26.704
because they were driven to do
what they thought was right.

00:07:26.728 --> 00:07:29.336
Now I think at this point
it's important for me to say

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.236
that I actually love extroverts.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.236
I always like to say some of my best
friends are extroverts,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260
including my beloved husband.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.499
And we all fall
at different points, of course,

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:44.236
along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.666
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist
who first popularized these terms,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.081
said that there's no such thing
as a pure introvert

00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:51.436
or a pure extrovert.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.984
He said that such a man
would be in a lunatic asylum,

00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:56.236
if he existed at all.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.236
And some people fall smack in the middle
of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.236
and we call these people ambiverts.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.260
And I often think that they have
the best of all worlds.

00:08:06.259 --> 00:08:09.236
But many of us do recognize
ourselves as one type or the other.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.546
And what I'm saying is that culturally,
we need a much better balance.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.236
We need more of a yin and yang
between these two types.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.236
This is especially important

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.546
when it comes to creativity
and to productivity,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.236
because when psychologists look
at the lives of the most creative people,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.236
what they find

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.546
are people who are very good
at exchanging ideas

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.236
and advancing ideas,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.236
but who also have a serious
streak of introversion in them.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.489
And this is because solitude

00:08:35.513 --> 00:08:37.636
is a crucial ingredient
often to creativity.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.236
So Darwin,

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.236
he took long walks alone in the woods

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.236
and emphatically turned down
dinner-party invitations.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.236
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.285
he dreamed up many
of his amazing creations

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:51.285
in a lonely bell tower office that he had

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:54.236
in the back of his house
in La Jolla, California.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.236
And he was actually afraid to meet
the young children who read his books

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.260
for fear that they were expecting him
this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:06.236
and would be disappointed
with his more reserved persona.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.499
Steve Wozniak invented
the first Apple computer

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:11.520
sitting alone in his cubicle
in Hewlett-Packard

00:09:11.544 --> 00:09:13.181
where he was working at the time.

00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:16.880
And he says that he never would have
become such an expert in the first place

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:19.336
had he not been too introverted
to leave the house

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.636
when he was growing up.

00:09:21.068 --> 00:09:23.236
Now, of course,

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.236
this does not mean that we should
all stop collaborating --

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.880
and case in point, is Steve Wozniak
famously coming together with Steve Jobs

00:09:29.904 --> 00:09:32.236
to start Apple Computer --

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.236
but it does mean that solitude matters

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.236
and that for some people
it is the air that they breathe.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.236
And in fact, we have known for centuries
about the transcendent power of solitude.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.236
It's only recently that
we've strangely begun to forget it.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.236
If you look at most
of the world's major religions,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.236
you will find seekers --

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.236
Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.236
seekers who are going off by themselves
alone to the wilderness,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.936
where they then have profound
epiphanies and revelations

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.636
that they then bring back
to the rest of the community.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.236
So, no wilderness, no revelations.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.236
This is no surprise, though,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.236
if you look at the insights
of contemporary psychology.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.236
It turns out that we can't
even be in a group of people

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.236
without instinctively mirroring,
mimicking their opinions.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.594
Even about seemingly
personal and visceral things

00:10:22.618 --> 00:10:24.236
like who you're attracted to,

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.236
you will start aping the beliefs
of the people around you

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.784
without even realizing
that that's what you're doing.

00:10:29.808 --> 00:10:32.236
And groups famously follow the opinions

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.936
of the most dominant
or charismatic person in the room,

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.736
even though there's zero correlation

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.536
between being the best talker
and having the best ideas --

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.236
I mean zero.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.236
So --

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.236
(Laughter)

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.236
You might be following the person
with the best ideas,

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.236
but you might not.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.236
And do you really want
to leave it up to chance?

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.641
Much better for everybody
to go off by themselves,

00:10:55.665 --> 00:10:57.236
generate their own ideas

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.403
freed from the distortions
of group dynamics,

00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:01.236
and then come together as a team

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.236
to talk them through
in a well-managed environment

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.236
and take it from there.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.236
Now if all this is true,

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.236
then why are we getting it so wrong?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.236
Why are we setting up our schools
this way, and our workplaces?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.784
And why are we making
these introverts feel so guilty

00:11:16.808 --> 00:11:19.736
about wanting to just go off
by themselves some of the time?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.236
One answer lies deep
in our cultural history.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.236
Western societies,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.236
and in particular the U.S.,

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.365
have always favored the man of action
over the "man" of contemplation.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:37.236
But in America's early days,

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.236
we lived in what historians
call a culture of character,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.356
where we still,
at that point, valued people

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.236
for their inner selves
and their moral rectitude.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.836
And if you look at the self-help
books from this era,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.636
they all had titles with things like

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.236
"Character, the Grandest
Thing in the World."

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.236
And they featured role models
like Abraham Lincoln,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.546
who was praised for being
modest and unassuming.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.236
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.236
"A man who does not
offend by superiority."

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.236
But then we hit the 20th century,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.236
and we entered a new culture

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.523
that historians call
the culture of personality.

00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:12.223
What happened is we had evolved
an agricultural economy

00:12:12.247 --> 00:12:13.636
to a world of big business.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.236
And so suddenly people are moving
from small towns to the cities.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.571
And instead of working alongside people
they've known all their lives,

00:12:20.595 --> 00:12:24.236
now they are having to prove themselves
in a crowd of strangers.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.236
So, quite understandably,

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.236
qualities like magnetism and charisma
suddenly come to seem really important.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.451
And sure enough, the self-help books
change to meet these new needs

00:12:33.475 --> 00:12:35.236
and they start to have names

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.476
like "How to Win Friends
and Influence People."

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.236
And they feature as their role models
really great salesmen.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.260
So that's the world we're living in today.

00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:48.236
That's our cultural inheritance.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:53.236
Now none of this is to say
that social skills are unimportant,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.236
and I'm also not calling
for the abolishing of teamwork at all.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.451
The same religions who send their sages
off to lonely mountain tops

00:13:01.475 --> 00:13:04.236
also teach us love and trust.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.236
And the problems that we are facing today

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.236
in fields like science and in economics

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.236
are so vast and so complex

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.036
that we are going to need armies
of people coming together

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.636
to solve them working together.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.436
But I am saying that the more freedom
that we give introverts to be themselves,

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.936
the more likely that they are

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.960
to come up with their own unique
solutions to these problems.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:29.260
So now I'd like to share with you
what's in my suitcase today.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.236
Guess what?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.236
Books.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.236
I have a suitcase full of books.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.236
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.236
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.236
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed"
by Maimonides.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.236
But these are not exactly my books.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.236
I brought these books with me

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.236
because they were written
by my grandfather's favorite authors.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.236
My grandfather was a rabbi

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.236
and he was a widower

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.236
who lived alone in a small
apartment in Brooklyn

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.236
that was my favorite place
in the world when I was growing up,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.689
partly because it was filled with
his very gentle, very courtly presence

00:14:11.713 --> 00:14:14.236
and partly because
it was filled with books.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.236
I mean literally every table,
every chair in this apartment

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.236
had yielded its original function

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.236
to now serve as a surface
for swaying stacks of books.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.236
Just like the rest of my family,

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.546
my grandfather's favorite thing to do
in the whole world was to read.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.236
But he also loved his congregation,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.236
and you could feel this love
in the sermons that he gave

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.236
every week for the 62 years
that he was a rabbi.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.236
He would takes the fruits
of each week's reading

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.572
and he would weave

00:14:41.596 --> 00:14:44.437
these intricate tapestries
of ancient and humanist thought.

00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:47.099
And people would come from all over
to hear him speak.

00:14:47.963 --> 00:14:50.236
But here's the thing about my grandfather.

00:14:51.327 --> 00:14:52.936
Underneath this ceremonial role,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.236
he was really modest
and really introverted --

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.236
so much so that when
he delivered these sermons,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.236
he had trouble making eye contact

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.260
with the very same congregation
that he had been speaking to for 62 years.

00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:06.236
And even away from the podium,

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.236
when you called him to say hello,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.499
he would often end
the conversation prematurely

00:15:10.523 --> 00:15:14.236
for fear that he was taking up
too much of your time.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.236
But when he died at the age of 94,

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.236
the police had to close down
the streets of his neighborhood

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.170
to accommodate the crowd of people
who came out to mourn him.

00:15:27.106 --> 00:15:30.136
And so these days I try to learn
from my grandfather's example

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.536
in my own way.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.236
So I just published a book
about introversion,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.260
and it took me about seven years to write.

00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:39.236
And for me, that seven years
was like total bliss,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.236
because I was reading, I was writing,

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.236
I was thinking, I was researching.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.236
It was my version

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.236
of my grandfather's hours
of the day alone in his library.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.236
But now all of a sudden
my job is very different,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.236
and my job is to be
out here talking about it,

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.236
talking about introversion.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.236
(Laughter)

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.236
And that's a lot harder for me,

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.236
because as honored as I am
to be here with all of you right now,

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.236
this is not my natural milieu.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:15.236
So I prepared for moments
like these as best I could.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.546
I spent the last year
practicing public speaking

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.236
every chance I could get.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.236
And I call this my "year
of speaking dangerously."

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.236
(Laughter)

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.236
And that actually helped a lot.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.236
But I'll tell you, what helps even more

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.236
is my sense, my belief, my hope
that when it comes to our attitudes

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.380
to introversion and to quiet
and to solitude,

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:37.881
we truly are poised on the brink
on dramatic change.

00:16:37.905 --> 00:16:39.236
I mean, we are.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.236
And so I am going to leave you now

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.236
with three calls for action
for those who share this vision.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.236
Number one:

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.236
Stop the madness for constant group work.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.236
Just stop it.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.236
(Laughter)

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.236
Thank you.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.236
(Applause)

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.403
And I want to be clear
about what I'm saying,

00:17:00.427 --> 00:17:02.236
because I deeply believe our offices

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.236
should be encouraging casual, chatty
cafe-style types of interactions --

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.380
you know, the kind
where people come together

00:17:08.404 --> 00:17:10.595
and serendipitously have
an exchange of ideas.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.236
That is great.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.936
It's great for introverts
and it's great for extroverts.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.389
But we need much more privacy
and much more freedom

00:17:17.413 --> 00:17:18.936
and much more autonomy at work.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.236
School, same thing.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.236
We need to be teaching kids
to work together, for sure,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.236
but we also need to be teaching them
how to work on their own.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.036
This is especially important
for extroverted children too.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.536
They need to work on their own

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.132
because that is where deep thought
comes from in part.

00:17:33.156 --> 00:17:35.236
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.236
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.236
I'm not saying

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.499
that we all have to now go off and build
our own cabins in the woods

00:17:43.523 --> 00:17:46.236
and never talk to each other again,

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.594
but I am saying that we could
all stand to unplug

00:17:48.618 --> 00:17:53.260
and get inside our own heads
a little more often.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.236
Number three:

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.689
Take a good look
at what's inside your own suitcase

00:17:59.713 --> 00:18:01.236
and why you put it there.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.236
So extroverts,

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.333
maybe your suitcases
are also full of books.

00:18:05.357 --> 00:18:10.236
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses
or skydiving equipment.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.236
Whatever it is, I hope you take
these things out every chance you get

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.236
and grace us with your energy
and your joy.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.236
But introverts, you being you,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.814
you probably have the impulse
to guard very carefully

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:24.714
what's inside your own suitcase.

00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:26.236
And that's okay.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.236
But occasionally, just occasionally,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.260
I hope you will open up your suitcases
for other people to see,

00:18:31.284 --> 00:18:34.284
because the world needs you and it
needs the things you carry.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.499
So I wish you the best
of all possible journeys

00:18:38.523 --> 00:18:41.236
and the courage to speak softly.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:43.236
Thank you very much.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.236
(Applause)

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.236
Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:57.260
(Applause)
