00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.606
I've always had a fascination
for computers and technology,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.330
and I made a few apps for the iPhone,
iPod touch, and iPad.

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:25.796
I'd like to share a couple with you today.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.520
My first app was a unique
fortune teller called "Earth Fortune"

00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:32.933
that would display
different colors of Earth

00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:34.939
depending on what your fortune was.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.253
My favorite and most successful app

00:00:39.277 --> 00:00:41.138
is "Bustin Jieber," which is --

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:42.385
(Laughter)

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:45.103
which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:46.436
(Laughter)

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.843
I created it because
a lot of people at school

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:52.184
disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.954
so I decided to make the app.

00:00:54.978 --> 00:00:57.133
So I went to work programming it,

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:00.823
and I released it
just before the holidays in 2010.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:05.736
A lot of people ask me,
how did I make these?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.652
A lot of times it's because
the person who asked the question

00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.698
wants to make an app also.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:13.825
A lot of kids these days
like to play games,

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:17.379
but now they want to make them,
and it's difficult,

00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:22.339
because not many kids know where to go
to find out how to make a program.

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:24.858
I mean, for soccer,
you could go to a soccer team.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:27.899
For violin, you could get
lessons for a violin.

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:29.910
But what if you want to make an app?

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.941
And the kid's parents might have done
some of these things when they were young,

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:35.823
but not many parents have written apps.

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:38.154
(Laughter)

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:40.727
Where do you go to find out
how to make an app?

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:43.487
Well, this is how I approached it,
this is what I did.

00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:48.685
First of all, I've been programming
in multiple other programming languages

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.719
to get the basics down,

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:54.338
such as Python, C, Java, etc.

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.494
And then Apple released the iPhone,

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.532
and with it, the iPhone
software development kit,

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:04.135
and the software development kit
is a suite of tools

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.861
for creating and programming
an iPhone app.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:11.476
This opened up a whole new world
of possibilities for me,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.770
and after playing with the software
development kit a little bit,

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:18.681
I made a couple of apps,
I made some test apps.

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:20.848
One of them happened to be
"Earth Fortune,"

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:23.740
and I was ready to put
"Earth Fortune" on the App Store,

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:28.139
and so I persuaded my parents
to pay the 99 dollar fee

00:02:28.163 --> 00:02:30.959
to be able to put my apps
on the App Store.

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:33.953
They agreed, and now I have
apps on the App Store.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.623
I've gotten a lot of interest
and encouragement

00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:41.316
from my family, friends, teachers
and even people at the Apple Store,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.321
and that's been a huge help to me.

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:47.478
I've gotten a lot
of inspiration from Steve Jobs,

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:50.411
and I've started an app club at school,

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:55.546
and a teacher at my school
is kindly sponsoring my app club.

00:02:56.081 --> 00:03:00.852
Any student at my school can come
and learn how to design an app.

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:05.758
This is so I can share
my experiences with others.

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:10.202
There's these programs
called the iPad Pilot Program,

00:03:10.226 --> 00:03:12.796
and some districts have them.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.033
I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.

00:03:15.503 --> 00:03:19.502
A big challenge is,
how should the iPads be used,

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:22.216
and what apps should we put on the iPads?

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:26.776
So we're getting feedback
from teachers at the school

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.868
to see what kind of apps they'd like.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:31.676
When we design the app and we sell it,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.519
it will be free to local districts;
and other districts that we sell to --

00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:41.463
all the money from that will go
into the local ed foundations.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:48.114
These days, students usually know
a little bit more than teachers

00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:49.698
with the technology.

00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:54.037
(Laughter)

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:55.285
So --

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.248
(Laughter)

00:03:58.272 --> 00:03:59.458
Sorry.

00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:02.145
(Laughter)

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:04.875
So this is a resource to teachers,

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.994
and educators should recognize
this resource and make good use of it.

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:10.700
(Laughter)

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:15.304
I'd like to finish up by saying
what I'd like to do in the future.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:20.312
First of all, I'd like to create
more apps, more games.

00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:23.266
I'm working with a third party
company to make an app.

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.895
I'd like to get into Android
programming and development,

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.206
and I'd like to continue my app club,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.855
and find other ways for students
to share knowledge with others.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.038
Thank you.

00:04:35.062 --> 00:04:36.596
(Applause)
