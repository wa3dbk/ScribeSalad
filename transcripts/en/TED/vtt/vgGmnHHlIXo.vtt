00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.330
So, indeed, I have spent my life

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.330
looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
But when I try and think about what I've learned

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.330
about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.330
to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
He taught us that the richest and fullest lives

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.330
attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.330
work, love and play.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.330
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.330
is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.330
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
but with serenity.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.330
So since I tell stories, let me look back

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.330
on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330
Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.330
As for that first sphere of work,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.330
I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
is that fierce ambition is a good thing.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.330
He had a huge ambition.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.330
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.330
what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.330
so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.330
Even as a child, it seemed, Lincoln dreamed heroic dreams.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.330
from which he was born.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.330
No schooling was possible for him,

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.330
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.330
He couldn't eat.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.330
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.330
How true for Lincoln.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.330
Though he never would travel to Europe,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.330
he went with Shakespeare's kings to merry England,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
But there were so many losses in his early life

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.330
that he was haunted by death.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
His mother died when he was only nine years old;

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.330
and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.330
Moreover, when his mother lay dying,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.330
she did not hold out for him the hope

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330
that they would meet in an afterworld.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.330
She simply said to him,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.330
"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.330
As a result he became obsessed with the thought

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.330
But only as he grew older did he develop

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
but followed by other cultures as well --

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.330
you could live on in the memory of others.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.330
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.330
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.330
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.330
when he was in his early 30s.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.330
Three things had combined to lay him low.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
not certain he was ready to marry her,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.330
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.330
to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And his political career in the state legislature

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
was on a downward slide.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.330
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.330
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.330
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.330
but I've not yet done anything to make any human being

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.330
remember that I have lived."

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.330
So fueled by that ambition, he returned to the state legislature.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.330
He eventually won a seat in Congress.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
"but some people are stronger in the broken places."

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
for the presidency over three far more experienced,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.330
far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330
And then when he won the general election,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.330
he stunned the nation even more

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.330
by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.330
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.330
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330
He said, "Look, these are the strongest

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.330
and most able men in the country.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.330
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.330
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330
might have put it in less noble fashion:

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.330
"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
than outside the tent pissing in."

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
(Laughter)

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
But it soon became clear that Abraham Lincoln

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.330
would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330
For each of them soon came to understand

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
that he possessed an unparalleled array of

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
emotional strengths and political skills

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.330
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.330
to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
into permanent hostility.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
He shared credit with ease,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
(Applause)

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.330
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.330
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.330
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.330
in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.330
the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
had worked their way into his very soul.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.330
In 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.330
he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.330
and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.330
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.330
"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.330
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330
his own hand was numb and shaking

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.330
because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
So he put the pen down.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.330
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.330
But if I sign with a shaking hand,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
So he waited until he could take up the pen

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
and sign with a bold and clear hand.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.330
But even in his wildest dreams,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.330
Lincoln could never have imagined

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.330
how far his reputation would reach.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.330
I was so thrilled to find an interview with the great Russian writer,

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.330
Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.330
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.330
to a very remote area of the Caucasus,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.330
where there were only wild barbarians,

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.330
who had never left this part of Russia.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.330
they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.330
and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.330
and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.330
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.330
'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.330
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.330
who laughed like the sunrise,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.330
that if a young man should travel there,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.330
he would be an old man when he arrived.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.330
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.330
He was stunned.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.330
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.330
Not as great a general as Napoleon,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.330
not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.330
in the integrity of his character

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.330
and the moral fiber of his being.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
So in the end that powerful ambition

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.330
that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.330
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.330
to go through that string of political failures

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and the darkest days of the war.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.330
His story would be told.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.330
encompassing family, friends and colleagues --

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.330
it, too, takes work and commitment.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.330
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
when I helped him on his memoirs,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
work, power and individual success,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.330
that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.330
to get him through the days

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.330
once the presidency was gone.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.330
My relationship with him began on a rather curious level.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
We had a big dance at the White House.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.330
President Johnson did dance with me that night.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.330
Not that peculiar --

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.330
there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.330
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.330
to work directly for him in the White House.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.330
But it was not to be that simple.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
For in the months leading up to my selection,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
like many young people, I'd been active

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.330
in the anti-Vietnam War movement,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.330
and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.330
which unfortunately came out in The New Republic

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.330
two days after the dance in the White House.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.330
(Laugher)

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.330
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.330
(Laughter)

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.330
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.330
But instead, surprisingly, he said,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.330
"Oh, bring her down here for a year,

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.330
and if I can't win her over, no one can."

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.330
So I did end up working for him in the White House.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.330
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.330
never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.330
I like to believe it was because I was a good listener.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.330
He was a great storyteller.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.330
There was a problem with these stories, however,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.330
which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.330
But they were great, nonetheless.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.330
(Laughter)

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.330
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.330
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
even when I didn't have any at all.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.330
Everything was working perfectly,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.330
until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.330
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.330
conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.330
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.330
all the romantic trappings.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.330
And he started out,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
And my heart sank.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.330
And then he said,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
"You remind me of my mother."

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.330
(Laughter)

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.330
It was pretty embarrassing, given what was going on in my mind.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.330
But I must say, the older I've gotten,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.330
the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.330
to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.330
A victor in a thousand contests,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.330
three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.330
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.330
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.330
he opened up to me in ways he never would have

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.330
had I known him at the height of his power --

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.330
sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.330
the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.330
that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.330
But it also brought home to me the lessons

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.330
which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.330
about the importance of finding balance in life.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.330
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:03.330
everything in the world to feel good about in those last years,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.330
in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.330
he had all the money he needed to pursue

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.330
any leisure activity he wanted;

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.330
he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.330
sailboats, speedboats.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.330
He had servants to answer any whim,

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.330
and he had a family who loved him deeply.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.330
And yet, years of concentration solely on work and individual success

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:27.330
meant that in his retirement he could find no solace

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:31.330
in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.330
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.330
that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.330
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.330
until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.330
In those last years, he said he was so sad

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.330
watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.330
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
and their children in turn.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
But it was too late.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
Despite all that power, all that wealth,

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:02.330
he was alone when he finally died --

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.330
his ultimate terror realized.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.330
So as for that third sphere of play,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.330
which he never had learned to enjoy,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.330
I've learned over the years

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.330
that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.330
enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.330
or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.330
can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.330
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.330
that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.330
even during those dark days of the war.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.330
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.330
for a few precious hours he could imagine himself

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.330
back in Prince Hal's time.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.330
But an even more important form of relaxation for him,

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.330
was a love of -- somehow -- humor,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.330
and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.330
as a sidelight to the sadness.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.330
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.330
that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.330
His storytelling powers had first been recognized

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.330
when he was on the circuit in Illinois.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.330
The lawyers and the judges would travel

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.330
from one county courthouse to the other,

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.330
and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.330
they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.330
He would stand with his back against a fire

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.330
and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.330
And all these stories became part of his memory bank,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.330
so he could call on them whenever he needed to.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.330
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.330
One of his favorite stories, for example,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.330
had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.330
And as Lincoln told the story,

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.330
Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.330
And the British people were still upset

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.330
about losing the Revolution,

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.330
so they decided to embarrass him a little bit

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.330
by putting a huge picture of General Washington

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.330
in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.330
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.330
of George Washington being in an outhouse.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.330
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.330
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.330
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.330
"What do you mean?" they said.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.330
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.330
faster than the sight of General George Washington."

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.330
(Laughter)

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.330
(Applause)

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.330
So you can imagine, if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting --

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:18.330
and he had hundreds of these stories --

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
you would have to relax.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.330
So between his nightly treks to the theater,

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.330
his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.330
and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.330
he found that form of play which carried him through his days.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.330
In my own life, I shall always be grateful

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.330
for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.330
to the end of the fall,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.330
to have something to occupy my mind and heart

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.330
other than my work.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.330
It all began when I was only six years old,

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.330
and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.330
while listening to baseball games --

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.330
so that when he went to work in New York during the day,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.330
I could record for him the history of that afternoon's

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.330
Brooklyn Dodgers game.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.330
Now, when you're only six years old,

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.330
and your father comes home every single night

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:06.330
and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.330
recounted every single play of every inning

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.330
of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.330
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.330
It makes you think there's something magic about history

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.330
to keep your father's attention.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.330
In fact, I'm convinced I learned the narrative art

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.330
from those nightly sessions with my father.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.330
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.330
"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.330
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.330
(Laughter)

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.330
So I finally learned you had to tell a story

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.330
from beginning to middle to end.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.330
I must say, so fervent was my love

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.330
of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.330
that I had to confess in my first confession

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.330
two sins that related to baseball.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.330
The first occurred because the Dodgers' catcher, Roy Campanella,

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.330
came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.330
just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.330
And I was so excited --

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.330
first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.330
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.330
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.330
that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.330
you'll be struck dead at the threshold.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.330
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.330
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.330
It's not a sin."

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.330
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.330
I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.330
for this one night with Roy Campanella.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.330
(Laughter)

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.330
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.330
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.330
I told the priest right away.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.330
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.330
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.330
And then came my second sin.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.330
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.330
wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.330
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:41.330
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.330
would break arms, legs and ankles --

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.330
(Laughter)

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.330
-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.330
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.330
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.330
(Laughter)

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.330
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.330
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.330
but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.330
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.330
"Oh yes," I said.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.330
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:05.330
(Laughter)

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.330
Well, though my father died of a sudden heart attack

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.330
when I was still in my 20s,

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:13.330
before I had gotten married and had my three sons,

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.330
I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.330
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.330
I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.330
and became an irrational Red Sox fan.

00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.330
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.330
with our season tickets,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.330
I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.330
and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.330
watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.330
Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
I must say there is magic in these moments.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.330
When I open my eyes and I see my sons

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.330
in the place where my father once sat,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.330
I feel an invisible loyalty and love

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.330
linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.330
but whose heart and soul they have come to know

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.330
through all the stories I have told.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.330
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.330
allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.330
Allowing me to learn from these large figures

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.330
about the struggle for meaning for life.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.330
Allowing me to believe that the private people

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
we have loved and lost in our families,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.330
and the public figures we have respected in our history,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.330
just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.330
really can live on, so long as we pledge

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.330
to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.330
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.330
(Applause)

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.330
Thank you.
