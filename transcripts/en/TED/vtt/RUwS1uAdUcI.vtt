00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:29.981
About 10 years ago, I took on the task
to teach global development

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:32.151
to Swedish undergraduate students.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:35.056
That was after having spent
about 20 years,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.957
together with African institutions,

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:38.579
studying hunger in Africa.

00:00:38.603 --> 00:00:42.601
So I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.976
And I started, in our medical university,
Karolinska Institute,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.530
an undergraduate course
called Global Health.

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:52.376
But when you get that opportunity,
you get a little nervous.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.734
I thought, these students coming to us
actually have the highest grade

00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:57.781
you can get in the Swedish college system,

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:01.170
so I thought, maybe they know everything
I'm going to teach them about.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:03.191
So I did a pretest when they came.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.708
And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one:

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:11.001
"Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs?"

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.960
And I put them together
so that in each pair of countries,

00:01:14.984 --> 00:01:18.429
one has twice the child
mortality of the other.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.698
And this means that
it's much bigger, the difference,

00:01:22.722 --> 00:01:24.524
than the uncertainty of the data.

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:26.859
I won't put you at a test here,
but it's Turkey,

00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:31.210
which is highest there, Poland,
Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:33.656
And these were the results
of the Swedish students.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.850
I did it so I got the confidence interval,
which is pretty narrow.

00:01:36.874 --> 00:01:40.859
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8
right answer out of five possible.

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:44.094
That means there was a place
for a professor of international health

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:45.284
and for my course.

00:01:45.308 --> 00:01:46.341
(Laughter)

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:50.404
But one late night,
when I was compiling the report,

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:52.994
I really realized my discovery.

00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:57.943
I have shown that Swedish top students
know, statistically,

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.976
significantly less about the world
than the chimpanzees.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.459
Because the chimpanzee
would score half right

00:02:06.483 --> 00:02:09.113
if I gave them two bananas
with Sri Lanka and Turkey.

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:12.559
They would be right half of the cases.
But the students are not there.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:16.798
The problem for me was not ignorance;
it was preconceived ideas.

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:19.559
I did also an unethical study

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:22.110
of the professors
of the Karolinska Institute,

00:02:22.134 --> 00:02:24.675
which hands out
the Nobel Prize in Medicine,

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.995
and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there.

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.454
(Laughter)

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:33.661
This is where I realized that
there was really a need to communicate,

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.589
because the data
of what's happening in the world

00:02:36.613 --> 00:02:38.574
and the child health of every country

00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:39.935
is very well aware.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.726
So we did this software,
which displays it like this.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.708
Every bubble here is a country.

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:49.721
This country over here is China.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:50.908
This is India.

00:02:50.932 --> 00:02:53.179
The size of the bubble is the population,

00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:56.759
and on this axis here,
I put fertility rate.

00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:59.226
Because my students, what they said

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.809
when they looked upon the world,
and I asked them,

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:04.556
"What do you really
think about the world?"

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.849
Well, I first discovered
that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.

00:03:07.873 --> 00:03:08.918
(Laughter)

00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:11.457
And they said, "The world
is still 'we' and 'them.'

00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:14.934
And 'we' is the Western world
and 'them' is the Third World."

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:17.891
"And what do you mean
with 'Western world?'" I said.

00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:19.892
"Well, that's long life and small family.

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.304
And 'Third World' is short life
and large family."

00:03:23.058 --> 00:03:25.443
So this is what I could display here.

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:27.124
I put fertility rate here --

00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:30.286
number of children per woman:
one, two, three, four,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.341
up to about eight children per woman.

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:36.345
We have very good data
since 1962, 1960, about,

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:38.402
on the size of families in all countries.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:39.801
The error margin is narrow.

00:03:39.825 --> 00:03:41.833
Here, I put life expectancy at birth,

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:45.324
from 30 years in some countries,
up to about 70 years.

00:03:45.348 --> 00:03:48.751
And in 1962, there was really
a group of countries here

00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:50.632
that were industrialized countries,

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:53.750
and they had small families
and long lives.

00:03:53.774 --> 00:03:55.874
And these were the developing countries.

00:03:55.898 --> 00:03:58.939
They had large families
and they had relatively short lives.

00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:02.644
Now, what has happened since 1962?
We want to see the change.

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:05.605
Are the students right?
It's still two types of countries?

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.365
Or have these developing countries
got smaller families and they live here?

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.687
Or have they got longer lives
and live up there?

00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:13.552
Let's see. We stopped the world then.

00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:16.062
This is all UN statistics
that have been available.

00:04:16.086 --> 00:04:17.587
Here we go. Can you see there?

00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:20.898
It's China there, moving against
better health there, improving there.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:24.567
All the green Latin American countries
are moving towards smaller families.

00:04:24.591 --> 00:04:27.013
Your yellow ones here
are the Arabic countries,

00:04:27.037 --> 00:04:30.938
and they get longer life,
but not larger families.

00:04:30.962 --> 00:04:33.584
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.

00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.249
This is India; Indonesia
is moving on pretty fast.

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:40.379
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh
still among the African countries.

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:43.631
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle
that happens in the '80s --

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:46.068
the imams start to promote
family planning,

00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:47.839
and they move up into that corner.

00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:51.161
And in the '90s, we have
the terrible HIV epidemic

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:54.694
that takes down the life expectancy
of the African countries.

00:04:54.718 --> 00:04:58.366
And the rest of them all
move up into the corner,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.776
where we have long lives and small family,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.914
and we have a completely new world.

00:05:02.938 --> 00:05:06.152
(Applause)

00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:14.658
(Applause ends)

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.380
Let me make a comparison directly

00:05:17.404 --> 00:05:20.418
between the United States
of America and Vietnam.

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:21.641
1964:

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:25.149
America had small families and long life;

00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:28.522
Vietnam had large families
and short lives.

00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:29.829
And this is what happens.

00:05:29.853 --> 00:05:35.194
The data during the war indicate
that even with all the death,

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.447
there was an improvement
of life expectancy.

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.255
By the end of the year,
family planning started in Vietnam,

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.973
and they went for smaller families.

00:05:41.997 --> 00:05:44.566
And the United States up there
is getting longer life,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.778
keeping family size.

00:05:45.802 --> 00:05:49.407
And in the '80s now,
they give up Communist planning

00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:50.938
and they go for market economy,

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:52.972
and it moves faster even than social life.

00:05:52.996 --> 00:05:55.332
And today, we have in Vietnam

00:05:55.356 --> 00:06:00.158
the same life expectancy
and the same family size

00:06:00.182 --> 00:06:02.945
here in Vietnam, 2003,

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.036
as in United States, 1974,
by the end of the war.

00:06:07.513 --> 00:06:10.809
I think we all, if we don't
look at the data,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:14.054
we underestimate
the tremendous change in Asia,

00:06:14.078 --> 00:06:18.769
which was in social change
before we saw the economic change.

00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:21.160
So let's move over to another way here

00:06:21.184 --> 00:06:25.671
in which we could display
the distribution in the world

00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:26.975
of income.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.695
This is the world distribution
of income of people.

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:35.345
One dollar, 10 dollars
or 100 dollars per day.

00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:39.483
There's no gap between rich
and poor any longer. This is a myth.

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:41.522
There's a little hump here.

00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:43.835
But there are people all the way.

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:48.245
And if we look where the income ends up,

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:52.464
this is 100 percent
of the world's annual income.

00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.953
And the richest 20 percent,

00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:59.096
they take out of that about 74 percent.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.036
And the poorest 20 percent,
they take about two percent.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.815
And this shows that the concept
of developing countries

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.406
is extremely doubtful.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.311
We think about aid,

00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.948
like these people here giving aid
to these people here.

00:07:13.972 --> 00:07:17.092
But in the middle, we have
most of the world population,

00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:19.725
and they have now
24 percent of the income.

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:21.405
We heard it in other forms.

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:24.130
And who are these?

00:07:24.154 --> 00:07:26.374
Where are the different countries?

00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:27.944
I can show you Africa.

00:07:27.968 --> 00:07:29.559
This is Africa.

00:07:30.078 --> 00:07:31.841
Ten percent of the world population,

00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:33.031
most in poverty.

00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:37.430
This is OECD -- the rich countries,
the country club of the UN.

00:07:37.454 --> 00:07:42.870
And they are over here on this side.
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.

00:07:42.894 --> 00:07:44.242
And this is Latin America.

00:07:44.266 --> 00:07:47.621
It has everything on this earth,
from the poorest to the richest

00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:49.018
in Latin America.

00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:52.149
And on top of that,
we can put East Europe,

00:07:52.173 --> 00:07:55.348
we can put East Asia,
and we put South Asia.

00:07:55.372 --> 00:07:58.502
And what did it look like
if we go back in time,

00:07:58.526 --> 00:08:00.619
to about 1970?

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:03.165
Then, there was more of a hump.

00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:08.001
And most who lived
in absolute poverty were Asians.

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:10.972
The problem in the world
was the poverty in Asia.

00:08:10.996 --> 00:08:14.114
And if I now let the world move forward,

00:08:14.138 --> 00:08:16.750
you will see that
while population increases,

00:08:16.774 --> 00:08:20.087
there are hundreds of millions
in Asia getting out of poverty,

00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:22.076
and some others getting into poverty,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.001
and this is the pattern we have today.

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.096
And the best projection
from the World Bank

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.034
is that this will happen,

00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:29.906
and we will not have a divided world.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.825
We'll have most people in the middle.

00:08:31.849 --> 00:08:33.876
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.297
but our concept of economy
is growth with percent.

00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:42.606
We look upon it as a possibility
of percentile increase.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.454
If I change this and take GDP per capita
instead of family income,

00:08:47.478 --> 00:08:51.249
and I turn these individual data

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:54.549
into regional data
of gross domestic product,

00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:56.461
and I take the regions down here,

00:08:56.485 --> 00:08:58.724
the size of the bubble
is still the population.

00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.946
And you have the OECD there,
and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.211
and we take off the Arab states there,

00:09:04.235 --> 00:09:06.453
coming both from Africa and from Asia,

00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:08.143
and we put them separately,

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:13.264
and we can expand this axis,
and I can give it a new dimension here,

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:16.637
by adding the social values
there, child survival.

00:09:16.661 --> 00:09:18.389
Now I have money on that axis,

00:09:18.413 --> 00:09:21.156
and I have the possibility
of children to survive there.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.437
In some countries, 99.7% of children
survive to five years of age;

00:09:25.461 --> 00:09:27.186
others, only 70.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.478
And here, it seems,
there is a gap between OECD,

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.756
Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.665
Arab states, South Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:42.597
The linearity is very strong
between child survival and money.

00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:45.917
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:50.865
Health is there
and better health is up there.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:55.351
I can go here, and I can split
sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.

00:09:55.375 --> 00:09:56.577
And when it bursts,

00:09:56.601 --> 00:10:00.247
the size of each country bubble
is the size of the population.

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:02.811
Sierra Leone down there,
Mauritius is up there.

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.491
Mauritius was the first country
to get away with trade barriers,

00:10:06.515 --> 00:10:10.040
and they could sell their sugar,
they could sell their textiles,

00:10:10.064 --> 00:10:13.778
on equal terms as the people
in Europe and North America.

00:10:13.802 --> 00:10:15.934
There's a huge difference [within] Africa.

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.826
And Ghana is here in the middle.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.442
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.

00:10:20.466 --> 00:10:23.776
Here in Uganda, development aid.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.095
Here, time to invest;
there, you can go for a holiday.

00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:29.861
There's tremendous variation
within Africa,

00:10:29.885 --> 00:10:32.976
which we very often make
that it's equal everything.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.239
I can split South Asia here.
India's the big bubble in the middle.

00:10:37.263 --> 00:10:41.703
But there's a huge difference
between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.

00:10:41.727 --> 00:10:43.862
I can split Arab states. How are they?

00:10:43.886 --> 00:10:48.018
Same climate, same culture,
same religion -- huge difference.

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:49.264
Even between neighbors --

00:10:49.288 --> 00:10:50.533
Yemen, civil war;

00:10:50.557 --> 00:10:54.723
United Arab Emirates, money,
which was quite equally and well-used.

00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:56.529
Not as the myth is.

00:10:56.553 --> 00:11:00.662
And that includes all the children
of the foreign workers

00:11:00.686 --> 00:11:02.260
who are in the country.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:05.976
Data is often better than you think.
Many people say data is bad.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.143
There is an uncertainty margin,
but we can see the difference here:

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.529
Cambodia, Singapore.

00:11:10.553 --> 00:11:13.524
The differences are much bigger
than the weakness of the data.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:18.195
East Europe: Soviet economy
for a long time,

00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.431
but they come out after 10 years
very, very differently.

00:11:21.455 --> 00:11:24.188
And there is Latin America.

00:11:24.212 --> 00:11:25.858
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba

00:11:25.882 --> 00:11:27.910
to find a healthy country
in Latin America.

00:11:27.934 --> 00:11:32.568
Chile will have a lower child mortality
than Cuba within some few years from now.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:35.647
Here, we have high-income
countries in the OECD.

00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:39.463
And we get the whole pattern
here of the world,

00:11:39.487 --> 00:11:41.638
which is more or less like this.

00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:45.602
And if we look at it, how the world looks,

00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:49.976
in 1960, it starts to move.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.632
This is Mao Zedong.
He brought health to China.

00:11:52.656 --> 00:11:53.822
And then he died.

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:56.458
And then Deng Xiaoping came
and brought money to China,

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:58.536
and brought them
into the mainstream again.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.718
And we have seen how countries
move in different directions like this,

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:08.647
so it's sort of difficult to get
an example country

00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:10.816
which shows the pattern of the world.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.694
But I would like to bring you back
to about here, at 1960.

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:25.074
I would like to compare
South Korea, which is this one,

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:28.456
with Brazil, which is this one.

00:12:29.154 --> 00:12:30.936
The label went away for me here.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.885
And I would like to compare
Uganda, which is there.

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:37.882
I can run it forward, like this.

00:12:39.748 --> 00:12:46.744
And you can see how South Korea is making
a very, very fast advancement,

00:12:46.768 --> 00:12:49.353
whereas Brazil is much slower.

00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:55.521
And if we move back again, here,
and we put trails on them, like this,

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:57.948
you can see again

00:12:57.972 --> 00:13:01.304
that the speed of development
is very, very different,

00:13:01.328 --> 00:13:07.088
and the countries are moving
more or less at the same rate

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:08.539
as money and health,

00:13:08.563 --> 00:13:10.492
but it seems you can move much faster

00:13:10.516 --> 00:13:13.434
if you are healthy first
than if you are wealthy first.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.158
And to show that, you can put
on the way of United Arab Emirates.

00:13:18.182 --> 00:13:20.856
They came from here, a mineral country.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.347
They cached all the oil;
they got all the money;

00:13:23.371 --> 00:13:25.807
but health cannot be bought
at the supermarket.

00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:29.663
You have to invest in health.
You have to get kids into schooling.

00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:32.877
You have to train health staff.
You have to educate the population.

00:13:32.901 --> 00:13:35.257
And Sheikh Zayed did that
in a fairly good way.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:39.244
In spite of falling oil prices,
he brought this country up here.

00:13:39.268 --> 00:13:42.976
So we've got a much more mainstream
appearance of the world,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.527
where all countries tend
to use their money

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:47.846
better than they used it in the past.

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:56.247
Now, this is, more or less, if you look
at the average data of the countries --

00:13:56.271 --> 00:13:57.465
they are like this.

00:13:57.489 --> 00:14:00.898
That's dangerous, to use average data,

00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:04.767
because there is such
a lot of difference within countries.

00:14:04.791 --> 00:14:07.285
So if I go and look here,

00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:13.854
we can see that Uganda today
is where South Korea was in 1960.

00:14:13.878 --> 00:14:17.666
If I split Uganda, there's quite
a difference within Uganda.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.678
These are the quintiles of Uganda.

00:14:19.702 --> 00:14:21.882
The richest 20 percent
of Ugandans are there.

00:14:21.906 --> 00:14:23.377
The poorest are down there.

00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:26.232
If I split South Africa, it's like this.

00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:29.265
And if I go down and look at Niger,

00:14:29.289 --> 00:14:32.782
where there was such
a terrible famine [recently],

00:14:32.806 --> 00:14:33.957
it's like this.

00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:36.738
The 20 percent poorest
of Niger is out here,

00:14:36.762 --> 00:14:39.531
and the 20 percent richest
of South Africa is there,

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:43.976
and yet we tend to discuss
what solutions there should be in Africa.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.567
Everything in this world exists in Africa.

00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.866
And you can't discuss
universal access to HIV [treatment]

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.809
for that quintile up here

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:54.458
with the same strategy as down here.

00:14:54.482 --> 00:14:58.188
The improvement of the world
must be highly contextualized,

00:14:58.212 --> 00:15:01.865
and it's not relevant to have it
on a regional level.

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:03.419
We must be much more detailed.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.396
We find that students get very excited
when they can use this.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.038
And even more, policy makers
and the corporate sectors

00:15:11.062 --> 00:15:14.723
would like to see
how the world is changing.

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.622
Now, why doesn't this take place?

00:15:16.646 --> 00:15:18.949
Why are we not using the data we have?

00:15:18.973 --> 00:15:22.783
We have data in the United Nations,
in the national statistical agencies

00:15:22.807 --> 00:15:25.976
and in universities and other
nongovernmental organizations.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.737
Because the data is hidden
down in the databases.

00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:31.291
And the public is there,
and the internet is there,

00:15:31.315 --> 00:15:33.475
but we have still not used it effectively.

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:36.174
All that information
we saw changing in the world

00:15:36.198 --> 00:15:39.139
does not include
publicly funded statistics.

00:15:39.163 --> 00:15:41.534
There are some web pages
like this, you know,

00:15:41.558 --> 00:15:46.261
but they take some nourishment
down from the databases,

00:15:46.285 --> 00:15:51.257
but people put prices on them,
stupid passwords and boring statistics.

00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:52.389
(Laughter)

00:15:52.413 --> 00:15:53.835
And this won't work.

00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:56.415
(Applause)

00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:58.861
So what is needed? We have the databases.

00:15:58.885 --> 00:16:00.752
It's not a new database that you need.

00:16:00.776 --> 00:16:04.581
We have wonderful design tools
and more and more are added up here.

00:16:04.605 --> 00:16:10.735
So we started a nonprofit venture
linking data to design,

00:16:10.759 --> 00:16:11.915
we called "Gapminder,"

00:16:11.939 --> 00:16:15.036
from the London Underground,
where they warn you, "Mind the gap."

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.019
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:21.224
And we started to write software
which could link the data like this.

00:16:21.248 --> 00:16:22.795
And it wasn't that difficult.

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:26.542
It took some person years,
and we have produced animations.

00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:28.799
You can take a data set and put it there.

00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:33.299
We are liberating UN data,
some few UN organization.

00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:37.601
Some countries accept that
their databases can go out on the world.

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:40.870
But what we really need is,
of course, a search function,

00:16:40.894 --> 00:16:45.396
a search function where we can copy
the data up to a searchable format

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:46.938
and get it out in the world.

00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:49.127
And what do we hear when we go around?

00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:52.269
I've done anthropology
on the main statistical units.

00:16:52.293 --> 00:16:55.302
Everyone says, "It's impossible.
This can't be done.

00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.836
Our information is so peculiar in detail,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.964
so that cannot be searched
as others can be searched.

00:17:00.988 --> 00:17:03.343
We cannot give the data
free to the students,

00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:05.493
free to the entrepreneurs of the world."

00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:08.602
But this is what we would
like to see, isn't it?

00:17:09.175 --> 00:17:11.599
The publicly funded data is down here.

00:17:11.623 --> 00:17:14.658
And we would like flowers
to grow out on the net.

00:17:14.682 --> 00:17:17.952
One of the crucial points
is to make them searchable,

00:17:17.976 --> 00:17:22.263
and then people can use the different
design tools to animate it there.

00:17:22.287 --> 00:17:24.581
And I have pretty good news for you.

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:26.799
I have good news that the [current],

00:17:26.823 --> 00:17:30.309
new head of UN statistics
doesn't say it's impossible.

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:32.189
He only says, "We can't do it."

00:17:32.772 --> 00:17:36.304
(Laughter)

00:17:36.328 --> 00:17:38.211
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?

00:17:38.235 --> 00:17:40.084
(Laughter)

00:17:40.108 --> 00:17:44.473
So we can see a lot happening
in data in the coming years.

00:17:44.497 --> 00:17:48.873
We will be able to look at income
distributions in completely new ways.

00:17:48.897 --> 00:17:53.976
This is the income distribution
of China, 1970.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.796
This is the income distribution
of the United States, 1970.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.671
Almost no overlap.

00:18:00.695 --> 00:18:02.106
Almost no overlap.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.846
And what has happened?

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.351
What has happened is this:

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:08.347
that China is growing,
it's not so equal any longer,

00:18:08.371 --> 00:18:12.342
and it's appearing here,
overlooking the United States,

00:18:12.366 --> 00:18:14.658
almost like a ghost, isn't it?

00:18:14.682 --> 00:18:15.976
(Laughter)

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.587
It's pretty scary.

00:18:17.611 --> 00:18:19.872
(Laughter)

00:18:22.762 --> 00:18:26.672
But I think it's very important
to have all this information.

00:18:26.696 --> 00:18:29.426
We need really to see it.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.333
And instead of looking at this,

00:18:32.357 --> 00:18:37.740
I would like to end up by showing
the internet users per 1,000.

00:18:37.764 --> 00:18:40.688
In this software, we access
about 500 variables

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:42.979
from all the countries quite easily.

00:18:43.003 --> 00:18:46.137
It takes some time to change for this,

00:18:46.161 --> 00:18:51.979
but on the axes, you can quite easily
get any variable you would like to have.

00:18:52.003 --> 00:18:56.386
And the thing would be
to get up the databases free,

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.219
to get them searchable,
and with a second click,

00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:04.299
to get them into the graphic formats,
where you can instantly understand them.

00:19:04.323 --> 00:19:07.749
Now, statisticians don't like it,
because they say

00:19:07.773 --> 00:19:14.690
that this will not show the reality;

00:19:14.714 --> 00:19:17.002
we have to have statistical,
analytical methods.

00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:18.976
But this is hypothesis-generating.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.905
I end now with the world.

00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:23.506
There, the internet is coming.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.013
The number of internet users
are going up like this.

00:19:26.037 --> 00:19:28.148
This is the GDP per capita.

00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:31.672
And it's a new technology coming in,
but then amazingly,

00:19:31.696 --> 00:19:35.723
how well it fits to the economy
of the countries.

00:19:35.747 --> 00:19:38.739
That's why the $100 computer
will be so important.

00:19:38.763 --> 00:19:40.168
But it's a nice tendency.

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:42.963
It's as if the world
is flattening off, isn't it?

00:19:42.987 --> 00:19:45.525
These countries are lifting more
than the economy,

00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:48.505
and it will be very interesting
to follow this over the year,

00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:52.179
as I would like you to be able to do
with all the publicly funded data.

00:19:52.203 --> 00:19:53.385
Thank you very much.

00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:56.409
(Applause)
