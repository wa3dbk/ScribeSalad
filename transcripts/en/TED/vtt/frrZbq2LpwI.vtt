00:00:16.327 --> 00:00:19.050
So wouldn't it be amazing if our phones

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.448
could see the world in the same way that we do,

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:23.374
as we're walking around being able

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:25.573
to point a phone at anything,

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:27.668
and then have it actually recognize images and objects

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:30.438
like the human brain, and then be able to pull in information

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:33.437
from an almost infinite library of knowledge

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:35.550
and experiences and ideas.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.637
Well, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:38.787
but now we've moved to a world

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:41.118
where actually this has become possible.

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:43.713
So the best way of explaining it is to just show it.

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:45.318
What you can see over here is Tamara,

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:47.133
who is holding my phone that's now plugged in.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.069
So let me start with this.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.637
What we have here is a painting

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.893
of the great poet Rabbie Burns,

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:54.710
and it's just a normal image,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.101
but if we now switch inputs over to the phone,

00:00:57.101 --> 00:00:59.326
running our technology, you can see

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.668
effectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:03.221
and when she points at this image,

00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:05.438
something magical happens.

00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:09.800
(Laughter) (Bagpipes)

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.408
(Bagpipes) (Applause)

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:19.288
(Bagpipes)

00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:21.086
Voice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:22.711
Matt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,

00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:24.523
there's no trickery here.

00:01:24.523 --> 00:01:27.159
There's nothing done to this image.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.184
And what's great about this is the technology's

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:32.759
actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.889
much like how the human brain does.

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.392
Not only that, but as I move the object around,

00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:43.431
it's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:45.468
Again, the thing that's incredible about this is

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:47.654
this is how advanced these devices have become.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:49.782
All the processing to do that was actually done

00:01:49.782 --> 00:01:52.248
on the device itself.

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:54.299
Now, this has applications everywhere,

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.014
whether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,

00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:01.269
or in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:04.670
So a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.662
And here is this morning's newspaper,

00:02:06.662 --> 00:02:08.840
and we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.805
Now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper

00:02:11.805 --> 00:02:13.901
and immediately get the bulletin.

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.132
Voice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt

00:02:17.132 --> 00:02:19.528
and you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing

00:02:19.528 --> 00:02:22.049
to change direction at a split second,

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.031
and she does all that. She's won this title.

00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:28.216
MM: And that linking of the digital content

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:30.645
to something that's physical is what we call an aura, and

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:33.012
I'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:36.304
So, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,

00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:39.124
more convenient way to get information in the real world,

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:41.643
but there are times when actually using this medium

00:02:41.643 --> 00:02:43.975
allows you to be able to display information in a way

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.090
that was never before possible.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.929
So what I have here is a wireless router.

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.194
My American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:54.014
so that everyone here&nbsp;understands — (Laughter) —

00:02:54.014 --> 00:02:57.459
but nonetheless, here is the device.

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.529
So now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:03.135
for the device online, I can simply point at it,

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:07.707
the device is recognized, and then --

00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:10.819
Voice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.290
Then connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.646
Congratulations. You have now completed setup.

00:03:19.646 --> 00:03:21.812
(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:24.922
(Applause)

00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:27.900
The incredible work that made that possible was done

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.738
here in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:32.523
and they work in our offices,

00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:34.051
and I've got a lovely picture of them here.

00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:35.810
They couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.508
bring their aura to the stage, so here they are.

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:45.139
They're not very animated. (Laughter)

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.407
This was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)

00:03:49.407 --> 00:03:52.872
Okay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,

00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:55.233
let's now move on to technical advancements,

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:57.400
because since we started putting this technology

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.515
on mobile phones less than 12 months ago,

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:03.569
the speed and the processing in these devices

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.969
has grown at a really phenomenal rate,

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.223
and that means that I can now take cinema-quality

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:11.433
3D models and place them in the world around me,

00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:13.617
so I have one over here.

00:04:13.617 --> 00:04:17.302
Tamara, would you like to jump in?

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.854
(Music)

00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:26.861
(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)

00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.038
MM: I should leap in.

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:32.815
(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:37.964
(Applause)

00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:40.404
So then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side

00:04:40.404 --> 00:04:42.860
of what we do, because effectively, this technology

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.252
allows you to see the world through someone's eyes,

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:48.165
and for that person to be able to take a moment in time

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:51.298
and effectively store it and tag it to something physical

00:04:51.298 --> 00:04:53.275
that exists in the real world.

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.796
What's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:58.924
They're open, they're available to everyone within our application,

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:02.606
and educators have really got on board with the classrooms.

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:04.980
So we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.020
teachers who've tagged up school classrooms,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.193
and a great example of this is a school in the U.K.

00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:12.201
I have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.

00:05:13.632 --> 00:05:21.372
Teacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.

00:05:21.372 --> 00:05:25.285
Child: TV. (Children react)

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:26.665
Child: Oh my God.

00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:29.219
Teacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.631
Move away from it and come back to it.

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:35.776
Child: Oh, that is so cool.

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:38.663
Teacher: And then, have you got it again?

00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:43.071
Child: Oh my God! How did you do that?

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:45.803
Second child: It's magic.

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:49.376
(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:51.143
It's available for everyone to do,

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:53.028
and actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:54.317
by doing one right now.

00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:57.073
So, as sort of — I'm told it's called a stadium wave,

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:58.390
so we're going to start from this side of the room

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.340
on the count of three, and go over to here.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.723
Tamara, are you recording?

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:03.607
Okay, so are you all ready?

00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:05.806
One, two, three. Go!

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:09.431
Audience: Whooooooo!

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:12.865
MM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:14.562
Okay. Now we're going to switch back

00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:16.383
into the Aurasma application,

00:06:16.383 --> 00:06:19.768
and what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just

00:06:19.768 --> 00:06:25.807
took onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.

00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:29.112
Now, we have lots of people who are doing this already,

00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:31.370
and we've talked a little bit about the educational side.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.520
On the emotional side, we have people who've

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.592
done things like send postcards and Christmas cards

00:06:36.592 --> 00:06:39.818
back to their family with little messages on them.

00:06:39.818 --> 00:06:42.047
We have people who have, for example,

00:06:42.047 --> 00:06:44.104
taken the inside of the engine bay of an old car

00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:46.569
and tagged up different components within an engine,

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.848
so that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:51.409
you can point and discover the information.

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:54.479
We're all very, very familiar with the Internet.

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.329
In the last 20 years, it's really

00:06:57.329 --> 00:06:59.223
changed the way that we live and work,

00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:02.255
and the way that we see the world, and what's great is,

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.569
we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:07.976
because now we can literally take the content

00:07:07.976 --> 00:07:11.172
that we share, we discover, and that we enjoy

00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:13.544
and make it a part of the world around us.

00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:15.370
It's completely free to download this application.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.104
If you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.369
this process is very, very quick.

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:21.282
Oh, there we are. We can save it now.

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:23.518
It's just going to do a tiny bit of processing

00:07:23.518 --> 00:07:25.639
to convert that image that we just took

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.543
into a sort of digital fingerprint,

00:07:27.543 --> 00:07:29.576
and the great thing is, if you're a professional user,

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:32.256
-- so, a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical

00:07:32.256 --> 00:07:34.750
to what we've just used to create this demonstration.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.462
The only difference is that you've got the ability

00:07:36.462 --> 00:07:39.139
to add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:40.191
Tamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.

00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:42.397
MM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means

00:07:42.397 --> 00:07:44.816
we can now point at the image, and there you all are.

00:07:44.816 --> 00:07:51.211
MM on video: One, two, three. Go!

00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:53.560
MM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.194
(Applause)
