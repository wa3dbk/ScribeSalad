00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.472
I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:20.589
The question is,

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.873
Why is it that the letter X

00:00:22.873 --> 00:00:24.871
represents the unknown?

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.838
Now I know we learned that in math class,

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:29.589
but now it's everywhere in the culture --

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.390
The X prize, the X-Files,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.313
Project X, TEDx.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:38.308
Where'd that come from?

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:39.526
About six years ago

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:42.242
I decided that I would learn Arabic,

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:46.194
which turns out to be a supremely logical language.

00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:48.511
To write a word or a phrase

00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.192
or a sentence in Arabic

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:52.425
is like crafting an equation,

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:54.791
because every part is extremely precise

00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:57.643
and carries a lot of information.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:00:58.993
That's one of the reasons

00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:00.508
so much of what we've come to think of

00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:04.327
as Western science and mathematics and engineering

00:01:04.327 --> 00:01:07.649
was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.965
by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.282
This includes the little system in Arabic

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:14.998
called al-jebra.

00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:18.166
And al-jebr roughly translates to

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.865
"the system for reconciling disparate parts."

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:25.915
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.082
One example among many.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:32.048
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:33.831
finally made their way to Europe --

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:35.117
which is to say Spain --

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:37.582
in the 11th and 12th centuries.

00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:38.732
And when they arrived

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.615
there was tremendous interest

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:42.349
in translating this wisdom

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:43.998
into a European language.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:46.016
But there were problems.

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:47.733
One problem

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.366
is there are some sounds in Arabic

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.365
that just don't make it through a European voice box

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:55.632
without lots of practice.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.366
Trust me on that one.

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.583
Also, those very sounds

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.497
tend not to be represented

00:02:01.497 --> 00:02:05.085
by the characters that are available in European languages.

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:06.899
Here's one of the culprits.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.783
This is the letter sheen,

00:02:08.783 --> 00:02:12.382
and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- "sh."

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.984
It's also the very first letter

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.416
of the word shayun,

00:02:17.416 --> 00:02:19.210
which means "something"

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.058
just like the the English word "something" --

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:24.344
some undefined, unknown thing.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.509
Now in Arabic,

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.710
we can make this definite

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.858
by adding the definite article "al."

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:31.460
So this is al-shayun --

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.110
the unknown thing.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.413
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:43.613
such as this 10th-century derivation of roots.

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:46.123
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:48.691
who were tasked with translating this material

00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:53.173
is that the letter sheen and the word shayun

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.123
can't be rendered into Spanish

00:02:55.123 --> 00:02:57.709
because Spanish doesn't have that SH,

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.006
that "sh" sound.

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.588
So by convention,

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:02.254
they created a rule in which

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:06.472
they borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound,

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:08.220
from the classical Greek

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.901
in the form of the letter Kai.

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.620
Later when this material was translated

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.968
into a common European language,

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:18.018
which is to say Latin,

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.051
they simply replaced the Greek Kai

00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.401
with the Latin X.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.670
And once that happened,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.135
once this material was in Latin,

00:03:26.135 --> 00:03:29.718
it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks

00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.801
for almost 600 years.

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:33.819
But now we have the answer to our question.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.600
Why is it that X is the unknown?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.423
X is the unknown

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:42.205
because you can't say "sh" in Spanish.

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:44.589
(Laughter)

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.906
And I thought that was worth sharing.

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:50.023
(Applause)
