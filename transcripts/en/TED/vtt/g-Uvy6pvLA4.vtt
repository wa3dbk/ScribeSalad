00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.458
Two years ago, I have to say there was no problem.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:19.516
Two years ago, I knew exactly 
what an icon looked like.

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.871
It looks like this.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.700
Everybody's icon, but also the default position

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.523
of a curator of Italian Renaissance 
paintings, which I was then.

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:32.215
And in a way, this is also another default selection.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:36.762
Leonardo da Vinci's exquisitely soulful image

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:38.062
of the "Lady with an Ermine."

00:00:38.062 --> 00:00:40.605
And I use that word, soulful, deliberately.

00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.988
Or then there's this, or rather these:

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:45.642
the two versions of Leonardo's "Virgin of the Rocks"

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:49.918
that were about to come together 
in London for the very first time.

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:54.102
In the exhibition that I was then in 
the absolute throes of organizing.

00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:57.539
I was literally up to my eyes in Leonardo,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.357
and I had been for three years.

00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:03.779
So, he was occupying every part of my brain.

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:06.620
Leonardo had taught me, during that three years,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.468
about what a picture can do.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:13.786
About taking you from your own 
material world into a spiritual world.

00:01:13.786 --> 00:01:16.677
He said, actually, that he believed 
the job of the painter

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:21.128
was to paint everything that was visible 
and invisible in the universe.

00:01:21.128 --> 00:01:25.125
That's a huge task. And yet, 
somehow he achieves it.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.896
He shows us, I think, the human soul.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:32.342
He shows us the capacity of ourselves

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:35.770
to move into a spiritual realm.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.298
To see a vision of the universe that's 
more perfect than our own.

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:43.874
To see God's own plan, in some sense.

00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:47.945
So this, in a sense, was really 
what I believed an icon was.

00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:51.803
At about that time, I started talking to Tom Campbell,

00:01:51.803 --> 00:01:54.354
director here of the Metropolitan Museum,

00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:57.678
about what my next move might be.

00:01:57.678 --> 00:02:00.449
The move, in fact, back to an earlier life,

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:02.407
one I'd begun at the British Museum,

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.926
back to the world of three dimensions --

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:07.158
of sculpture and of decorative arts --

00:02:07.158 --> 00:02:11.376
to take over the department of European sculpture 
and decorative arts, here at the Met.

00:02:11.376 --> 00:02:12.816
But it was an incredibly busy time.

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:16.223
All the conversations were done 
at very peculiar times of the day --

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:19.136
over the phone.

00:02:19.136 --> 00:02:21.200
In the end, I accepted the job

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.573
without actually having been here.

00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:25.125
Again, I'd been there a couple of years before,

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.637
but on that particular visit.

00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:31.729
So, it was just before the time that 
the Leonardo show was due to open

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.751
when I finally made it back to the Met, to New York,

00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.207
to see my new domain.

00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:41.150
To see what European sculpture 
and decorative arts looked like,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.941
beyond those Renaissance collections 
with which I was so already familiar.

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:48.938
And I thought, on that very first day, 
I better tour the galleries.

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:50.390
Fifty-seven of these galleries --

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.246
like 57 varieties of baked beans, I believe.

00:02:55.246 --> 00:03:01.367
I walked through and I started in my comfort zone
in the Italian Renaissance.

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:03.288
And then I moved gradually around,

00:03:03.288 --> 00:03:06.390
feeling a little lost sometimes.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.443
My head, also still full of the Leonardo exhibition

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:13.465
that was about to open, and I came across this.

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:21.395
And I thought to myself: What the hell have I done?

00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:24.748
There was absolutely no connection in my mind

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:27.847
at all and, in fact, if there was any emotion going on,

00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:30.216
it was a kind of repulsion.

00:03:30.216 --> 00:03:33.454
This object felt utterly and completely alien.

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:38.917
Silly at a level that I hadn't yet 
understood silliness to be.

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.116
And then it was made worse --

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:42.961
there were two of them.

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:46.100
(Laughter)

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.067
So, I started thinking about why it was, in fact,

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:51.523
that I disliked this object so much.

00:03:51.523 --> 00:03:55.329
What was the anatomy of my distaste?

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.797
Well, so much gold, so vulgar.

00:03:58.797 --> 00:04:02.651
You know, so nouveau riche, frankly.

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.564
Leonardo himself had preached 
against the use of gold,

00:04:05.564 --> 00:04:08.999
so it was absolutely anathema at that moment.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:14.427
And then there's little pretty sprigs 
of flowers everywhere. (Laughter)

00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:17.946
And finally, that pink. That damned pink.

00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:20.842
It's such an extraordinarily artificial color.

00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:24.370
I mean, it's a color that I can't think of 
anything that you actually see in nature,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.458
that looks that shade.

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.198
The object even has its own tutu. (Laughter)

00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:33.558
This little flouncy, spangly, bottomy bit

00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:35.593
that sits at the bottom of the vase.

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:37.966
It reminded me, in an odd kind of way,

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:40.065
of my niece's fifth birthday party.

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:44.587
Where all the little girls would come 
either as a princess or a fairy.

00:04:44.587 --> 00:04:46.468
There was one who would come as a fairy princess.

00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:48.890
You should have seen the looks.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.583
(Laughter)

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:53.925
And I realize that this object was in my mind,

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:56.865
born from the same mind, from the same womb,

00:04:56.865 --> 00:05:02.089
practically, as Barbie Ballerina. (Laughter)

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.611
And then there's the elephants. (Laughter)

00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:07.757
Those extraordinary elephants

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:10.481
with their little, sort of strange, sinister expressions

00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.778
and Greta Garbo eyelashes, with 
these golden tusks and so on.

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:17.554
I realized this was an elephant that had

00:05:17.554 --> 00:05:23.287
absolutely nothing to do with a majestic 
march across the Serengeti.

00:05:23.287 --> 00:05:28.782
It was a Dumbo nightmare. (Laughter)

00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:31.628
But something more profound 
was happening as well.

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.057
These objects, it seemed to me,

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:37.366
were quintessentially the kind that I 
and my liberal left friends in London

00:05:37.366 --> 00:05:39.901
had always seen as summing up

00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:42.740
something deplorable about the French aristocracy

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.912
in the 18th century.

00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.701
The label had told me that these pieces were made

00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:50.412
by the Sèvres Manufactory,

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:53.637
made of porcelain in the late 1750s,

00:05:53.637 --> 00:05:56.768
and designed by a designer called 
Jean-Claude Duplessis,

00:05:56.768 --> 00:05:58.964
actually somebody of extraordinary distinction

00:05:58.964 --> 00:06:01.441
as I later learned.

00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:06.249
But for me, they summed up a kind of,

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.663
that sort of sheer uselessness of the aristocracy

00:06:09.663 --> 00:06:13.136
in the 18th century.

00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:15.602
I and my colleagues had always thought

00:06:15.602 --> 00:06:18.558
that these objects, in way, summed up the idea of,

00:06:18.558 --> 00:06:20.922
you know -- no wonder there was a revolution.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:25.465
Or, indeed, thank God there was a revolution.

00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:27.224
There was a sort of idea really, that,

00:06:27.224 --> 00:06:29.897
if you owned a vase like this,

00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:33.621
then there was really only one fate possible.

00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:37.685
(Laughter)

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:42.349
So, there I was -- in a sort of paroxysm of horror.

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.309
But I took the job and I went 
on looking at these vases.

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.840
I sort of had to because they're 
on a through route in the Met.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.472
So, almost anywhere I went, there they were.

00:06:52.472 --> 00:06:55.241
They had this kind of odd sort of fascination,

00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:58.259
like a car accident.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.983
Where I couldn't stop looking.

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:03.205
And as I did so, I started thinking:

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:07.733
Well, what are we actually looking at here?

00:07:07.733 --> 00:07:11.064
And what I started with was understanding this

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:14.616
as really a supreme piece of design.

00:07:14.616 --> 00:07:15.713
It took me a little time.

00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:17.151
But, that tutu for example --

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.273
actually, this is a piece that 
does dance in its own way.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.915
It has an extraordinary lightness

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:24.430
and yet, it is also amazing balanced.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.905
It has these kinds of sculptural ingredients.

00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:29.544
And then the play between --

00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:34.156
actually really quite carefully disposed 
color and gilding, and the sculptural surface,

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:36.431
is really rather remarkable.

00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:39.261
And then I realized that this piece went into the kiln

00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:42.651
four times, at least four times 
in order to arrive at this.

00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.705
How many moments for accident can you think of

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:47.209
that could have happened to this piece?

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:49.771
And then remember, not just one, but two.

00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:54.036
So he's having to arrive at two exactly matched

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.548
vases of this kind.

00:07:56.548 --> 00:07:57.954
And then this question of uselessness.

00:07:57.954 --> 00:08:02.913
Well actually, the end of the trunks 
were originally candle holders.

00:08:02.913 --> 00:08:06.663
So what you would have had 
were candles on either side.

00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:09.219
Imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface.

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:11.951
On the slightly uneven pink, on the beautiful gold.

00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:14.697
It would have glittered in an interior,

00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:17.779
a little like a little firework.

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:21.431
And at that point, actually, 
a firework went off in my brain.

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:24.266
Somebody reminded me that, that word 'fancy' --

00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:27.376
which in a sense for me, encapsulated this object --

00:08:27.376 --> 00:08:31.422
actually comes from the same 
root as the word 'fantasy.'

00:08:31.422 --> 00:08:34.038
And that what this object was just as much in a way,

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:36.490
in its own way, as a Leonardo da Vinci painting,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.697
is a portal to somewhere else.

00:08:38.697 --> 00:08:42.892
This is an object of the imagination.

00:08:42.892 --> 00:08:49.701
If you think about the mad 18th-century 
operas of the time -- set in the Orient.

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:56.200
If you think about divans and perhaps even 
opium-induced visions of pink elephants,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.501
then at that point, this object starts to make sense.

00:08:59.501 --> 00:09:03.557
This is an object which is all about escapism.

00:09:03.557 --> 00:09:06.754
It's about an escapism that happens --

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:08.775
that the aristocracy in France sought

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:10.561
very deliberately

00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:15.129
to distinguish themselves from ordinary people.

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:17.093
It's not an escapism that

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:20.960
we feel particularly happy with today, however.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.945
And again, going on thinking about this,

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:27.119
I realize that in a way we're all victims

00:09:27.119 --> 00:09:29.130
of a certain kind of tyranny

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.151
of the triumph of modernism

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:33.877
whereby form and function in an object

00:09:33.877 --> 00:09:37.282
have to follow one another, or are deemed to do so.

00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:40.246
And the extraneous ornament is seen as really,

00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:43.266
essentially, criminal.

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:46.417
It's a triumph, in a way, of bourgeois
values rather than aristocratic ones.

00:09:46.417 --> 00:09:48.240
And that seems fine.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.697
Except for the fact that it becomes a kind of 
sequestration of imagination.

00:09:55.697 --> 00:09:58.387
So just as in the 20th century, so many people

00:09:58.387 --> 00:10:00.375
had the idea that their faith

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.057
took place on the Sabbath day,

00:10:03.057 --> 00:10:04.431
and the rest of their lives --

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.409
their lives of washing machines and orthodontics --

00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.441
took place on another day.

00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:14.209
Then, I think we've started doing the same.

00:10:14.209 --> 00:10:17.541
We've allowed ourselves to

00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:19.898
lead our fantasy lives in front of screens.

00:10:19.898 --> 00:10:23.880
In the dark of the cinema, with the
television in the corner of the room.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.958
We've eliminated, in a sense, that constant

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:32.886
of the imagination that these vases 
represented in people's lives.

00:10:32.886 --> 00:10:36.922
So maybe it's time we got this back a little.

00:10:36.922 --> 00:10:39.272
I think it's beginning to happen.

00:10:39.272 --> 00:10:40.538
In London, for example,

00:10:40.538 --> 00:10:42.687
with these extraordinary buildings

00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:45.678
that have been appearing over the last few years.

00:10:45.678 --> 00:10:48.081
Redolent, in a sense, of science fiction,

00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:50.195
turning London into a kind of fantasy playground.

00:10:50.195 --> 00:10:55.049
It's actually amazing to look out of 
a high building nowadays there.

00:10:55.049 --> 00:10:56.853
But even then, there's a resistance.

00:10:56.853 --> 00:11:01.189
London has called these buildings the 
Gherkin, the Shard, the Walkie Talkie --

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:04.494
bringing these soaring buildings down to Earth.

00:11:04.494 --> 00:11:08.574
There's an idea that we don't want these

00:11:08.574 --> 00:11:13.435
anxious-making, imaginative journeys 
to happen in our daily lives.

00:11:13.435 --> 00:11:16.703
I feel lucky in a way,

00:11:16.703 --> 00:11:19.251
I've encountered this object.

00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:21.692
(Laughter)

00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:24.994
I found him on the Internet when 
I was looking up a reference.

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:27.888
And there he was.

00:11:27.888 --> 00:11:31.202
And unlike the pink elephant vase,

00:11:31.202 --> 00:11:33.175
this was a kind of love at first sight.

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:36.031
In fact, reader, I married him. I bought him.

00:11:36.031 --> 00:11:39.895
And he now adorns my office.

00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:43.436
He's a Staffordshire figure made 
in the middle of the 19th century.

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:48.242
He represents the actor, Edmund Kean, 
playing Shakespeare's Richard III.

00:11:48.242 --> 00:11:50.695
And it's based, actually, on a more 
elevated piece of porcelain.

00:11:50.695 --> 00:11:52.849
So I loved, on an art historical level,

00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:57.509
I loved that layered quality that he has.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.002
But more than that, I love him.

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:01.680
In a way that I think would have been impossible

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.292
without the pink Sèvres vase in my Leonardo days.

00:12:04.292 --> 00:12:07.509
I love his orange and pink breeches.

00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:10.259
I love the fact that he seems to be going off to war,

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:14.691
having just finished the washing up. (Laughter)

00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:17.168
He seems also to have forgotten his sword.

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.787
I love his pink little cheeks, his munchkin energy.

00:12:19.787 --> 00:12:22.978
In a way, he's become my sort of alter ego.

00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:25.279
He's, I hope, a little bit dignified,

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:30.453
but mostly rather vulgar. (Laughter)

00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:33.671
And energetic, I hope, too.

00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:38.826
I let him into my life because the Sèvres
pink elephant vase allowed me to do so.

00:12:38.826 --> 00:12:40.394
And before that Leonardo,

00:12:40.394 --> 00:12:45.500
I understood that this object could become 
part of a journey for me every day,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.245
sitting in my office.

00:12:48.245 --> 00:12:51.234
I really hope that others, all of you,

00:12:51.234 --> 00:12:52.809
visiting objects in the museum,

00:12:52.809 --> 00:12:55.263
and taking them home and 
finding them for yourselves,

00:12:55.263 --> 00:12:59.577
will allow those objects to flourish 
in your imaginative lives.

00:12:59.577 --> 00:13:01.130
Thank you very much.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.013
(Applause)
