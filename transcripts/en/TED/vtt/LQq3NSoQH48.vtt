00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:14.820
The first time

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:16.844
I felt fear

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:19.104
I was 41 years old.

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:22.916
People have always said I was brave.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.118
When I was little,
I'd climb the highest tree,

00:00:26.142 --> 00:00:28.662
and I'd approach any animal fearlessly.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.376
I liked challenges.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:33.440
My father used to say,

00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:39.046
"Good steel can withstand
any temperature."

00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:43.156
And when I entered into
Colombian politics,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.746
I thought I'd be able
to withstand any temperature.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.941
I wanted to end corruption;

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:53.144
I wanted to cut ties between politicians
and drug traffickers.

00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:55.826
The first time I was elected,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.533
it was because I called out, by name,

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:01.578
corrupt and untouchable politicians.

00:01:02.172 --> 00:01:04.518
I also called out the president

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:08.298
for his ties to the cartels.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.587
That's when the threats started.

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:17.781
I had to send my very young children
out of the country one morning,

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:21.967
hidden, all the way to the airport,
in the French ambassador's armored car.

00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:23.805
Days later,

00:01:24.742 --> 00:01:27.365
I was the victim of an attack,
but emerged unharmed.

00:01:28.944 --> 00:01:30.267
The following year,

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.642
the Colombian people elected me
with the highest number of votes.

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:39.238
I thought people applauded me
because I was brave.

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.351
I, too, thought I was brave.

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:44.683
But I wasn't.

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:50.266
I had simply never before experienced

00:01:50.905 --> 00:01:53.145
true fear.

00:01:54.557 --> 00:01:55.733
That changed

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.447
on February 23, 2002.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.346
At the time, I was a presidential
candidate in Colombia

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:08.377
promoting my campaign agenda,

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.634
when I was detained
by a group of armed men.

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:15.037
They were wearing uniforms
with military garments.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.163
I looked at their boots; they were rubber.

00:02:19.187 --> 00:02:20.596
And I knew

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.921
that the Colombian army
wore leather boots.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.441
I knew that these were FARC guerrillas.

00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:30.798
From that point on,
everything happened very quickly.

00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:36.963
The commando leader ordered us
to stop the vehicle.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.022
Meanwhile, one of his men
stepped on an antipersonnel mine

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.828
and flew through the air.

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:47.574
He landed, sitting upright,

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:49.905
right in front of me.

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.929
We made eye contact

00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:55.190
and it was then
that the young man understood:

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:58.729
his rubber boot with his leg still in it

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:00.198
had landed far away.

00:03:01.744 --> 00:03:02.934
(Sighs)

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.054
He started

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.942
screaming like crazy.

00:03:12.972 --> 00:03:14.141
And the truth is,

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:20.960
I felt -- as I feel right now,
because I'm reliving these emotions --

00:03:20.984 --> 00:03:24.617
I felt at that moment
that something inside of me was breaking

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.443
and that I was being infected
with his fear.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.331
My mind went blank and couldn't think;

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:32.530
it was paralyzed.

00:03:33.243 --> 00:03:34.936
When I finally reacted,

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.338
I said to myself,

00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:39.993
"They're going to kill me,

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:43.469
and I didn't say goodbye to my children."

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:50.851
As they took me into
the deepest depths of the jungle,

00:03:52.796 --> 00:03:54.403
the FARC soldiers announced

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.169
that if the government didn't negotiate,

00:03:58.406 --> 00:03:59.650
they'd kill me.

00:04:00.674 --> 00:04:02.424
And I knew

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.421
that the government wouldn't negotiate.

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:09.168
From that point on,

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.990
I went to sleep in fear every night --

00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:14.434
cold sweats,

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.322
shaking,

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:19.187
stomach ache,

00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:20.468
insomnia.

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:24.373
But worse than that
was what was happening to my mind,

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:28.896
because my memory was being erased:
all the phone numbers,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.407
addresses,

00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.500
names of very dear people,

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:36.203
even significant life events.

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:39.708
And so,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.394
I began to doubt myself,
to doubt my mental health.

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:47.835
And with doubt came desperation,

00:04:48.565 --> 00:04:50.659
and with desperation came depression.

00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:54.565
I was suffering notorious
behavioral changes

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.216
and it wasn't just paranoia
in moments of panic.

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.731
It was distrust,

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:03.942
it was hatred,

00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:06.637
and it was also the urge to kill.

00:05:07.574 --> 00:05:09.841
This, I realized

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:14.426
when they had me
chained by the neck to a tree.

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:19.054
They kept me outside that day,

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:21.821
during a tropical downpour.

00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:28.358
I remember feeling an urgent need
to use the bathroom.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:34.369
"Whatever you have to do,

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:38.616
you'll do in front of me,

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.695
bitch,"

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:52.410
the guard screamed at me.

00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:02.282
And I

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.406
decided at that moment

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.893
to kill him.

00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:24.823
And for days,

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:30.539
I was planning, trying to find
the right moment, the right way to do it,

00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:32.048
filled with hatred,

00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:33.246
filled with fear.

00:06:33.984 --> 00:06:35.776
Then suddenly,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.060
I rose up,

00:06:37.084 --> 00:06:38.432
snapped out of it

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:40.422
and thought:

00:06:41.405 --> 00:06:43.509
"I'm not going to become one of them.

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.533
I'm not going to become an assassin.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.788
I still have enough freedom

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:54.165
to decide

00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:56.721
who I want to be."

00:06:59.832 --> 00:07:01.645
That's when I learned that fear

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:06.134
brought me face to face with myself.

00:07:07.047 --> 00:07:08.230
It forced me

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:11.674
to align my energies,

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.266
to align my meridians.

00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:18.034
I learned that facing fear

00:07:19.717 --> 00:07:23.249
could become a pathway to growth.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.248
A lot of emotions arise
when I talk about all of this,

00:07:28.938 --> 00:07:31.125
but when I think back,

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.051
I'm able to identify

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:37.437
the steps I took to do it.

00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:41.494
I want to share three of them with you.

00:07:41.518 --> 00:07:43.592
The first

00:07:45.383 --> 00:07:47.483
was to be guided by principles.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:49.604
Because I realized

00:07:49.628 --> 00:07:52.444
that in the midst of panic
and mental block,

00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:56.610
if I followed my principles,

00:07:56.634 --> 00:07:58.313
I acted correctly.

00:08:00.265 --> 00:08:03.436
I remember the first night

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.308
in a concentration camp
that the guerrillas had built

00:08:07.332 --> 00:08:08.670
in the middle of the jungle,

00:08:09.448 --> 00:08:12.802
with 12-foot-high bars,

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.431
barbed wire,

00:08:14.455 --> 00:08:16.795
lookouts in the four corners

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:20.191
and armed men pointing
guns at us 24 hours a day.

00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:23.479
That morning, the first morning,

00:08:24.678 --> 00:08:27.385
some men arrived, yelling:

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:29.242
"Count off! Count off!"

00:08:30.567 --> 00:08:34.746
My fellow hostages woke up, startled,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.098
and began to identify themselves
in numbered sequence.

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:40.288
But when it was my turn,

00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:42.885
I said,

00:08:43.858 --> 00:08:45.203
"Ingrid Betancourt.

00:08:45.227 --> 00:08:48.265
If you want to know if I'm here,
call me by my name."

00:08:49.386 --> 00:08:51.385
The guards' fury

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:55.137
was nothing compared
to that of the other hostages,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.915
because, obviously they were scared --

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:00.348
we were all scared --

00:09:00.372 --> 00:09:03.782
and they were afraid that, because of me,
they would be punished.

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:05.747
But for me,

00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:12.432
beyond fear was the need
to defend my identity,

00:09:12.456 --> 00:09:16.003
to not let them turn me into
a thing or a number.

00:09:16.027 --> 00:09:17.597
That was one of the principles:

00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:20.138
to defend

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:23.856
what I considered to be human dignity.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:27.180
But make no mistake:

00:09:27.204 --> 00:09:29.204
the guerrillas had it all

00:09:30.534 --> 00:09:32.181
very well analyzed --

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:34.396
they had been kidnapping for years,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.897
and they had developed a technique

00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:40.470
to break us,

00:09:40.494 --> 00:09:42.254
to defeat us, to divide us.

00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:44.062
And so,

00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:46.370
the second step

00:09:47.977 --> 00:09:50.984
was to learn how to build
supportive trust,

00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:53.412
to learn how to unite.

00:09:55.268 --> 00:09:58.351
The jungle is like a different planet.

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:02.118
It's a world

00:10:04.023 --> 00:10:06.366
of shadows, of rain,

00:10:07.937 --> 00:10:12.527
with the hum of millions of bugs --

00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:14.756
majiña ants, bullet ants.

00:10:15.496 --> 00:10:18.771
I didn't stop scratching a single day
while I was in the jungle.

00:10:21.032 --> 00:10:25.619
And of course, there were tarantulas,
scorpions, anacondas ...

00:10:25.643 --> 00:10:29.846
I once came face to face
with a 24-foot long anaconda

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.024
that could have swallowed me in one bite.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:33.230
Jaguars ...

00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:35.921
But I want to tell you

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:39.992
that none of these animals
did us as much harm

00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:42.058
as the human beings.

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:49.205
The guerrillas terrorized us.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:52.848
They spread rumors.

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:56.408
Among the hostages,
they sparked betrayals,

00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:58.555
jealousy,

00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:00.404
resentment,

00:11:01.135 --> 00:11:02.386
mistrust.

00:11:03.595 --> 00:11:10.069
The first time I escaped
for a long time was with Lucho.

00:11:10.093 --> 00:11:12.902
Lucho had been a hostage
for two years longer than I had.

00:11:13.557 --> 00:11:16.589
We decided to tie ourselves up

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.157
with ropes

00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:23.598
to have the strength
to lower ourselves into that dark water

00:11:23.622 --> 00:11:26.646
full of piranhas and alligators.

00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:32.742
What we did was, during the day,
we would hide in the mangroves.

00:11:33.702 --> 00:11:35.369
And at night,

00:11:35.393 --> 00:11:37.446
we would leave, get in the water,

00:11:38.377 --> 00:11:41.612
and we would swim
and let the current carry us.

00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:44.972
That went on for several days.

00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:47.392
But Lucho

00:11:49.004 --> 00:11:50.362
became sick.

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:51.700
He was diabetic,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.089
and he fell into a diabetic coma.

00:11:55.148 --> 00:11:59.356
So the guerrillas captured us.

00:12:00.618 --> 00:12:03.839
But after having lived
through that with Lucho,

00:12:04.702 --> 00:12:07.378
after having faced fear together, united,

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:11.919
not punishment, not violence -- nothing --

00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:16.025
could ever again divide us.

00:12:19.128 --> 00:12:20.914
What's certain is,

00:12:20.938 --> 00:12:24.734
all the guerrillas' manipulation
was so damaging to us

00:12:26.057 --> 00:12:27.839
that even today,

00:12:28.888 --> 00:12:30.888
among some of the hostages

00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.888
from back then,

00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.096
tensions linger,

00:12:38.104 --> 00:12:41.579
passed down from all that poison

00:12:43.586 --> 00:12:45.586
that the guerrillas created.

00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:49.047
The third step

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:52.856
is very important to me,

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.240
and it's a gift
that I want to give to you.

00:12:56.163 --> 00:13:00.725
The third step is to learn
how to develop faith.

00:13:02.994 --> 00:13:06.761
I want to explain it like this:

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.065
Jhon Frank Pinchao

00:13:09.929 --> 00:13:12.257
was a police officer

00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:14.701
who had been a hostage
for more than eight years.

00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:19.291
He was famous for being
the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.

00:13:22.163 --> 00:13:24.918
But Pincho -- I called him "Pincho" --

00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:29.597
Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.

00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:31.555
And he asked me to help him.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:35.084
By that point, I basically had
a master's degree in escape attempts.

00:13:35.108 --> 00:13:36.533
(Laughter)

00:13:37.012 --> 00:13:38.244
So

00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:41.749
we got started but we had a delay,

00:13:41.773 --> 00:13:44.432
because first, Pincho
had to learn how to swim.

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:50.149
And we had to carry out
all these preparations in total secrecy.

00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:54.233
Anyway, when we finally
had everything ready,

00:13:54.257 --> 00:13:58.427
Pincho came up to me
one afternoon and said,

00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:01.610
"Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,

00:14:01.634 --> 00:14:05.255
and I go around and around in circles,
and I can't find the way out.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:06.449
What do I do?"

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.023
"Pincho,

00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:11.878
you grab a phone,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.679
and you call the man upstairs."

00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:18.958
"Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God."

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:26.286
"God doesn't care. He'll still help you."

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:32.177
(Applause)

00:14:35.447 --> 00:14:37.968
It rained all night that night.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:40.505
The following morning,

00:14:41.738 --> 00:14:43.813
the camp woke up to a big commotion,

00:14:43.837 --> 00:14:46.521
because Pincho had fled.

00:14:46.545 --> 00:14:49.306
They made us dismantle the camp,
and we started marching.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.593
During the march,

00:14:52.149 --> 00:14:56.705
the head guerrillas told us
that Pincho had died,

00:14:56.729 --> 00:14:59.864
and that they had found his remains

00:14:59.888 --> 00:15:01.419
eaten by an anaconda.

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:06.073
Seventeen days passed --

00:15:06.097 --> 00:15:11.448
and believe me, I counted them,
because they were torture for me.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.980
But on the seventeenth day,

00:15:18.003 --> 00:15:19.919
the news exploded from the radio:

00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:23.157
Pincho was free and obviously alive.

00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:27.528
And this was the first thing he said:

00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:30.872
"I know my fellow hostages are listening.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:33.127
Ingrid,

00:15:33.151 --> 00:15:34.873
I did what you told me.

00:15:34.897 --> 00:15:36.568
I called the man upstairs,

00:15:36.592 --> 00:15:40.133
and he sent me the patrol
that rescued me from the jungle."

00:15:43.284 --> 00:15:46.297
That was an extraordinary moment,

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:47.487
because ...

00:15:48.098 --> 00:15:50.098
obviously fear is contagious.

00:15:50.729 --> 00:15:52.159
But faith is, too.

00:15:52.183 --> 00:15:54.822
Faith isn't rational or emotional.

00:15:55.631 --> 00:15:56.813
Faith

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.476
is an exercise of the will.

00:16:01.087 --> 00:16:03.721
It's the discipline of the will.

00:16:04.173 --> 00:16:07.644
It's what allows us to transform
everything that we are --

00:16:07.668 --> 00:16:09.966
our weaknesses, our frailties,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.580
into strength, into power.

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:13.604
It's truly a transformation.

00:16:14.641 --> 00:16:17.502
It's what gives us the strength

00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:18.907
to stand up

00:16:20.264 --> 00:16:21.469
in the face of fear

00:16:22.484 --> 00:16:24.208
look above it,

00:16:24.232 --> 00:16:25.630
and see beyond it.

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:30.042
I hope you remember that,

00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:33.440
because I know we all need

00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:37.457
to connect with that strength
we have inside of us

00:16:38.057 --> 00:16:42.499
for the times when there's a storm
raging around our boat.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.669
Many, many, many, many years passed

00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:54.008
before I could return to my house.

00:16:55.936 --> 00:17:00.965
But when they took us, handcuffed,
into the helicopter

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:03.044
that finally took us out of the jungle,

00:17:03.068 --> 00:17:06.313
everything happened as quickly
as when they kidnapped me.

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:09.429
In an instant,

00:17:09.453 --> 00:17:13.476
I saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.725
gagged,

00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:17.832
and the rescue leader,

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:20.174
yelling:

00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:24.342
"We're the Colombian army!

00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:26.746
You are free!"

00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:29.841
The shriek

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.692
that came out of all of us

00:17:32.716 --> 00:17:34.707
when we regained our freedom,

00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:39.772
continues to vibrate in me to this day.

00:17:42.089 --> 00:17:43.260
Now,

00:17:44.363 --> 00:17:47.570
I know they can divide all of us,

00:17:47.594 --> 00:17:50.011
they can manipulate us all with fear.

00:17:52.646 --> 00:17:56.914
The "No" vote on the peace
referendum in Colombia;

00:17:56.938 --> 00:17:58.707
Brexit;

00:17:58.731 --> 00:18:02.478
the idea of a wall
between Mexico and the United States;

00:18:03.143 --> 00:18:04.825
Islamic terrorism --

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:09.146
they're all examples
of using fear politically

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:12.437
to divide and recruit us.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.190
We all feel fear.

00:18:16.912 --> 00:18:20.279
But we can all avoid being recruited

00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:26.366
using the resources we have --
our principles, unity, faith.

00:18:27.659 --> 00:18:31.267
Yes, fear is part of the human condition,

00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:34.570
as well as being necessary for survival.

00:18:35.205 --> 00:18:36.944
But above all,

00:18:36.968 --> 00:18:41.724
it's the guide by which each of us builds

00:18:42.574 --> 00:18:45.742
our identity, our personality.

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:55.629
It's true, I was 41 years old
the first time I felt fear,

00:18:55.653 --> 00:18:59.233
and feeling fear was not my decision.

00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:04.753
But it was my decision
what to do with that fear.

00:19:07.054 --> 00:19:10.466
You can survive

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.281
crawling along, fearful.

00:19:14.898 --> 00:19:16.378
But you can also

00:19:17.847 --> 00:19:20.382
rise above the fear,

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:23.218
rise up, spread your wings,

00:19:23.242 --> 00:19:27.919
and soar, fly high, high, high, high,
until you reach the stars,

00:19:27.943 --> 00:19:30.969
where all of us want to go.

00:19:33.367 --> 00:19:34.519
Thank you.

00:19:34.543 --> 00:19:38.351
(Applause)
