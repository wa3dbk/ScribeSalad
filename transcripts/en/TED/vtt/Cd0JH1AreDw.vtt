00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.014
I'm a teacher and a practitioner

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.499
of civics in America.

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.571
Now, I will kindly ask those of
you who have just fallen asleep

00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.683
to please wake up. (Laughter)

00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.974
Why is it that the very word "civics"

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.865
has such a soporific, 
even a narcoleptic effect

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.171
on us?

00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.312
I think it's because the very 
word signifies something

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:35.420
exceedingly virtuous, 
exceedingly important,

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.830
and exceedingly boring.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.883
Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,

00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:42.637
people who show up for gatherings like this

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.384
in person or online, in any way we can,

00:00:45.384 --> 00:00:48.285
to make civics sexy again,

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:51.111
as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.554
as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.760
And I believe the way we make civics sexy again

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.110
is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.603
The way we do that, I believe,

00:01:04.603 --> 00:01:06.997
is at the level of the city.

00:01:06.997 --> 00:01:08.796
This is what I want to talk about today,

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.108
and I want to start by defining some terms

00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:13.183
and then I want to describe the scale

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:15.046
of the problem I think we face

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:17.472
and then suggest the ways that I believe cities

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:19.992
can be the seat of the solution.

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:23.780
So let me start with some definitions.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.557
By civics, I simply mean the art

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:28.808
of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor

00:01:28.808 --> 00:01:30.935
in a self-governing community.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:33.364
Civics is the art of citizenship,

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.479
what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.571
showing up for life,

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:39.956
and it encompasses three things:

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:43.500
a foundation of values,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.266
an understanding of the systems
that make the world go round,

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.620
and a set of skills

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.104
that allow you to pursue goals

00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:54.777
and to have others join in that pursuit.

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:57.036
And that brings me to my definition of power,

00:01:57.036 --> 00:01:59.204
which is simply this:

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:01.870
the capacity to make others do

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.631
what you would have them do.

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.312
It sounds menacing, doesn't it?

00:02:07.312 --> 00:02:09.653
We don't like to talk about power.

00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:15.347
We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.

00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:17.129
We feel uncomfortable naming it.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.542
In the culture and mythology of democracy,

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:21.285
power resides with the people.

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:23.078
Period. End of story.

00:02:23.078 --> 00:02:24.653
Any further inquiry not necessary

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:26.633
and not really that welcome.

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:30.691
Power has a negative moral valence.

00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:33.473
It sounds Machiavellian inherently.

00:02:33.473 --> 00:02:36.107
It seems inherently evil.

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:39.912
But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil

00:02:39.912 --> 00:02:43.030
than fire or physics.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.140
It just is.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.346
And power governs

00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:47.947
how any form of government operates,

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:51.427
whether a democracy or a dictatorship.

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:54.668
And the problem we face today,
here in America in particular,

00:02:54.668 --> 00:02:56.198
but all around the world,

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:59.483
is that far too many people 
are profoundly illiterate

00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:01.463
in power —

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:03.533
what it is, who has it,

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.996
how it operates, how it flows,

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:08.516
what part of it is visible, 
what part of it is not,

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:12.128
why some people have it, 
why that's compounded.

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:15.617
And as a result of this illiteracy,

00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:18.483
those few who do understand

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:20.973
how power operates in civic life,

00:03:20.973 --> 00:03:22.311
those who understand

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:24.134
how a bill becomes a law, yes,

00:03:24.134 --> 00:03:28.289
but also how a friendship 
becomes a subsidy,

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.694
or how a bias becomes a policy,

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:34.629
or how a slogan becomes a movement,

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.609
the people who understand those things

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.180
wield disproportionate influence,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.660
and they're perfectly happy

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.740
to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.287
of the great majority.

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:50.543
This is why it is so fundamental for us right now

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:54.999
to grab hold of this idea of power

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.755
and to democratize it.

00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:01.299
One of the things that is so profoundly exciting

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.282
and challenging about this moment

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:06.484
is that as a result of this power illiteracy

00:04:06.484 --> 00:04:09.151
that is so pervasive,

00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:12.240
there is a concentration

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.491
of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.

00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:18.578
I mean, think about it:

00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:21.993
How does a friendship become a subsidy?

00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:23.270
Seamlessly,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.905
when a senior government official decides

00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:28.402
to leave government and become a lobbyist

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:30.316
for a private interest

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:33.018
and convert his or her relationships into capital

00:04:33.018 --> 00:04:35.325
for their new masters.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.750
How does a bias become a policy?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.350
Insidiously, just the way that

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.510
stop-and-frisk, for instance,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.166
became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:50.271
How does a slogan become a movement?

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:53.252
Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,

00:04:53.252 --> 00:04:56.718
was able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag

00:04:56.718 --> 00:04:58.465
from the American Revolution,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:00.315
or how, on the other side,

00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:03.279
a band of activists could take a magazine headline,

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.216
"Occupy Wall Street,"

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:08.132
and turn that into a global meme and movement.

00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:10.638
The thing is, though, most people

00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:13.890
aren't looking for and don't
want to see these realities.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.325
So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,

00:05:17.325 --> 00:05:19.122
is willful.

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:20.970
There are some millennials, for instance,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.636
who think the whole business is just sordid.

00:05:23.636 --> 00:05:25.312
They don't want to have anything to do with politics.

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:26.391
They'd rather just opt out

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:29.179
and engage in volunteerism.

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:31.372
There are some techies out there

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:32.668
who believe that the cure-all

00:05:32.668 --> 00:05:35.216
for any power imbalance or power abuse

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:37.610
is simply more data,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.093
more transparency.

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:42.308
There are some on the left who think power resides

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:44.167
only with corporations,

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.090
and some on the right who think power

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.603
resides only with government,

00:05:47.603 --> 00:05:51.964
each side blinded by their selective outrage.

00:05:51.964 --> 00:05:54.008
There are the naive who believe that

00:05:54.008 --> 00:05:55.315
good things just happen

00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:58.665
and the cynical who believe
that bad things just happen,

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:01.017
the fortunate and unfortunate alike

00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:04.540
who think that their lot is simply what they deserve

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.501
rather than the eminently alterable result

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.783
of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,

00:06:11.783 --> 00:06:15.446
of power.

00:06:15.446 --> 00:06:19.122
As a result of all of this
creeping fatalism in public life,

00:06:19.122 --> 00:06:21.259
we here, particularly in America today,

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.141
have depressingly low levels

00:06:23.141 --> 00:06:26.199
of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.380
awareness.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.258
The whole business of politics has been

00:06:31.258 --> 00:06:34.950
effectively subcontracted out
to a band of professionals,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.761
money people, outreach people,

00:06:36.761 --> 00:06:38.851
message people, research people.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:41.922
The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs

00:06:41.922 --> 00:06:44.088
in the sense of suckers.

00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:46.614
We become demotivated to learn more

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:47.996
about how things work.

00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:50.251
We begin to opt out.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.221
Well, this problem, this challenge,

00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:59.910
is a thing that we must now confront,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.901
and I believe that when you have

00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:03.880
this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.359
it becomes both a cause and a consequence

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.235
of this concentration of opportunity

00:07:10.235 --> 00:07:12.596
of wealth and clout that I was
describing a moment ago,

00:07:12.596 --> 00:07:16.334
this profound civic inequality.

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.475
This is why it is so important in our time right now

00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:22.922
to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.

00:07:22.922 --> 00:07:25.566
Perhaps it's never been more important

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:30.955
at any time in our lifetimes.

00:07:30.955 --> 00:07:32.890
If people don't learn power,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.458
people don't wake up,

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.213
and if they don't wake up,

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:38.980
they get left out.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.452
Now, part of the art of practicing power

00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:45.512
means being awake and having a voice,

00:07:45.512 --> 00:07:47.897
but it also is about having an arena

00:07:47.897 --> 00:07:51.959
where you can plausibly practice deciding.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:54.141
All of civics boils down to the simple question

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:55.899
of who decides,

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.661
and you have to play that out

00:07:57.661 --> 00:07:59.694
in a place, in an arena.

00:07:59.694 --> 00:08:02.622
And this brings me to the third
point that I want to make today,

00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:06.233
which is simply that there is no better arena

00:08:06.233 --> 00:08:09.282
in our time for the practicing of power

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:12.174
than the city.

00:08:12.174 --> 00:08:14.028
Think about the city where you live,

00:08:14.028 --> 00:08:15.885
where you're from.

00:08:15.885 --> 00:08:19.136
Think about a problem in
the common life of your city.

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:20.169
It can be something small,

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:22.676
like where a street lamp should go,

00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:24.297
or something medium like

00:08:24.297 --> 00:08:28.234
which library should have its hours extended or cut,

00:08:28.234 --> 00:08:29.804
or maybe something bigger,

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:32.502
like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:35.437
turned into a highway or a greenway,

00:08:35.437 --> 00:08:37.135
or whether all the businesses in your town

00:08:37.135 --> 00:08:41.185
should be required to pay a living wage.

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.536
Think about the change that you want in your city,

00:08:43.536 --> 00:08:47.248
and then think about how you would get it,

00:08:47.248 --> 00:08:50.880
how you would make it happen.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.210
Take an inventory of all the forms of power

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.354
that are at play in your city's situation:

00:08:56.354 --> 00:09:00.693
money, of course, people, yes,

00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:05.603
ideas, information, misinformation,

00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:09.227
the threat of force, the force of norms.

00:09:09.227 --> 00:09:11.138
All of these form of power are at play.

00:09:11.138 --> 00:09:12.680
Now think about how you would activate

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.483
or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.

00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:20.689
This is not some Game of Thrones

00:09:20.689 --> 00:09:23.025
empire-level set of questions.

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:24.918
These are questions that play out

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:27.664
in every single place on the planet.

00:09:27.664 --> 00:09:29.823
I'll just tell you quickly about two stories

00:09:29.823 --> 00:09:31.859
drawn from recent headlines.

00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:33.301
In Boulder, Colorado,

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.290
voters not too long ago approved a process

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.182
to replace the private power company,

00:09:40.182 --> 00:09:42.494
literally the power company,
the electric company Xcel,

00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:44.790
with a publicly owned utility

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.136
that would forego profits

00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:49.845
and attend far more to climate change.

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:51.970
Well, Xcel fought back,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.330
and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.226
that would undermine or undo

00:09:56.226 --> 00:09:58.022
this municipalization.

00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:00.636
And so the citizen activists in
Boulder who have been pushing this

00:10:00.636 --> 00:10:03.370
now literally have to fight the power

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.969
in order to fight for power.

00:10:05.969 --> 00:10:10.342
In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,

00:10:10.342 --> 00:10:12.278
there's an organization on campus

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:16.151
called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,

00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:19.522
and it draws from largely white sororities

00:10:19.522 --> 00:10:20.962
and fraternities on campus,

00:10:20.962 --> 00:10:23.381
and for decades, the Machine has dominated

00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:25.234
student government elections.

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.630
Well now, recently, the Machine

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.927
has started to get involved

00:10:28.927 --> 00:10:30.610
in actual city politics,

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.268
and they've engineered the election

00:10:32.268 --> 00:10:33.640
of a former Machine member,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.346
a young, pro-business recent graduate

00:10:36.346 --> 00:10:39.860
to the Tuscaloosa city school board.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.696
Now, as I say, these are just two examples

00:10:42.696 --> 00:10:45.400
drawn almost at random from the headlines.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.600
Every day, there are thousands more like them.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.364
And you may like or dislike

00:10:50.364 --> 00:10:52.269
the efforts I'm describing here

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:53.598
in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,

00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:56.240
but you cannot help but admire

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.311
the power literacy of the players involved,

00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.486
their skill.

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:03.462
You cannot help but reckon with and recognize

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:05.073
the command they have

00:11:05.073 --> 00:11:07.608
of the elemental questions

00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:09.484
of civic power —

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:13.522
what objective, what strategy, what tactics,

00:11:13.522 --> 00:11:16.500
what is the terrain, who are your enemies,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.650
who are your allies?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.395
Now I want you to return

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:23.790
to thinking about that problem or that opportunity

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.951
or that challenge in your city,

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:27.824
and the thing it was that you want to fix

00:11:27.824 --> 00:11:29.635
or create in your city,

00:11:29.635 --> 00:11:31.950
and ask yourself,

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.600
do you have command of these
elemental questions of power?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.650
Could you put into practice effectively

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.664
what it is that you know?

00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:46.061
This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.

00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.577
We live in a time right now

00:11:48.577 --> 00:11:51.564
where in spite of globalization

00:11:51.564 --> 00:11:53.724
or perhaps because of globalization,

00:11:53.724 --> 00:11:55.760
all citizenship is ever more resonantly,

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.540
powerfully local.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.248
Indeed, power in our time is flowing

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:02.610
ever faster to the city.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.258
Here in the United States, the national government

00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:07.259
has tied itself up in partisan knots.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:10.181
Civic imagination and innovation and creativity

00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.798
are emerging from local ecosystems now

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:14.688
and radiating outward,

00:12:14.688 --> 00:12:18.128
and this great innovation,

00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:21.055
this great wave

00:12:21.055 --> 00:12:24.981
of localism that's now arriving,

00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:26.646
and you see it in how people eat

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:29.294
and work and share and buy and move

00:12:29.294 --> 00:12:30.989
and live their everyday lives,

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:34.142
this isn't some precious parochialism,

00:12:34.142 --> 00:12:37.456
this isn't some retreat into insularity, no.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:39.819
This is emergent.

00:12:39.819 --> 00:12:43.610
The localism of our time is networked powerfully.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:44.873
And so, for instance,

00:12:44.873 --> 00:12:47.036
consider the ways that strategies

00:12:47.036 --> 00:12:49.470
for making cities more bike-friendly

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.016
have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen

00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:57.138
to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.

00:12:57.138 --> 00:13:00.702
Think about how experiments
in participatory budgeting,

00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:02.175
where everyday citizens get a chance

00:13:02.175 --> 00:13:04.976
to allocate and decide upon

00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:07.910
the allocation of city funds.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.490
Those experiments have
spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.840
to here in New York City, 
to the wards of Chicago.

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:17.991
Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles

00:13:17.991 --> 00:13:20.341
and many cities between

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:22.624
are now organizing to stage strikes

00:13:22.624 --> 00:13:24.694
to remind the people who live in their cities

00:13:24.694 --> 00:13:27.980
what a day without immigrants would look like.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.438
In China, all across that country,

00:13:30.438 --> 00:13:32.646
members of the New Citizens' Movement

00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.232
are beginning to activate and organize

00:13:34.232 --> 00:13:36.886
to fight official corruption and graft,

00:13:36.886 --> 00:13:38.990
and they're drawing the ire of officials there,

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.733
but they're also drawing the attention

00:13:40.733 --> 00:13:44.288
of anti-corruption activists all around the world.

00:13:44.288 --> 00:13:46.223
In Seattle, where I'm from,

00:13:46.223 --> 00:13:48.669
we've become part of a great global array of cities

00:13:48.669 --> 00:13:50.228
that are now working together

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:51.758
bypassing government altogether,

00:13:51.758 --> 00:13:54.138
national government altogether,

00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:56.487
in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals

00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:58.627
of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:13:58.627 --> 00:14:01.670
All of these citizens, united,

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.345
are forming a web,

00:14:03.345 --> 00:14:05.358
a great archipelago of power

00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:07.765
that allows us to bypass

00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:11.669
brokenness and monopolies of control.

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:14.550
And our task now is to accelerate this work.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.664
Our task now is to bring more and more people

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:18.695
into the fold of this work.

00:14:18.695 --> 00:14:21.444
That's why my organization, Citizen University,

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.448
has undertaken a project now

00:14:23.448 --> 00:14:26.293
to create an everyman's curriculum

00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:28.610
in civic power.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.815
And this curriculum starts with this triad

00:14:30.815 --> 00:14:32.830
that I described earlier of values,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.956
systems and skills.

00:14:35.956 --> 00:14:38.808
And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you

00:14:38.808 --> 00:14:41.458
to help create this curriculum

00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:43.885
with the stories and the experiences

00:14:43.885 --> 00:14:47.142
and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,

00:14:47.142 --> 00:14:50.146
to create something powerfully collective.

00:14:50.146 --> 00:14:52.557
And I want to invite you in particular to try

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:54.656
a simple exercise drawn

00:14:54.656 --> 00:14:57.199
from the early frameworks of this curriculum.

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:59.630
I want you to write a narrative,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.680
a narrative from the future of your city,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.221
and you can date it, set it out one year from now,

00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:07.965
five years from now, a decade from now,

00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:09.766
a generation from now,

00:15:09.766 --> 00:15:13.611
and write it as a case study looking back,

00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:15.256
looking back at the change

00:15:15.256 --> 00:15:17.352
that you wanted in your city,

00:15:17.352 --> 00:15:20.091
looking back at the cause
that you were championing,

00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:22.825
and describing the ways that that change

00:15:22.825 --> 00:15:27.036
and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.

00:15:27.036 --> 00:15:28.948
Describe the values

00:15:28.948 --> 00:15:31.333
of your fellow citizens that you activated,

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.940
and the sense of moral purpose
that you were able to stir.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.602
Recount all the different ways

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.230
that you engaged the systems of government,

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.741
of the marketplace,

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.946
of social institutions, of faith organizations,

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:46.148
of the media.

00:15:46.148 --> 00:15:50.113
Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,

00:15:50.113 --> 00:15:52.527
how to negotiate, how to advocate,

00:15:52.527 --> 00:15:53.922
how to frame issues,

00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:56.463
how to navigate diversity in conflict,

00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:58.282
all those skills that enabled you

00:15:58.282 --> 00:16:00.353
to bring folks on board

00:16:00.353 --> 00:16:03.050
and to overcome resistance.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.422
What you'll be doing when you write that narrative

00:16:06.422 --> 00:16:10.501
is you'll be discovering how to read power,

00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:15.698
and in the process, how to write power.

00:16:15.698 --> 00:16:17.903
So share what you write,

00:16:17.903 --> 00:16:19.241
do you what you write,

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:23.058
and then share what you do.

00:16:23.058 --> 00:16:25.052
I invite you to literally share

00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:26.946
the narratives that you create

00:16:26.946 --> 00:16:29.890
on our Facebook page for Citizen University.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.572
But even beyond that, it's in the conversations

00:16:32.572 --> 00:16:34.128
that we have today

00:16:34.128 --> 00:16:36.389
all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:39.239
that are happening on this topic at this moment,

00:16:39.239 --> 00:16:40.990
and to think about how we can become

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.590
one another's teachers and students in power.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.863
If we do that, then together

00:16:46.863 --> 00:16:49.276
we can make civics sexy again.

00:16:49.276 --> 00:16:51.678
Together, we can democratize democracy

00:16:51.678 --> 00:16:54.888
and make it safe again for amateurs.

00:16:54.888 --> 00:16:59.237
Together, we can create a great network of city

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:01.769
that will be the most powerful collective laboratory

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:05.235
for self-government this planet has ever seen.

00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:08.221
We have the power to do that.

00:17:08.221 --> 00:17:10.690
Thank you very much.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:13.933
(Applause)
