00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.841
I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on

00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.404
involving a man named Steve Titus.

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:23.433
Titus was a restaurant manager.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.523
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:29.418
he was engaged to Gretchen,

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:32.366
about to be married, she was the love of his life.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.650
And one night, the couple went out

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.655
for a romantic restaurant meal.

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:39.303
They were on their way home,

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.253
and they were pulled over by a police officer.

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:45.570
You see, Titus' car sort of resembled

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.457
a car that was driven earlier in the evening

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:52.863
by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,

00:00:52.863 --> 00:00:56.457
and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:59.035
So the police took a picture of Titus,

00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:01.802
they put it in a photo lineup,

00:01:01.802 --> 00:01:03.962
they later showed it to the victim,

00:01:03.962 --> 00:01:06.122
and she pointed to Titus' photo.

00:01:06.122 --> 00:01:09.743
She said, "That one's the closest."

00:01:09.743 --> 00:01:13.631
The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:16.972
and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:19.068
the rape victim got on the stand

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:23.410
and said, "I'm absolutely positive that's the man."

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.336
And Titus was convicted.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.310
He proclaimed his innocence,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.892
his family screamed at the jury,

00:01:30.892 --> 00:01:33.763
his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,

00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:37.158
and Titus is taken away to jail.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:40.616
So what would you do at this point?

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:42.252
What would you do?

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:46.020
Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.052
and yet he got an idea.

00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:50.483
He called up the local newspaper,

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:53.870
he got the interest of an investigative journalist,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.606
and that journalist actually found the real rapist,

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:01.959
a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.251
a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes

00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.583
in that area,

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:09.757
and when this information was given to the judge,

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:12.693
the judge set Titus free.

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:16.724
And really, that's where this case should have ended.

00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:17.847
It should have been over.

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:20.367
Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:24.203
a year of accusation and trial, but over.

00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:26.250
It didn't end that way.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.928
Titus was so bitter.

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.508
He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.

00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:33.351
He lost his fiancée.

00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.257
She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:38.403
He lost his entire savings,

00:02:38.403 --> 00:02:41.261
and so he decided to file a lawsuit

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.542
against the police and others whom he felt

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:45.861
were responsible for his suffering.

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.574
And that's when I really started working on this case,

00:02:50.574 --> 00:02:52.535
trying to figure out

00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:54.609
how did that victim go from

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.137
"That one's the closest"

00:02:56.137 --> 00:03:00.887
to "I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."

00:03:00.887 --> 00:03:04.166
Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:07.200
He spent every waking moment thinking about it,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.351
and just days before he was to have his day in court,

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.570
he woke up in the morning,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.378
doubled over in pain,

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.072
and died of a stress-related heart attack.

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:21.259
He was 35 years old.

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:26.069
So I was asked to work on Titus' case

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.584
because I'm a psychological scientist.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:32.411
I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.800
And if I meet somebody on an airplane --

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.896
this happened on the way over to Scotland --

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:39.726
if I meet somebody on an airplane,

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:42.771
and we ask each other, "What do you do? What do you do?"

00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:44.222
and I say "I study memory,"

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:47.602
they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.401
or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's

00:03:50.416 --> 00:03:52.481
or some kind of memory problem,

00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.697
but I have to tell them

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:58.202
I don't study when people forget.

00:03:58.202 --> 00:04:01.204
I study the opposite: when they remember,

00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:03.957
when they remember things that didn't happen

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.922
or remember things that were different

00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:07.947
from the way they really were.

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:12.683
I study false memories.

00:04:12.683 --> 00:04:16.990
Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.295
to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:24.603
In one project in the United States,

00:04:24.603 --> 00:04:26.855
information has been gathered

00:04:26.855 --> 00:04:30.789
on 300 innocent people,

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.684
300 defendants who were convicted of crimes they didn't do.

00:04:34.684 --> 00:04:39.984
They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.411
and now DNA testing has proven

00:04:42.411 --> 00:04:45.327
that they are actually innocent.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.848
And when those cases have been analyzed,

00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:49.989
three quarters of them

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:55.600
are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.863
Well, why?

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:00.314
Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people

00:05:00.314 --> 00:05:02.598
and the jurors who convicted Titus,

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.839
many people believe that memory

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:06.486
works like a recording device.

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:08.743
You just record the information,

00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:11.390
then you call it up and play it back

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.817
when you want to answer questions or identify images.

00:05:14.817 --> 00:05:16.980
But decades of work in psychology

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.133
has shown that this just isn't true.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.563
Our memories are constructive.

00:05:22.563 --> 00:05:24.132
They're reconstructive.

00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:27.613
Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:

00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:32.726
You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:37.975
I first started studying this constructive memory process

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:40.390
in the 1970s.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.813
I did my experiments that involved showing people

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:47.318
simulated crimes and accidents

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:50.836
and asking them questions about what they remember.

00:05:50.836 --> 00:05:54.775
In one study, we showed people a simulated accident

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:56.053
and we asked people,

00:05:56.053 --> 00:05:58.917
how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.551
And we asked other people,

00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:04.240
how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.242
And if we asked the leading "smashed" question,

00:06:07.242 --> 00:06:10.527
the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:14.524
and moreover, that leading "smashed" question

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:17.384
caused people to be more likely to tell us

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:20.451
that they saw broken glass in the accident scene

00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:24.230
when there wasn't any broken glass at all.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.119
In another study, we showed a simulated accident

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:30.779
where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.711
and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,

00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:39.560
many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.017
at the intersection, not a stop sign.

00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:45.206
And you might be thinking, well, you know,

00:06:45.206 --> 00:06:46.529
these are filmed events,

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:48.457
they are not particularly stressful.

00:06:48.457 --> 00:06:51.191
Would the same kind of mistakes be made

00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:54.142
with a really stressful event?

00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:57.233
In a study we published just a few months ago,

00:06:57.233 --> 00:06:59.537
we have an answer to this question,

00:06:59.537 --> 00:07:02.301
because what was unusual about this study

00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:07.933
is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:10.162
The subjects in this study

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.672
were members of the U.S. military

00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:17.097
who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise

00:07:17.097 --> 00:07:19.879
to teach them what it's going to be like for them

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.797
if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:26.227
And as part of this training exercise,

00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:29.756
these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,

00:07:29.756 --> 00:07:34.842
hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes

00:07:34.842 --> 00:07:37.659
and later on they have to try to identify

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.682
the person who conducted that interrogation.

00:07:40.682 --> 00:07:44.505
And when we feed them suggestive information

00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:47.283
that insinuates it's a different person,

00:07:47.283 --> 00:07:51.320
many of them misidentify their interrogator,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:55.155
often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely

00:07:55.155 --> 00:07:58.259
resemble the real interrogator.

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:00.560
And so what these studies are showing

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.420
is that when you feed people misinformation

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.800
about some experience that they may have had,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.455
you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.

00:08:13.455 --> 00:08:15.655
Well out there in the real world,

00:08:15.655 --> 00:08:18.546
misinformation is everywhere.

00:08:18.546 --> 00:08:19.906
We get misinformation

00:08:19.906 --> 00:08:22.822
not only if we're questioned in a leading way,

00:08:22.822 --> 00:08:25.269
but if we talk to other witnesses

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:28.302
who might consciously or inadvertently feed us

00:08:28.302 --> 00:08:30.439
some erroneous information,

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:35.169
or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.962
all of these provide the opportunity

00:08:37.962 --> 00:08:42.312
for this kind of contamination of our memory.

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:46.100
In the 1990s, we began to see

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.783
an even more extreme kind of memory problem.

00:08:50.783 --> 00:08:53.879
Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:56.793
maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --

00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:59.546
and they were coming out of therapy

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:02.207
with a different problem.

00:09:02.207 --> 00:09:05.908
Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,

00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:07.891
sometimes in satanic rituals,

00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.588
sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.

00:09:12.588 --> 00:09:15.142
One woman came out of psychotherapy

00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:17.570
believing that she'd endured years

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.472
of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy

00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:24.038
and that the baby was cut from her belly.

00:09:24.038 --> 00:09:26.397
But there were no physical scars

00:09:26.397 --> 00:09:28.423
or any kind of physical evidence

00:09:28.423 --> 00:09:31.304
that could have supported her story.

00:09:31.304 --> 00:09:34.312
And when I began looking into these cases,

00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:35.762
I was wondering,

00:09:35.762 --> 00:09:38.090
where do these bizarre memories come from?

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.477
And what I found is that most of these situations

00:09:42.477 --> 00:09:47.968
involved some particular form of psychotherapy.

00:09:47.968 --> 00:09:49.567
And so I asked,

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:52.955
were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --

00:09:52.955 --> 00:09:55.839
like the imagination exercises

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.896
or dream interpretation,

00:09:57.896 --> 00:10:00.028
or in some cases hypnosis,

00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:03.846
or in some cases exposure to false information --

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:06.633
were these leading these patients

00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:09.310
to develop these very bizarre,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.241
unlikely memories?

00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:14.400
And I designed some experiments

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.425
to try to study the processes that were being used

00:10:19.425 --> 00:10:22.498
in this psychotherapy so I could study

00:10:22.498 --> 00:10:26.049
the development of these very rich false memories.

00:10:26.049 --> 00:10:28.457
In one of the first studies we did,

00:10:28.457 --> 00:10:30.810
we used suggestion,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.873
a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,

00:10:34.873 --> 00:10:36.983
we used this kind of suggestion

00:10:36.983 --> 00:10:38.835
and planted a false memory

00:10:38.835 --> 00:10:41.912
that when you were a kid, five or six years old,

00:10:41.912 --> 00:10:44.163
you were lost in a shopping mall.

00:10:44.163 --> 00:10:46.663
You were frightened. You were crying.

00:10:46.663 --> 00:10:49.177
You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person

00:10:49.177 --> 00:10:51.029
and reunited with the family.

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:53.637
And we succeeded in planting this memory

00:10:53.637 --> 00:10:57.743
in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.

00:10:57.743 --> 00:10:59.748
And you might be thinking, well,

00:10:59.748 --> 00:11:02.094
that's not particularly stressful.

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:05.463
But we and other investigators have planted

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.221
rich false memories of things that were

00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.136
much more unusual and much more stressful.

00:11:11.136 --> 00:11:13.675
So in a study done in Tennessee,

00:11:13.675 --> 00:11:16.091
researchers planted the false memory

00:11:16.091 --> 00:11:18.665
that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned

00:11:18.665 --> 00:11:21.172
and had to be rescued by a life guard.

00:11:21.172 --> 00:11:23.475
And in a study done in Canada,

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:25.999
researchers planted the false memory

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:27.227
that when you were a kid,

00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:30.957
something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal

00:11:30.957 --> 00:11:32.339
happened to you,

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:35.761
succeeding with about half of their subjects.

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:38.113
And in a study done in Italy,

00:11:38.113 --> 00:11:40.771
researchers planted the false memory,

00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:45.983
when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.

00:11:45.983 --> 00:11:48.190
I do want to add that it might seem

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:51.929
like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects

00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:53.529
in the name of science,

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:58.167
but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.142
by research ethics boards

00:12:00.142 --> 00:12:02.484
that have made the decision

00:12:02.484 --> 00:12:05.557
that the temporary discomfort that some

00:12:05.557 --> 00:12:08.641
of these subjects might experience in these studies

00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:12.541
is outweighed by the importance of this problem

00:12:12.541 --> 00:12:15.648
for understanding memory processes

00:12:15.648 --> 00:12:18.994
and the abuse of memory that is going on

00:12:18.994 --> 00:12:22.287
in some places in the world.

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:25.325
Well, to my surprise,

00:12:25.325 --> 00:12:28.754
when I published this work and began to speak out

00:12:28.754 --> 00:12:32.649
against this particular brand of psychotherapy,

00:12:32.649 --> 00:12:36.629
it created some pretty bad problems for me:

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:41.530
hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.206
who felt under attack,

00:12:43.206 --> 00:12:46.734
and by the patients whom they had influenced.

00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:49.671
I had sometimes armed guards at speeches

00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:51.576
that I was invited to give,

00:12:51.576 --> 00:12:55.793
people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.

00:12:55.793 --> 00:12:57.774
But probably the worst

00:12:57.774 --> 00:13:00.541
was I suspected that a woman

00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:02.965
was innocent of abuse

00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:05.801
that was being claimed by her grown daughter.

00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:09.218
She accused her mother of sexual abuse

00:13:09.218 --> 00:13:11.077
based on a repressed memory.

00:13:11.077 --> 00:13:13.960
And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.394
to be filmed and presented in public places.

00:13:17.394 --> 00:13:19.903
I was suspicious of this story,

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:22.203
and so I started to investigate,

00:13:22.203 --> 00:13:26.686
and eventually found information that convinced me

00:13:26.686 --> 00:13:28.975
that this mother was innocent.

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.936
I published an exposé on the case,

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:35.380
and a little while later, the accusing daughter

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.901
filed a lawsuit.

00:13:36.901 --> 00:13:39.256
Even though I'd never mentioned her name,

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:43.618
she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.

00:13:43.618 --> 00:13:46.341
And I went through nearly five years

00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:52.893
of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,

00:13:52.893 --> 00:13:56.567
but finally, finally, it was over and I could really

00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:58.991
get back to my work.

00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:01.476
In the process, however, I became part

00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:04.130
of a disturbing trend in America

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.237
where scientists are being sued

00:14:06.237 --> 00:14:10.836
for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.

00:14:10.836 --> 00:14:14.194
When I got back to my work, I asked this question:

00:14:14.194 --> 00:14:16.592
if I plant a false memory in your mind,

00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:18.436
does it have repercussions?

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.395
Does it affect your later thoughts,

00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:22.496
your later behaviors?

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:24.523
Our first study planted a false memory

00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:27.849
that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:

00:14:27.849 --> 00:14:30.848
hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:34.038
And we found that once we planted this false memory,

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:36.489
people didn't want to eat the foods as much

00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:38.749
at an outdoor picnic.

00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:42.622
The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.

00:14:42.622 --> 00:14:44.980
If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.001
involving a healthy food like asparagus,

00:14:48.001 --> 00:14:51.476
we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.

00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:53.850
And so what these studies are showing

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.965
is that you can plant false memories

00:14:55.965 --> 00:14:57.378
and they have repercussions

00:14:57.378 --> 00:15:02.463
that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.

00:15:02.463 --> 00:15:04.887
Well, along with this ability

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:07.810
to plant memories and control behavior

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.991
obviously come some important ethical issues,

00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:15.050
like, when should we use this mind technology?

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.730
And should we ever ban its use?

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.513
Therapists can't ethically plant false memories

00:15:21.513 --> 00:15:23.100
in the mind of their patients

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.664
even if it would help the patient,

00:15:25.664 --> 00:15:27.286
but there's nothing to stop a parent

00:15:27.286 --> 00:15:31.735
from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.

00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:34.340
And when I suggested this publicly,

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.686
it created an outcry again.

00:15:37.686 --> 00:15:41.719
"There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."

00:15:41.719 --> 00:15:43.964
Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)

00:15:43.964 --> 00:15:53.461
I mean, another way to think about this is,

00:15:53.461 --> 00:15:55.494
which would you rather have,

00:15:55.494 --> 00:15:58.523
a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,

00:15:58.523 --> 00:16:00.055
all the things that go with it,

00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:03.071
or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?

00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:06.462
I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.

00:16:06.462 --> 00:16:10.439
But maybe my work has made me different from most people.

00:16:10.439 --> 00:16:12.518
Most people cherish their memories,

00:16:12.518 --> 00:16:14.672
know that they represent their identity,

00:16:14.672 --> 00:16:16.697
who they are, where they came from.

00:16:16.697 --> 00:16:19.555
And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.

00:16:19.555 --> 00:16:21.760
But I know from my work

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.241
how much fiction is already in there.

00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:28.973
If I've learned anything from these decades

00:16:28.973 --> 00:16:31.383
of working on these problems, it's this:

00:16:31.383 --> 00:16:33.594
just because somebody tells you something

00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:35.169
and they say it with confidence,

00:16:35.169 --> 00:16:37.849
just because they say it with lots of detail,

00:16:37.849 --> 00:16:40.608
just because they express emotion when they say it,

00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:43.810
it doesn't mean that it really happened.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.675
We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:51.223
We need independent corroboration.

00:16:51.223 --> 00:16:54.313
Such a discovery has made me more tolerant

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.452
of the everyday memory mistakes

00:16:56.452 --> 00:16:59.366
that my friends and family members make.

00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:03.900
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.476
the man whose whole future was snatched away

00:17:07.476 --> 00:17:09.714
by a false memory.

00:17:09.714 --> 00:17:12.530
But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.166
we'd do well to,

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:18.037
that memory, like liberty,

00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:21.731
is a fragile thing.

00:17:21.731 --> 00:17:24.669
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.397
Thank you. (Applause)

00:17:27.397 --> 00:17:31.116
Thanks very much. (Applause)
