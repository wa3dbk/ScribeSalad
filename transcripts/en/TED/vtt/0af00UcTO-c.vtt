00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.260
Just a few minutes ago, I took this picture

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
about 10 blocks from here.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.260
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
I took this picture because this turns out to be

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.260
the first coffeehouse to open

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
in England in 1650.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.260
That's its great claim to fame,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
and I wanted to show it to you,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.260
not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.260
of historic England,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260
but rather because

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.260
the English coffeehouse was crucial

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
to the development and spread

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
what we now call the Enlightenment.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.260
And the coffeehouse played such a big role

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.260
in the birth of the Enlightenment,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.260
in part, because of what people were drinking there.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Because, before the spread

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
of coffee and tea through British culture,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
day-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.260
was alcohol.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.260
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.260
a little gin -- particularly around 1650 --

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.260
and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.260
That was the healthy choice -- right --

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
because the water wasn't safe to drink.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.260
And so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260
you had an entire population

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.260
that was effectively drunk all day.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.260
And you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life --

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and I know this is true of some of you --

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.260
if you were drinking all day,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260
and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.260
you would have better ideas.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.260
You would be sharper and more alert.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
as England switched to tea and coffee.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
is the architecture of the space.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260
It was a space where people would get together

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.260
from different backgrounds,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.260
different fields of expertise, and share.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.260
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense --

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
ideas would get together there.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.260
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.260
have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.260
I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
for the last five years,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
because I've been kind of on this quest

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.260
to investigate this question

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260
of where good ideas come from.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.260
What are the environments

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
that lead to unusual levels of innovation,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
unusual levels of creativity?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
What's the kind of environmental --

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
what is the space of creativity?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
And what I've done is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.260
I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.260
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
I've gone back to the history of the first cities;

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.260
I've even gone to biological environments,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260
like coral reefs and rainforests,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.260
that involve unusual levels of biological innovation;

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.260
and what I've been looking for is shared patterns,

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.260
kind of signature behavior that shows up

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
again and again in all of these environments.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.260
that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.260
or our own organizations,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.260
or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
And I think I've found a few.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.260
But what you have to do to make sense of this

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.260
and to really understand these principles

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
is you have to do away

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.260
with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.260
steers us towards

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.260
certain concepts of idea-creation.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.260
We have this very rich vocabulary

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.260
to describe moments of inspiration.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260
We have the kind of the flash of insight,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.260
the stroke of insight,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
we have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.260
we have the lightbulb moments, right?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.260
All of these concepts,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
as kind of rhetorically florid as they are,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
share this basic assumption,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.260
which is that an idea is a single thing,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.260
it's something that happens often

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.260
in a wonderful illuminating moment.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.260
But in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.260
is this idea that an idea is a network

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.260
on the most elemental level.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.260
I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
An idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.260
firing in sync with each other inside your brain.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260
It's a new configuration that has never formed before.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
And the question is: how do you get your brain into environments

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.260
And it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.260
mimic a lot of the network patterns

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.260
of the internal world of the human brain.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
So the metaphor I'd like the use

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
I can take

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
from a story of a great idea that's quite recent --

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.260
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.260
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.260
who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
of, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.260
in the developing world.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.260
by getting modern neonatal incubators

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.260
into any context,

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.260
if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple --

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.260
we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
So, the technology is there.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
and you send it off

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
to a mid-sized village in Africa,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
it will work great for a year or two years,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.260
and then something will go wrong and it will break,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
and it will remain broken forever,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
because you don't have a whole system of spare parts,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.260
and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.260
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260
And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.260
getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.260
and then it ends up being useless.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So what Prestero and his team decided to do

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.260
is to look around and see: what are the abundant resources

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.260
in these developing world contexts?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs,

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
they don't have a lot of microwaves,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.260
but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
There's a Toyota 4Runner

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.260
on the street in all these places.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
So they started to think,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.260
that's built entirely out of automobile parts?"

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260
And this is what they ended up coming with.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.260
It's called a "neonurture device."

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.260
From the outside, it looks like a normal little thing

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
you'd find in a modern, Western hospital.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260
In the inside, it's all car parts.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.260
It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
it's got door chimes for alarm --

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.260
it runs off a car battery.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.260
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
and the ability to fix a headlight,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.260
and you can repair this thing.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.260
Now, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.260
this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.260
We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.260
are like that $40,000, brand new incubator,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.260
state-of-the-art technology,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.260
but more often than not, they're cobbled together

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.260
from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.260
We take ideas from other people,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.260
from people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.260
and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.260
That's really where innovation happens.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
And that means that we have to change some of our models

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.260
I mean, this is one vision of it.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
This is a statue from Oxford.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.260
You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.260
and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260
In fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.260
tend to look like this, right.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.260
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.260
but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.260
This is the kind of chaotic environment

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
where ideas were likely to come together,

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
where people were likely to have

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
new, interesting, unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.260
So, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.260
we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.260
This is what your office should look like,

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.260
is part of my message here.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.260
And one of the problems with this is that

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.260
people are actually -- when you research this field --

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.260
people are notoriously unreliable,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.260
when they actually kind of self-report

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260
on where they have their own good ideas,

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.260
or their history of their best ideas.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.260
And a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.260
decided to go around

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:07.260
and basically do the Big Brother approach

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.260
to figuring out where good ideas come from.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.260
He went to a bunch of science labs around the world

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
and videotaped everyone

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
as they were doing every little bit of their job.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
So when they were sitting in front of the microscope,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
And he recorded all of these conversations

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
and tried to figure out where the most important ideas,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
where they happened.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.260
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.260
we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.260
and they see something in the tissue sample.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.260
And "oh, eureka," they've got the idea.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.260
is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.260
did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.260
They happened at the conference table

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.260
at the weekly lab meeting,

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.260
when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.260
oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.260
the error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
And something about that environment --

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.260
and I've started calling it the "liquid network,"

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.260
where you have lots of different ideas that are together,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
different backgrounds, different interests,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
jostling with each other, bouncing off each other --

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
that environment is, in fact,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
the environment that leads to innovation.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.260
The other problem that people have

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.260
is they like to condense their stories of innovation down

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.260
to kind of shorter time frames.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.260
So they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.260
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.260
and I had it all suddenly clear in my head."

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.260
But in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260
it turns out that a lot of important ideas

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.260
have very long incubation periods --

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.260
I call this the "slow hunch."

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.260
We've heard a lot recently

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
about hunch and instinct

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.260
but in fact, a lot of great ideas

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.260
linger on, sometimes for decades,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.260
in the back of people's minds.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.260
but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.260
They spend all this time working on certain problems,

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.260
but there's another thing lingering there

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.260
that they're interested in, but they can't quite solve.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.260
Darwin is a great example of this.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.260
tells the story of coming up with the idea

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.260
for natural selection

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.260
as a classic "eureka!" moment.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.260
He's in his study,

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260
it's October of 1838,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
And all of a sudden,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.260
the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.260
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.260
That's in his autobiography.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.260
About a decade or two ago,

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260
a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.260
And Darwin kept these copious notebooks

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.260
where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.260
And what Gruber found was

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.260
that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.260
for months and months and months

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.260
before he had his alleged epiphany,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.260
reading Malthus in October of 1838.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.260
There are passages where you can read it,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.260
and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.260
from the period before he has this epiphany.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.260
had the idea, he had the concept,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.260
but was unable of fully thinking it yet.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.260
And that is actually how great ideas often happen;

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.260
they fade into view over long periods of time.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.260
Now the challenge for all of us is:

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.260
how do you create environments

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.260
that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.260
"I have an excellent idea for our organization.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.260
It will be useful in 2020.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.260
Could you just give me some time to do that?"

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
Now a couple of companies -- like Google --

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.260
they have innovation time off, 20 percent time,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.260
where, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.260
But that's a key thing.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.260
And the other thing is to allow those hunches

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.260
to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.260
You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.260
and if you're in the right environment,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.260
they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.260
So, in a sense,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.260
we often talk about the value

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260
of protecting intellectual property,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.260
you know, building barricades,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.260
having secretive R&amp;D labs, patenting everything that we have,

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.260
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.260
and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.260
and the culture will be more innovative.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.260
But I think there's a case to be made

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.260
that we should spend at least as much time, if not more,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.260
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
and not just protecting them.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.260
And I'll leave you with this story,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.260
which I think captures a lot of these values,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.260
and how it happens in unlikely ways.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.260
It's October of 1957,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
and Sputnik has just launched,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
and we're in Laurel Maryland,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.260
at the applied physics lab

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.260
associated with Johns Hopkins University.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.260
And it's Monday morning,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.260
and the news has just broken about this satellite

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.260
that's now orbiting the planet.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.260
And of course, this is nerd heaven, right?

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.260
There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.260
"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened."

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.260
And two of them,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.260
two 20-something researchers at the APL

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
are there at the cafeteria table

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.260
having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.260
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.260
And they start talking, and one of them says,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.260
"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.260
There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.260
that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.260
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.260
and everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.260
That's an interesting idea."

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.260
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.260
in microwave reception,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.260
and he's got a little antennae set up

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.260
with an amplifier in his office.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.260
and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.260
And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.260
because the Soviets made Sputnik

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.260
very easy to track.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.260
So they made it really easy to find it.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.260
So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
and people start kind of coming into the office and saying,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.260
"Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great."

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.260
And before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
We should record it."

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
And so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:10.260
and they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.260
And they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.260
for each little bleep that they record.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.260
And they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.260
small little frequency variations here.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.260
We could probably calculate the speed

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.260
that the satellite is traveling,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.260
if we do a little basic math here

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.260
using the Doppler effect."

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
And then they played around with it a little bit more,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.260
and they talked to a couple of their colleagues

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.260
who had other kind of specialties.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:38.260
And they said, "Jeez, you know,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.260
to figure out the points at which

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
the satellite is closest to our antennae

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.260
and the points at which it's farthest away.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.260
That's pretty cool."

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.260
And eventually, they get permission --

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.260
this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.260
They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.260
that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.260
They run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
of this satellite around the Earth,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
just from listening to this one little signal,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.260
going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.260
over lunch one morning.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.260
A couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.260
pulls them into the room and says,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.260
"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.260
about that project you were working on.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.260
You've figured out an unknown location

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.260
of a satellite orbiting the planet

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260
from a known location on the ground.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.260
Could you go the other way?

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.260
Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.260
if you knew the location of the satellite?"

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.260
And they thought about it and they said,

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here."

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.260
So they went back, and they thought about it.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.260
And they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.260
And he said, "Oh, that's great.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.260
Because see, I have these new nuclear submarines

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260
that I'm building.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260
And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.260
so that it will land right on top of Moscow,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.260
if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
So we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.260
and use it to track our submarines

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.260
Could you work on that problem?"

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.260
And that's how GPS was born.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.260
30 years later,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.260
Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.260
that anybody could kind of build upon

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.260
and anybody could come along and build new technology

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.260
that would create and innovate

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.260
on top of this open platform,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.260
left it open for anyone to do

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.260
pretty much anything they wanted with it.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.260
And now, I guarantee you

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.260
certainly half of this room, if not more,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.260
has a device sitting in their pocket right now

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.260
that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.260
And I bet you one of you, if not more,

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.260
has used said device and said satellite system

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.260
to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.260
(Laughter)

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.260
in the last day or last week, right?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.260
(Applause)

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.260
And that, I think,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.260
is a great case study, a great lesson

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.260
in the power, the marvelous, kind of unplanned

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
emergent, unpredictable power

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.260
of open innovative systems.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.260
When you build them right, they will be led to completely new directions

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.260
that the creators never even dreamed of.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.260
I mean, here you have these guys

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.260
who basically thought they were just following this hunch,

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.260
this little passion that had developed,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.260
then they thought they were fighting the Cold War,

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
and then it turns out they're just helping somebody

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.260
find a soy latte.

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.260
(Laughter)

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.260
That is how innovation happens.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.260
Chance favors the connected mind.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.260
Thank you very much.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.260
(Applause)
