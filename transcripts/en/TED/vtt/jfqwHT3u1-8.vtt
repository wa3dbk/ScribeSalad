00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.065
Openness. It's a word that

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:22.144
denotes opportunity and possibilities.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:24.184
Open-ended, open hearth,

00:00:24.184 --> 00:00:27.537
open source, open door policy,

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:31.073
open bar. (Laughter)

00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:33.593
And everywhere the world is opening up,

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:35.093
and it's a good thing.

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:36.869
Why is this happening?

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.833
The technology revolution is opening the world.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.378
Yesterday's Internet was a platform

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:44.970
for the presentation of content.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.225
The Internet of today is a platform for computation.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:49.832
The Internet is becoming a giant

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:52.433
global computer, and every time you go on it,

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.090
you upload a video, you do a Google search,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.744
you remix something,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.291
you're programming this big global computer

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:00.531
that we all share.

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:03.765
Humanity is building a machine,

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.839
and this enables us to collaborate in new ways.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.155
Collaboration can occur on

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.129
an astronomical basis.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.537
Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:17.226
I started studying kids about 15 years ago,

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:19.185
-- so actually 20 years ago now --

00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.780
and I noticed how my own children were

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.297
effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:25.514
and at first I thought,

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:28.479
"My children are prodigies!" (Laughter)

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.605
But then I noticed all their friends were like them,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.549
so that was a bad theory.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.544
So I've started working with a few hundred kids,

00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:37.139
and I came to the conclusion

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.197
that this is the first generation to come of age

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:40.331
in the digital age,

00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:41.952
to be bathed in bits.

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:44.288
I call them the Net Generation.

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:45.638
I said, these kids are different.

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.516
They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:49.977
It's like the air.

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:53.800
It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.330
And — (Laughter)

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.168
And there's no more powerful force to change

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:02.876
every institution than the first generation of digital natives.

00:02:02.876 --> 00:02:04.230
I'm a digital immigrant.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.171
I had to learn the language.

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.440
The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.470
Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.839
everything from old models of the corporation,

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.320
government, media, Wall Street,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.896
are in various stages of being stalled or frozen

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:24.822
or in atrophy or even failing,

00:02:24.822 --> 00:02:27.832
and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.

00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:29.661
I mean, think about Wall Street.

00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:32.872
The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down

00:02:32.872 --> 00:02:35.370
global capitalism.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.933
Now, you know the idea of a burning platform,

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:41.103
that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:44.304
become greater than the costs of moving to something different,

00:02:44.304 --> 00:02:47.477
perhaps something radically different.

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:49.205
And we need to change

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.298
and open up all of our institutions.

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:52.980
So this technology push,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.872
a demographic kick from a new generation

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:58.740
and a demand pull from a new

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.167
economic global environment

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:02.860
is causing the world to open up.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.980
Now, I think, in fact,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.183
we're at a turning point in human history,

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:11.128
where we can finally now rebuild

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:13.566
many of the institutions of the Industrial Age

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.123
around a new set of principles.

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.487
Now, what is openness?

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:19.062
Well, as it turns out, openness

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:21.304
has a number of different meanings,

00:03:21.304 --> 00:03:24.207
and for each there's a corresponding principle

00:03:24.207 --> 00:03:25.876
for the transformation of

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.900
civilization.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.175
The first is collaboration.

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.990
Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.949
of organizations becoming more porous and fluid

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.813
and open.

00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:40.349
The guy in the picture here,

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.478
I'll tell you his story.

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:43.383
His name is Rob McEwen.

00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:45.965
I'd like to say, "I have this think tank, we scour the world

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:47.619
for amazing case studies."

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.277
The reason I know this story

00:03:49.277 --> 00:03:53.438
is because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)

00:03:53.438 --> 00:03:55.205
He actually moved across the street from us,

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:56.484
and he held a cocktail party

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:58.929
to meet the neighbors, and he says, "You're Don Tapscott.

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:59.838
I've read some of your books."

00:03:59.838 --> 00:04:00.938
I said, "Great. What do you do?"

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:02.255
And he says, "Well I used to be a banker

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:03.703
and now I'm a gold miner."

00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:06.693
And he tells me this amazing story.

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:09.184
He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:10.471
can't tell him where the gold is.

00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:12.198
He gives them more money for geological data,

00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:13.827
they come back, they can't tell

00:04:13.827 --> 00:04:15.689
him where to go into production.

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.669
After a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.046
to give up, but he has an epiphany one day.

00:04:22.046 --> 00:04:24.820
He wonders, "If my geologists don't know where the gold is,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.190
maybe somebody else does."

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.193
So he does a "radical" thing.

00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:30.700
He takes his geological data,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.463
he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet

00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:34.954
called the Goldcorp Challenge.

00:04:34.954 --> 00:04:38.534
It's basically half a million dollars in prize money

00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:41.246
for anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:45.182
and if so, where is it? (Laughter)

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:47.329
He gets submissions from all around the world.

00:04:47.329 --> 00:04:49.586
They use techniques that he's never heard of,

00:04:49.586 --> 00:04:51.754
and for his half a million dollars in prize money,

00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:55.939
Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.712
The market value of his company

00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:00.030
goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.722
and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:06.212
he's a happy camper. (Laughter)

00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:09.900
You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.011
Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.

00:05:13.011 --> 00:05:15.516
He viewed talent differently.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.812
He wondered, who are their peers?

00:05:17.812 --> 00:05:21.881
He should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.

00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:24.212
You know, some of the best submissions

00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:26.443
didn't come from geologists.

00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:28.939
They came from computer scientists, engineers.

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.190
The winner was a computer graphics company

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.006
that built a three dimensional model of the mine

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:33.829
where you can helicopter underground

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:36.499
and see where the gold is.

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:39.602
He helped us understand that social media's becoming

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:41.675
social production.

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:43.419
It's not about hooking up online.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.494
This is a new means of production in the making.

00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:50.491
And this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,

00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:53.490
for uniquely qualified minds,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.225
was part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:00.683
and architecture of our organizations,

00:06:00.683 --> 00:06:04.285
and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,

00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:05.985
to create goods and services,

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:07.108
to engage with the rest of the world,

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:11.513
in terms of government, how we create public value.

00:06:11.513 --> 00:06:13.499
Openness is about collaboration.

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:15.865
Now secondly, openness is about transparency.

00:06:15.865 --> 00:06:18.055
This is different. Here, we're talking about the communication

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.890
of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.807
employees, customers, business partners, shareholders,

00:06:24.807 --> 00:06:26.569
and so on.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.842
And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.

00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:33.329
People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:35.785
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:38.490
You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.715
not just Julian Assange,

00:06:40.715 --> 00:06:43.306
have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:44.763
scrutinizing, informing others,

00:06:44.763 --> 00:06:48.353
and even organizing collective responses.

00:06:48.353 --> 00:06:50.643
Institutions are becoming naked,

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.450
and if you're going to be naked,

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.165
well, there's some corollaries that flow from that.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:56.028
I mean, one is,

00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:58.809
fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:03.130
You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.595
Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.575
because value is evidenced like never before.

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:09.539
You say you have good products.

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:10.580
They'd better be good.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.531
But you also need to have values.

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:15.474
You need to have integrity as part of your bones

00:07:15.474 --> 00:07:17.882
and your DNA as an organization,

00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:20.355
because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,

00:07:20.355 --> 00:07:24.344
and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:27.615
So this is good. It's not bad.

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:30.310
Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.293
And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.

00:07:34.293 --> 00:07:37.289
Now, the third meaning and corresponding principle

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.419
of openness is about sharing.

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.140
Now this is different than transparency.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.883
Transparency is about the communication of information.

00:07:43.883 --> 00:07:48.301
Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:50.571
And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.

00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:53.508
IBM gave away 400 million dollars of software

00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:55.609
to the Linux movement, and that gave them

00:07:55.609 --> 00:07:58.620
a multi-billion dollar payoff.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.580
Now, conventional wisdom says,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.315
"Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:05.618
and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.966
our lawyers and we're going to sue them."

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:11.379
Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:16.483
I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption,

00:08:16.483 --> 00:08:19.172
and rather than taking a business model innovation

00:08:19.172 --> 00:08:23.124
to correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution

00:08:23.124 --> 00:08:25.437
and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles

00:08:25.437 --> 00:08:27.469
is now suing children

00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:31.636
and is in danger of collapse.

00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.477
So we need to think differently about intellectual property.

00:08:34.477 --> 00:08:35.506
I'll give you an example.

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:38.388
The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.

00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:40.993
First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions

00:08:40.993 --> 00:08:43.347
in the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,

00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:48.508
and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,

00:08:48.508 --> 00:08:50.431
that they're about to fall off something

00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:51.952
called the patent cliff.

00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:52.720
Do you know about this?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.724
They're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:57.351
in the next 12 months.

00:08:57.351 --> 00:08:58.682
And what are you going to do,

00:08:58.682 --> 00:09:01.792
like, cut back on paper clips or something? No.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:06.505
We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.

00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:09.969
The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets

00:09:09.969 --> 00:09:13.904
in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.

00:09:13.904 --> 00:09:16.247
They need to start sharing

00:09:16.247 --> 00:09:17.705
clinical trial data,

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:21.976
and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,

00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:23.918
not just for the industry but

00:09:23.918 --> 00:09:26.709
for humanity.

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:29.114
Now, the fourth meaning

00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:31.260
of openness,

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.259
and corresponding principle, is about empowerment.

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:35.475
And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:38.949
Knowledge and intelligence is power,

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:41.788
and as it becomes more distributed, there's a

00:09:41.788 --> 00:09:44.333
concomitant distribution

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.964
and decentralization and disaggregation of power

00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:49.893
that's underway in the world today.

00:09:49.893 --> 00:09:52.983
The open world is bringing freedom.

00:09:52.983 --> 00:09:55.332
Now, take the Arab Spring.

00:09:55.332 --> 00:09:57.244
The debate about the role of social media

00:09:57.244 --> 00:09:59.238
and social change has been settled.

00:09:59.238 --> 00:10:02.476
You know, one word: Tunisia.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:04.822
And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.

00:10:04.822 --> 00:10:07.164
But in the Tunisian revolution,

00:10:07.164 --> 00:10:09.291
the new media didn't cause the revolution;

00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:11.071
it was caused by injustice.

00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:15.308
Social media didn't create the revolution;

00:10:15.308 --> 00:10:17.629
it was created by a new generation of young people

00:10:17.629 --> 00:10:19.437
who wanted jobs and hope and

00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:23.463
who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:26.528
But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration

00:10:26.528 --> 00:10:28.896
costs in business and government,

00:10:28.896 --> 00:10:31.653
it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,

00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:33.482
and even insurrection

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:35.574
in ways that people didn't understand.

00:10:35.574 --> 00:10:37.397
You know, during the Tunisian revolution,

00:10:37.397 --> 00:10:40.091
snipers associated with the regime were killing

00:10:40.091 --> 00:10:41.835
unarmed students in the street.

00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:44.856
So the students would take their mobile devices,

00:10:44.856 --> 00:10:47.509
take a picture, triangulate the location,

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:49.710
send that picture to friendly military units,

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.119
who'd come in and take out the snipers.

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:54.653
You think that social media is about hooking up online?

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:57.680
For these kids, it was a military tool

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.806
to defend unarmed people from murderers.

00:11:00.806 --> 00:11:02.939
It was a tool of self-defense.

00:11:02.939 --> 00:11:05.294
You know, as we speak today, young people

00:11:05.294 --> 00:11:07.304
are being killed in Syria,

00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:09.114
and up until three months ago,

00:11:09.114 --> 00:11:11.313
if you were injured on the street,

00:11:11.313 --> 00:11:12.765
an ambulance would pick you up,

00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:15.665
take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,

00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:18.144
and you'd come out with a bullet in your head.

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:21.055
So these 20-somethings created

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.349
an alternative health care system,

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.739
where what they did is they used Twitter and basic

00:11:25.739 --> 00:11:28.984
publicly available tools that when someone's injured,

00:11:28.984 --> 00:11:31.664
a car would show up, it would pick them up,

00:11:31.664 --> 00:11:34.223
take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get

00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:37.765
medical treatment, as opposed to being executed.

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:40.950
So this is a time of great change.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.584
Now, it's not without its problems.

00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:46.230
Up until two years ago,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.383
all revolutions in human history had a leadership,

00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:52.175
and when the old regime fell, the leadership

00:11:52.175 --> 00:11:53.153
and the organization would take power.

00:11:53.153 --> 00:11:55.678
Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast

00:11:55.678 --> 00:11:57.176
they create a vacuum, and

00:11:57.176 --> 00:11:58.911
politics abhors a vacuum,

00:11:58.911 --> 00:12:00.983
and unsavory forces can fill that,

00:12:00.983 --> 00:12:04.109
typically the old regime,

00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:06.455
or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.

00:12:06.455 --> 00:12:09.190
You can see this playing out today in Egypt.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.853
But that doesn't matter,

00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:12.990
because this is moving forward.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.966
The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.

00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:19.344
The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?

00:12:19.344 --> 00:12:21.486
(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.

00:12:21.486 --> 00:12:23.709
I mean, we're not putting this one back.

00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:27.442
The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.

00:12:27.442 --> 00:12:30.226
I think, at the end of these four days,

00:12:30.226 --> 00:12:32.992
that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history

00:12:32.992 --> 00:12:36.488
is a positive one, and it's towards openness.

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:38.969
If you go back a few hundred years,

00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:41.353
all around the world it was a very closed society.

00:12:41.353 --> 00:12:42.922
It was agrarian, and the means of production

00:12:42.922 --> 00:12:45.637
and political system was called feudalism, and knowledge

00:12:45.637 --> 00:12:49.575
was concentrated in the church and the nobility.

00:12:49.575 --> 00:12:51.182
People didn't know about things.

00:12:51.182 --> 00:12:53.657
There was no concept of progress.

00:12:53.657 --> 00:12:55.560
You were born, you lived your life and you died.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.156
But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,

00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:03.708
and, over time, the society opened up.

00:13:03.708 --> 00:13:05.749
People started to learn about things, and when they did,

00:13:05.749 --> 00:13:07.134
the institutions of feudal society appeared

00:13:07.134 --> 00:13:10.837
to be stalled, or frozen, or failing.

00:13:10.837 --> 00:13:13.613
It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible

00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:15.895
for medicine when people had knowledge.

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:17.842
So we saw the Protestant Reformation.

00:13:17.842 --> 00:13:19.712
Martin Luther called the printing press

00:13:19.712 --> 00:13:22.109
"God's highest act of grace."

00:13:22.109 --> 00:13:25.620
The creation of a corporation, science, the university,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.307
eventually the Industrial Revolution,

00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.481
and it was all good.

00:13:29.481 --> 00:13:31.628
But it came with a cost.

00:13:31.628 --> 00:13:34.340
And now, once again, the technology genie

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.660
is out of the bottle, but this time it's different.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.525
The printing press gave us access to the written word.

00:13:40.525 --> 00:13:43.984
The Internet enables each of us to be a producer.

00:13:43.984 --> 00:13:46.798
The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.

00:13:46.798 --> 00:13:48.708
The Internet gives us access,

00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:50.357
not just to information and knowledge, but

00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:53.733
to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people

00:13:53.733 --> 00:13:55.270
on a global basis.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.509
To me, this is not an information age,

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:01.383
it's an age of networked intelligence.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:05.255
It's an age of vast promise,

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:08.383
an age of collaboration,

00:14:08.383 --> 00:14:12.562
where the boundaries of our organizations are changing,

00:14:12.562 --> 00:14:15.277
of transparency, where sunlight

00:14:15.277 --> 00:14:18.500
is disinfecting civilization,

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.056
an age of sharing and understanding

00:14:22.056 --> 00:14:23.762
the new power of the commons,

00:14:23.762 --> 00:14:26.405
and it's an age of empowerment

00:14:26.405 --> 00:14:29.296
and of freedom.

00:14:29.296 --> 00:14:32.832
Now, what I'd like to do is,

00:14:32.832 --> 00:14:35.480
to close, to share with you

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.089
some research that I've been doing.

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:40.600
I've tried to study all kinds of organizations

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.737
to understand what the future might look like,

00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:46.762
but I've been studying nature recently.

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:50.392
You know, bees come in swarms

00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:53.103
and fish come in schools.

00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:55.916
Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh,

00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:57.399
in the moors of England,

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:59.493
come in something called a murmuration,

00:14:59.493 --> 00:15:02.265
and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings

00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:04.178
of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings

00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:06.043
are out over a 20-mile radius

00:15:06.043 --> 00:15:08.084
sort of doing their starling thing.

00:15:08.084 --> 00:15:09.848
And at night they come together

00:15:09.848 --> 00:15:11.970
and they create one of the most spectacular things

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.565
in all of nature,

00:15:13.565 --> 00:15:15.619
and it's called a murmuration.

00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:18.536
And scientists that have studied this have said

00:15:18.536 --> 00:15:20.282
they've never seen an accident.

00:15:20.282 --> 00:15:22.232
Now, this thing has a function.

00:15:22.232 --> 00:15:24.094
It protects the birds.

00:15:24.094 --> 00:15:25.694
You can see on the right here,

00:15:25.694 --> 00:15:30.199
there's a predator being chased away by the collective power

00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:33.189
of the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:36.653
if you're a predator of starlings.

00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:39.101
And there's leadership,

00:15:39.101 --> 00:15:41.239
but there's no one leader.

00:15:41.239 --> 00:15:43.340
Now, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.786
or could we actually learn something from this?

00:15:45.786 --> 00:15:48.842
Well, the murmuration functions to record

00:15:48.842 --> 00:15:50.205
a number of principles,

00:15:50.205 --> 00:15:51.724
and they're basically the principles that

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:53.638
I have described to you today.

00:15:53.638 --> 00:15:56.444
This is a huge collaboration.

00:15:56.444 --> 00:15:58.223
It's an openness, it's a sharing

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:00.738
of all kinds of information, not just about location

00:16:00.738 --> 00:16:05.753
and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.

00:16:05.753 --> 00:16:09.890
And there's a real sense of interdependence,

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.577
that the individual birds somehow understand

00:16:13.577 --> 00:16:16.536
that their interests are in the interest of the collective.

00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:18.785
Perhaps like we should understand

00:16:18.785 --> 00:16:22.953
that business can't succeed

00:16:22.953 --> 00:16:25.113
in a world that's failing.

00:16:25.113 --> 00:16:26.670
Well, I look at this thing,

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.357
and I get a lot of hope.

00:16:29.357 --> 00:16:34.409
Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and

00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:37.265
you see something like this that's underway.

00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:41.405
And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:

00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:45.350
What if we could connect ourselves in this world

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.195
through a vast network of air and glass?

00:16:49.195 --> 00:16:52.027
Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?

00:16:52.027 --> 00:16:54.536
Could we start to share our intelligence?

00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:56.978
Could we create some kind of

00:16:56.978 --> 00:16:58.699
collective intelligence

00:16:58.699 --> 00:17:02.619
that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team

00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:06.767
to create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness

00:17:06.767 --> 00:17:07.992
on a global basis?

00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:11.665
Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.

00:17:11.665 --> 00:17:13.536
And I look at this thing,

00:17:13.536 --> 00:17:16.451
and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this

00:17:16.451 --> 00:17:20.247
smaller, networked, open world

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:23.351
that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that

00:17:23.351 --> 00:17:26.664
this new age of networked intelligence could be

00:17:26.664 --> 00:17:29.288
an age of promise fulfilled

00:17:29.288 --> 00:17:32.318
and of peril unrequited.

00:17:32.318 --> 00:17:35.664
Let's do this. Thank you.

00:17:35.664 --> 00:17:45.290
(Applause)
