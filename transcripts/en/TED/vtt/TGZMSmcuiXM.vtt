00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:14.948
I'm going to ask and try to answer,

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:19.846
in some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:22.200
Both civilians, obviously, and soldiers

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.286
suffer in war;

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:26.750
I don't think any civilian has ever missed

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.112
the war that they were subjected to.

00:00:30.112 --> 00:00:32.130
I've been covering wars for almost 20 years,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.458
and one of the remarkable things for me

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:39.342
is how many soldiers find themselves missing it.

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:41.647
How is it someone can go through

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:43.984
the worst experience imaginable,

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:45.960
and come home, back to their home,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.421
and their family, their country, and miss the war?

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:52.992
How does that work? What does it mean?

00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:56.450
We have to answer that question,

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.317
because if we don't, it'll be impossible

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:00.585
to bring soldiers back

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:04.640
to a place in society where they belong,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.893
and I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,

00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:09.911
if we don't understand how that mechanism works.

00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:13.173
The problem is that war

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:17.010
does not have a simple, neat truth,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.709
one simple, neat truth.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.970
Any sane person hates war,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.825
hates the idea of war,

00:01:23.825 --> 00:01:26.402
wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.518
doesn't want to be near it,
doesn't want to know about it.

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:32.202
That's a sane response to war.

00:01:32.202 --> 00:01:34.969
But if I asked all of you in this room,

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.327
who here has paid money

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:40.313
to go to a cinema

00:01:40.313 --> 00:01:43.703
and be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:47.261
most of you would probably raise your hands.

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:49.857
That's what's so complicated about war.

00:01:49.857 --> 00:01:53.397
And trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people

00:01:53.397 --> 00:01:56.636
finds something compelling about war,

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:59.379
so do 20-year-old soldiers

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.641
who have been trained in it, I promise you.

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.945
That's the thing that has to be understood.

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:08.767
I've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:11.393
but my most intense experiences in combat

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:15.625
were with American soldiers in Afghanistan.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:16.940
I've been in Africa, the Middle East,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.690
Afghanistan in the '90s,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.537
but it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:25.170
that I was confronted with

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690
very intense combat.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.730
I was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.563
in eastern Afghanistan.

00:02:31.563 --> 00:02:33.349
It was six miles long.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.491
There were 150 men of
Battle Company in that valley,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.025
and for a while, while I was there,

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.301
almost 20 percent of all the combat

00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:44.097
in all of Afghanistan was happening

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:45.930
in those six miles.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.481
A hundred and fifty men were absorbing

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.633
almost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.159
in the country, for a couple months.

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.296
It was very intense.

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:58.365
I spent most of my time at a small outpost

00:02:58.365 --> 00:02:59.939
called Restrepo.

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.499
It was named after the platoon medic

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.353
that had been killed about two
months into the deployment.

00:03:04.353 --> 00:03:08.293
It was a few plywood B-huts

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:12.102
clinging to a side of a ridge,

00:03:12.102 --> 00:03:16.879
and sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.690
and there were 20 men up there

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.775
of Second Platoon, Battle Company.

00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:22.375
I spent most of my time up there.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:23.990
There was no running water.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.001
There was no way to bathe.

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.440
The guys were up there for a month at a time.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.964
They never even got out of their clothes.

00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:31.114
They fought. The worked.

00:03:31.114 --> 00:03:33.860
They slept in the same clothes.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.339
They never took them off,
and at the end of the month,

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.650
they went back down to the company headquarters,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.717
and by then, their clothes were unwearable.

00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:42.010
They burned them and got a new set.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.720
There was no Internet. There was no phone.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.629
There was no communication
with the outside world up there.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.459
There was no cooked food.

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.030
There was nothing up there

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.930
that young men typically like:

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.211
no cars, no girls, no television, nothing

00:03:58.211 --> 00:04:00.075
except combat.

00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:04.036
Combat they did learn to like.

00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:06.487
I remember one day, it was a very hot day

00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:08.253
in the spring,

00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:10.634
and we hadn't been in a fight

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:13.080
in a couple of weeks, maybe.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.644
Usually, the outpost was attacked,

00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:18.507
and we hadn't seen any
combat in a couple of weeks,

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:21.110
and everyone was just stunned

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.267
with boredom and heat.

00:04:23.267 --> 00:04:27.801
And I remember the lieutenant walking past me

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.274
sort of stripped to the waist.

00:04:29.274 --> 00:04:31.676
It was incredibly hot.

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:34.040
Stripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.792
"Oh God, please someone attack us today."

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.142
That's how bored they were.

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:42.208
That's war too, is a lieutenant saying,

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:44.868
"Please make something happen

00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:46.911
because we're going crazy."

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.259
To understand that,

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.169
you have to, for a moment,

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.570
think about combat not morally --

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.455
that's an important job to do —

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:57.348
but for a moment, don't think about it morally,

00:04:57.348 --> 00:05:00.219
think about it neurologically.

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:02.431
Let's think about what happens in your brain

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:04.804
when you're in combat.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:07.156
First of all, the experience

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:11.770
is very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.760
It's not what I had expected.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.490
Usually, you're not scared.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.610
I've been very scared in combat,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.712
but most of the time when I was out there,

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:21.839
I wasn't scared.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.366
I was very scared beforehand

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.281
and incredibly scared afterwards,

00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:27.883
and that fear that comes afterwards can last years.

00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:29.835
I haven't been shot at in six years,

00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:32.188
and I was woken up very abruptly this morning

00:05:32.188 --> 00:05:35.433
by a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:36.640
six years later.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.374
I've never even been strafed by aircraft,

00:05:38.374 --> 00:05:41.750
and I was having nightmares about it.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.123
Time slows down.

00:05:43.123 --> 00:05:45.347
You get this weird tunnel vision.

00:05:45.347 --> 00:05:49.008
You notice some details very, very, very accurately

00:05:49.008 --> 00:05:51.195
and other things drop out.

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:54.158
It's almost a slightly altered state of mind.

00:05:54.158 --> 00:05:55.629
What's happening in your brain

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.346
is you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline

00:05:58.346 --> 00:06:00.166
pumped through your system.

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:02.760
Young men will go to great lengths

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.096
to have that experience.

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:08.018
It's wired into us.

00:06:08.018 --> 00:06:11.860
It's hormonally supported.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.745
The mortality rate for young men in society

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:18.165
is six times what it is for young women

00:06:18.165 --> 00:06:19.970
from violence and from accidents,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.159
just the stupid stuff that young men do:

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:24.461
jumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,

00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:26.880
lighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.118
I mean, you know what I'm talking about.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:31.159
They die at six times the rate

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.599
that young women do.

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.503
Statistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,

00:06:36.503 --> 00:06:39.146
you would be safer in the fire department

00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:41.710
or the police department in most American cities

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.232
than just walking around the
streets of your hometown

00:06:44.232 --> 00:06:46.590
looking for something to do,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:49.640
statistically.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.888
You can imagine how that plays out in combat.

00:06:52.888 --> 00:06:55.950
At Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.644
including me,

00:06:57.644 --> 00:06:59.704
including my good friend Tim Hetherington,

00:06:59.704 --> 00:07:02.126
who was later killed in Libya.

00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:03.802
There were guys walking around

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:05.623
with bullet holes in their uniforms,

00:07:05.623 --> 00:07:07.510
rounds that had cut through the fabric

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.892
and didn't touch their bodies.

00:07:10.892 --> 00:07:13.974
I was leaning against some sandbags one morning,

00:07:13.974 --> 00:07:16.971
not much going on, sort of spacing out,

00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.478
and some sand was kicked into the side of,

00:07:20.478 --> 00:07:23.148
sort of hit the side of my face.

00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:25.361
Something hit the side of my face,
and I didn't know what it was.

00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.900
You have to understand about bullets

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.798
that they go a lot faster than sound,

00:07:28.798 --> 00:07:30.211
so if someone shoots at you

00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:32.268
from a few hundred meters,

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:35.411
the bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,

00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:38.063
half a second or so before
the sound catches up to it.

00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:40.950
So I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.950
Half a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.964
It was machine gun fire.

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:46.310
It was the first round, the first burst

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.173
of an hour-long firefight.

00:07:49.173 --> 00:07:52.238
What had happened was the bullet hit,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:55.981
a bullet hit three or four inches
from the side of my head.

00:07:55.981 --> 00:08:00.630
Imagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:02.510
think about the angle of deviation that saved my life.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.972
At 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.

00:08:04.972 --> 00:08:09.268
Just think about the math on that.

00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:11.052
Every guy up there

00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:12.974
had some experience like that,

00:08:12.974 --> 00:08:16.502
at least once, if not many times.

00:08:16.502 --> 00:08:18.982
The boys are up there for a year.

00:08:18.982 --> 00:08:20.751
They got back.

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.110
Some of them got out of the Army

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.704
and had tremendous psychological
problems when they got home.

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.239
Some of them stayed in the Army

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:29.862
and were more or less okay, psychologically.

00:08:29.862 --> 00:08:32.939
I was particularly close to a
guy named Brendan O'Byrne.

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:34.827
I'm still very good friends with him.

00:08:34.827 --> 00:08:37.883
He came back to the States. He got out of the Army.

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:39.851
I had a dinner party one night.

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:41.645
I invited him,

00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:45.080
and he started talking with a woman,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.317
one of my friends,

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:49.369
and she knew how bad it had been out there,

00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:51.118
and she said, "Brendan,

00:08:51.118 --> 00:08:54.446
is there anything at all that you miss about

00:08:54.446 --> 00:08:58.000
being out in Afghanistan, about the war?"

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.169
And he thought about it quite a long time,

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:06.552
and finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

00:09:06.552 --> 00:09:09.994
And he's one of the most traumatized people

00:09:09.994 --> 00:09:13.083
I've seen from that war.

00:09:13.083 --> 00:09:15.094
"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."

00:09:15.094 --> 00:09:18.179
What is he talking about?

00:09:18.179 --> 00:09:21.621
He's not a psychopath.

00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:23.280
He doesn't miss killing people.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.560
He's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.262
and seeing his friends get killed.

00:09:27.262 --> 00:09:31.090
What is it that he misses? We have to answer that.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:37.816
If we're going to stop war, we
have to answer that question.

00:09:37.816 --> 00:09:42.994
I think what he missed is brotherhood.

00:09:42.994 --> 00:09:44.750
He missed, in some ways,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.146
the opposite of killing.

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:48.478
What he missed was connection

00:09:48.478 --> 00:09:50.826
to the other men he was with.

00:09:50.826 --> 00:09:53.342
Now, brotherhood is different from friendship.

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:57.096
Friendship happens in society, obviously.

00:09:57.096 --> 00:09:58.634
The more you like someone,

00:09:58.634 --> 00:10:00.708
the more you'd be willing to do for them.

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:02.214
Brotherhood has nothing to do

00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:05.706
with how you feel about the other person.

00:10:05.706 --> 00:10:08.688
It's a mutual agreement in a group

00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:10.930
that you will put the welfare of the group,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.950
you will put the safety of everyone in the group

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.810
above your own.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.187
In effect, you're saying,

00:10:18.187 --> 00:10:23.602
"I love these other people more than I love myself."

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:25.000
Brendan was a team leader

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.863
in command of three men,

00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:30.300
and the worst day in Afghanistan —

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.179
He was almost killed so many times.

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:34.514
It didn't bother him.

00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:37.092
The worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan

00:10:37.092 --> 00:10:39.908
was one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet

00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:44.392
in the helmet, knocked him over.

00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:45.520
They thought he was dead.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.970
It was in the middle of a huge firefight.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.990
No one could deal with it, and a minute later,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.030
Kyle Steiner sat back up

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.955
from the dead, as it were,

00:10:52.955 --> 00:10:54.980
because he'd come back to consciousness.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.252
The bullet had just knocked him out.

00:10:56.252 --> 00:10:58.179
It glanced off the helmet.

00:10:58.179 --> 00:11:00.245
He remembers people saying,

00:11:00.245 --> 00:11:01.707
as he was sort of half-conscious,

00:11:01.707 --> 00:11:05.206
he remembers people saying,

00:11:05.206 --> 00:11:07.277
"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."

00:11:07.277 --> 00:11:08.899
And he was thinking, "I'm not dead."

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:10.647
And he sat up.

00:11:10.647 --> 00:11:12.844
And Brendan realized after that

00:11:12.844 --> 00:11:14.485
that he could not protect his men,

00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:16.863
and that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,

00:11:16.863 --> 00:11:19.828
was realizing that.

00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:22.340
That's brotherhood.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.772
This wasn't invented recently.

00:11:24.772 --> 00:11:27.269
Many of you have probably read "The Iliad."

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:29.240
Achilles surely would have risked his life

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.018
or given his life to save his friend Patroclus.

00:11:34.018 --> 00:11:36.956
In World War II, there were many stories

00:11:36.956 --> 00:11:40.032
of soldiers who were wounded,

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.099
were brought to a rear base hospital,

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:43.455
who went AWOL,

00:11:43.455 --> 00:11:45.675
crawled out of windows, slipped out doors,

00:11:45.675 --> 00:11:49.273
went AWOL, wounded,

00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:50.675
to make their way back to the front lines

00:11:50.675 --> 00:11:53.311
to rejoin their brothers out there.

00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:55.660
So you think about Brendan,

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.016
you think about all these soldiers

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:01.901
having an experience like that, a bond like that,

00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:03.781
in a small group,

00:12:03.781 --> 00:12:05.679
where they loved 20 other people

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:08.598
in some ways more than they loved themselves,

00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:13.714
you think about how good that would feel, imagine it,

00:12:13.714 --> 00:12:18.344
and they are blessed with that experience for a year,

00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:19.833
and then they come home,

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:22.820
and they are just back in society

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.659
like the rest of us are,

00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.085
not knowing who they can count on,

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:33.262
not knowing who loves them, who they can love,

00:12:33.262 --> 00:12:35.853
not knowing exactly what anyone they know

00:12:35.853 --> 00:12:38.087
would do for them if it came down to it.

00:12:38.087 --> 00:12:41.673
That is terrifying.

00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:43.663
Compared to that,

00:12:43.663 --> 00:12:47.737
war, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,

00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:50.234
compared to that kind of alienation.

00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:51.624
That's why they miss it,

00:12:51.624 --> 00:12:54.102
and that's what we have to understand

00:12:54.102 --> 00:12:57.505
and in some ways fix in our society.

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:00.435
Thank you very much.

00:13:00.435 --> 00:13:03.390
(Applause)
