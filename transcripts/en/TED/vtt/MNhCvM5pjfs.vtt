00:00:17.047 --> 00:00:20.040
I was sitting with my girls,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.553
and Joy said,

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:25.531
"Dang, I wish he'd get off my back.

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:29.387
My daddy, he calls me all the time."

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:32.653
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.

00:00:32.653 --> 00:00:36.313
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:40.545
At this moment, I knew the girls needed a way

00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:43.122
to connect with their fathers.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.885
At Camp Diva, my non-profit organization,

00:00:46.885 --> 00:00:50.422
we have these types of conversations all the time

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:53.614
as a way to help girls of African descent

00:00:53.614 --> 00:00:57.196
prepare for their passage into womanhood.

00:00:57.196 --> 00:01:00.737
These girls just needed

00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:04.578
a way to invite their fathers into their lives

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:07.275
on their own terms.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:08.728
So I asked the girls,

00:01:08.728 --> 00:01:11.864
"How can we help other girls

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:16.154
develop healthy relationships with their fathers?"

00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:20.657
"Let's have a dance," one girl shouted,

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:24.990
and all the girls quickly backed her up.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.896
They started dreaming about the decorations,

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:31.310
invitations, the dresses they were going to wear,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.456
and what their fathers could and could not wear. (Laughter)

00:01:35.456 --> 00:01:40.027
It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes,

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:44.097
but even if I could have slowed down those girls,

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:45.437
I wouldn't have,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.518
because one thing that I have learned

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.596
from over a decade of working with girls

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:54.116
is that they already know what they need.

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:58.793
The wisdom lives inside of them.

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:01.441
As long as they have infrastructure,

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:03.857
mentorship and resources,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:07.275
they can build what they need,

00:02:07.275 --> 00:02:12.709
not only to survive, but to thrive.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.933
So we had a dance,

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:21.473
and girls and their fathers came in multitudes.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.448
They were dressed to the nines.

00:02:24.448 --> 00:02:26.691
They acted sweet.

00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.377
(Laughter)

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:32.227
They acted silly.

00:02:32.227 --> 00:02:35.448
They really enjoyed each other's company.

00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:38.289
It was a huge success.

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:43.500
And the girls decided to make it an annual event.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.092
So as the seasons changed,

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:48.812
and it was time to plan the dance again,

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:51.919
one girl named Brianna spoke up,

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.109
and she said,

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.855
"My dad can't come to the dance,

00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:01.092
and this whole thing is making me sad."

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:04.100
"Why not?" the girls asked.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.780
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.714
"Well, can he just get out for a day?" one of the girls asked. (Laughter)

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:16.892
"And come in shackles?

00:03:16.892 --> 00:03:21.237
That's worse than not having him here at all."

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:25.655
At this moment, I saw an opportunity

00:03:25.655 --> 00:03:28.581
for the girls to rise to the occasion

00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:31.345
and to become their own heroes.

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:36.018
So I asked, "What do you think we should do about this?

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:41.268
We want every girl to experience the dance, right?"

00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:42.931
So the girls thought for a moment,

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.240
and one girl suggested,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.546
"Why don't we just take the dance in the jail?"

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:53.362
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that,

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:56.156
and said, "Are you crazy?

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:59.164
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls,

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:01.628
dressed up — " (Laughter)

00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:07.215
" — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits?"

00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:10.563
Because that's what they called them.

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:14.721
I said, "Girls, well, well,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.724
you never know unless you ask."

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:23.164
So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff,

00:04:23.164 --> 00:04:26.983
signed collectively by each girl,

00:04:26.983 --> 00:04:32.389
and I would have to say, he is a very special sheriff.

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.322
He contacted me immediately and said,

00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:43.276
whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside,

00:04:43.276 --> 00:04:46.448
his doors are always open.

00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:48.773
Because one thing he did know,

00:04:48.773 --> 00:04:52.100
that when fathers are connected to their children,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.063
it is less likely that they will return.

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:59.144
So,

00:04:59.144 --> 00:05:04.998
16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.

00:05:04.998 --> 00:05:08.647
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best,

00:05:08.647 --> 00:05:13.676
and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:18.180
for shirts and ties.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.551
They hugged.

00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:25.302
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish.

00:05:25.302 --> 00:05:29.027
They laughed together.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:33.435
It was beautiful.

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:37.676
The fathers and daughters even experienced

00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:41.751
an opportunity to have a physical connection,

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:44.480
something that a lot of them didn't even have

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.712
for a while.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.123
Fathers were in a space where they were able to

00:05:50.123 --> 00:05:52.836
make their daughter's plate,

00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:59.085
and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:02.762
Even the guards cried.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.482
But after the dance,

00:06:05.482 --> 00:06:11.042
we all realized that Dad still would be in jail.

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:14.135
So we needed to create something

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:15.893
that they could take with them.

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:18.508
So we brought in Flip cams,

00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:21.249
and we had them look at the Flip cams

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:22.977
and just interview each other --

00:06:22.977 --> 00:06:26.691
their messages, their thoughts.

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.874
This was going to be used as a touchstone

00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:32.290
so when they started to miss each other

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.590
and feel disconnected,

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.954
they could reconnect through this image.

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:43.336
I'll never forget that one girl looked in her father's eyes

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.656
with that camera and said,

00:06:44.656 --> 00:06:51.366
"Daddy, when you look at me, what do you see?"

00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:55.454
Because our daddies are our mirrors

00:06:55.454 --> 00:06:57.876
that we reflect back on

00:06:57.876 --> 00:07:02.646
when we decide about what type of man we deserve,

00:07:02.646 --> 00:07:06.237
and how they see us for the rest of our lives.

00:07:06.237 --> 00:07:09.782
I know that very well,

00:07:09.782 --> 00:07:12.183
because I was one of the lucky girls.

00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:14.442
I have had

00:07:18.058 --> 00:07:24.065
my father in my life always.

00:07:24.065 --> 00:07:25.945
He's even here today.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:34.982
(Applause)

00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:38.960
And that is why it is extremely special

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.204
for me to make sure that these girls

00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:44.734
are connected to their fathers,

00:07:44.734 --> 00:07:47.643
especially those who are separated

00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:52.529
because of barbed wires and metal doors.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:55.622
We have just created a form

00:07:55.622 --> 00:07:59.005
for girls who have heavy questions on their heart

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:03.497
to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions

00:08:03.497 --> 00:08:08.264
and given the fathers the freedom to answer.

00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:11.609
Because we know that the fathers

00:08:11.609 --> 00:08:14.857
are even leaving with this one thought:

00:08:14.857 --> 00:08:20.226
What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world?

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:23.643
Because a father is locked in

00:08:23.643 --> 00:08:26.693
does not mean he should be locked out

00:08:26.693 --> 00:08:29.244
of his daughter's life.

00:08:29.244 --> 00:08:40.997
(Applause)
