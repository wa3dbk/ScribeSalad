00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.260
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.260
I've got something to show you.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.260
(Laughter)

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Think about this as a pixel, a flying pixel.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
This is what we call, in our lab, sensible design.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Let me tell you a bit about it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.260
Now if you take this picture -- I'm Italian originally,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.260
and every boy in Italy grows up

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.260
with this picture on the wall of his bedroom --

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.260
but the reason I'm showing you this

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.260
is that something very interesting

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.260
happened in Formula 1 racing

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.260
over the past couple of decades.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Now some time ago,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.260
if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
you take a budget, and you bet your budget

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.260
on a good driver and a good car.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
Now today, if you want to win the race,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
actually you need also something like this --

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
something that monitors the car in real time,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
has a few thousand sensors

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
collecting information from the car,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.260
transmitting this information into the system,

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.260
and then processing it

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.260
and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
and changing things in real time

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.260
as information is collected.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
This is what, in engineering terms,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.260
you would call a real time control system.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.260
And basically, it's a system made of two components --

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.260
a sensing and an actuating component.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.260
What is interesting today

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
is that real time control systems

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
are starting to enter into our lives.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
Our cities, over the past few years,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.260
just have been blanketed

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.260
with networks, electronics.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
They're becoming like computers in open air.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
And, as computers in open air,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.260
they're starting to respond in a different way

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.260
to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.260
If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.260
Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.260
cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.260
but they are 50 percent of the world's population.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.260
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.260
up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260
Beyond cities,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
all of this sensing and actuating

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
is entering our everyday objects.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260
That's from an exhibition that

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
Paola Antonelli is organizing

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.260
at MoMA later this year, during the summer.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.260
It's called "Talk to Me."

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.260
Well our objects, our environment

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
is starting to talk back to us.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.260
with the environment out there.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
In a certain sense,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.260
you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.260
at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.260
actually you can still see a small chip underneath --

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.260
and said, shouted,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
"Perché non parli? Why don't you talk?"

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
Well today, for the first time,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.260
our environment is starting to talk back to us.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.260
And I'll show just a few examples --

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.260
again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
Let's starting with sensing.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.260
Well, the first project I wanted to share with you

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
is actually one of the first projects by our lab.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.260
It was four and a half years ago in Italy.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.260
And what we did there

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
was actually use a new type of network at the time

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
that had been deployed all across the world --

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.260
that's a cellphone network --

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.260
and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.260
that's collected anyway by the operator,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.260
in order to understand

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.260
how the city works.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.260
It's when Italy won the soccer World Cup.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.260
Some of you might remember, it was Italy and France playing,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.260
and then Zidane at the end, the headbutt.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.260
And anyway, Italy won at the end.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.260
(Laughter)

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.260
Now look at what happened that day

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.260
just by monitoring activity

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.260
happening on the network.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.260
Here you see the city.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.260
You see the Colosseum in the middle,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.260
the river Tiber.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260
It's morning, before the match.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.260
You see the timeline on the top.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.260
Early afternoon,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.260
people here and there,

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.260
making calls and moving.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.260
The match begins -- silence.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
France scores. Italy scores.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
Halftime, people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.260
Second half. End of normal time.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.260
First overtime, second.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260
Zidane, the headbutt in a moment.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.260
Italy wins. Yeah.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.260
(Laughter)

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.260
(Applause)

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
Well, that night, everybody went to celebrate in the center.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
You saw the big peak.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
The following day, again everybody went to the center

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.260
to meet the winning team

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.260
and the prime minister at the time.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260
And then everybody moved down.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
You see the image of the place called Circo Massimo,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.260
where, since Roman times, people go to celebrate,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.260
to have a big party, and you see the peak at the end of the day.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Well, that's just one example of how we can sense the city today

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.260
in a way that we couldn't have done

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.260
just a few years ago.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.260
Another quick example about sensing:

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.260
it's not about people,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.260
but about things we use and consume.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.260
Well today, we know everything

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.260
about where our objects come from.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.260
This is a map that shows you

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.260
all the chips that form a Mac computer, how they came together.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.260
But we know very little about where things go.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.260
So in this project,

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.260
we actually developed some small tags

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.260
to track trash as it moves through the system.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.260
So we actually started with a number of volunteers

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.260
who helped us in Seattle,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.260
just over a year ago,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.260
to tag what they were throwing away --

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.260
different types of things, as you can see here --

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
things they would throw away anyway.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
Then we put a little chip, little tag,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.260
onto the trash

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.260
and then started following it.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.260
Here are the results we just obtained.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
(Music)

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.260
From Seattle ...

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.260
after one week.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.260
With this information we realized

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.260
there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.260
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
This data was not available before.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.260
But there's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.260
But the other thing is that we believe

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.260
that if we see every day

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.260
that the cup we're throwing away, it doesn't disappear,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.260
it's still somewhere on the planet.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.260
And the plastic bottle we're throwing away every day still stays there.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260
And if we show that to people,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
then we can also promote some behavioral change.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.260
So that was the reason for the project.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.260
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.260
he could tell you much more about sensing

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.260
and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing,

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260
but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.260
and that's actuating our environment.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.260
And the first project

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.260
is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza, Spain.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.260
It started with a question by the mayor of the city,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.260
who came to us saying

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.260
that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.260
of using water in public space, in architecture.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.260
And the question was: How could technology, new technology,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.260
be added to that?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.260
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.260
was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.260
solenoid valves, taps,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.260
opening and closing.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.260
You create like a water curtain with pixels made of water.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.260
If those pixels fall,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.260
you can write on it,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
you can show patterns, images, text.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.260
And even you can approach it, and it will open up

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260
to let you jump through,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
as you see in this image.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
Well, we presented this to Mayor Belloch.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.260
He liked it very much.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260
And we got a commission to design a building

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.260
at the entrance of the expo.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.260
We called it Digital Water Pavilion.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.260
The whole building is made of water.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.260
There's no doors or windows,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
but when you approach it,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.260
it will open up to let you in.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.260
(Music)

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.260
The roof also is covered with water.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.260
And if there's a bit of wind,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.260
if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.260
Or you could close the building,

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.260
and the whole architecture will disappear,

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.260
like in this case.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.260
You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.260
when they take the roof down,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.260
of people who have been there and said, "They demolished the building."

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.260
No, they didn't demolish it, just when it goes down,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.260
the architecture almost disappears.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.260
Here's the building working.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260
You see the person puzzled about what was going on inside.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.260
And here was myself trying not to get wet,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.260
testing the sensors that open the water.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.260
Well, I should tell you now what happened one night

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.260
when all of the sensors stopped working.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
But actually that night, it was even more fun.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.260
All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.260
because the way of engaging with the building became something different.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.260
but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.260
and you had to jump without getting wet.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:10:06.260
(Video) (Crowd Noise)

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.260
And that was, for us, was very interesting,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.260
because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.260
we always think about how people will use the things we design.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.260
But then reality's always unpredictable.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.260
And that's the beauty of doing things

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.260
that are used and interact with people.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
Here is an image then of the building

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.260
with the physical pixels, the pixels made of water,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.260
and then projections on them.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.260
And this is what led us to think about

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
the following project I'll show you now.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.260
That's, imagine those pixels could actually start flying.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.260
Imagine you could have small helicopters

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.260
that move in the air,

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.260
and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights --

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.260
almost as a cloud that can move in space.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.260
Here is the video.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:53.260
(Music)

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:56.260
So imagine one helicopter,

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.260
like the one we saw before,

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.260
moving with others,

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.260
in synchrony.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.260
So you can have this cloud.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.260
You can have a kind of flexible screen or display, like this --

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.260
a regular configuration in two dimensions.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.260
Or in regular, but in three dimensions,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.260
where the thing that changes is the light,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
not the pixels' position.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.260
You can play with a different type.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
Imagine your screen could just appear

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.260
in different scales or sizes,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.260
different types of resolution.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.260
But then the whole thing can be

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
just a 3D cloud of pixels

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.260
that you can approach and move through it

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.260
and see from many, many directions.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.260
Here is the real Flyfire

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.260
control and going down to form the regular grid as before.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.260
When you turn on the light, actually you see this. So the same as we saw before.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.260
And imagine each of them then controlled by people.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.260
You can have each pixel

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.260
having an input that comes from people,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.260
from people's movement, or so and so.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
I want to show you something here for the first time.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.260
We've been working with Roberto Bolle,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.260
one of today's top ballet dancers --

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.260
the étoile at Metropolitan in New York

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.260
and La Scala in Milan --

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.260
and actually captured his movement in 3D

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.260
in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.260
And here you can see Roberto dancing.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.260
You see on the left the pixels,

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.260
the different resolutions being captured.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.260
It's both 3D scanning in real time

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.260
and motion capture.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.260
So you can reconstruct a whole movement.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.260
You can go all the way through.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.260
But then, once we have the pixels, then you can play with them

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.260
and play with color and movement

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.260
and gravity and rotation.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.260
So we want to use this as one of the possible inputs

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.260
for Flyfire.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.260
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.260
It's something we're working on for the London Olympics.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.260
It's called The Cloud.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And the idea here is, imagine, again,

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
we can involve people

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.260
in doing something and changing our environment --

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.260
almost to impart what we call cloud raising --

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.260
like barn raising, but with a cloud.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.260
Imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.260
And I think what is remarkable

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.260
that has happened over the past couple of years

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.260
is that, over the past couple of decades,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.260
we went from the physical world to the digital one.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.260
This has been digitizing everything, knowledge,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.260
and making that accessible through the Internet.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.260
Now today, for the first time --

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.260
and the Obama campaign showed us this --

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
we can go from the digital world,

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.260
from the self-organizing power of networks,

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
to the physical one.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.260
This can be, in our case,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.260
we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.260
That means something built in a city.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.260
But tomorrow it can be,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.260
in order to tackle today's pressing challenges --

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.260
think about climate change or CO2 emissions --

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.260
how we can go from the digital world to the physical one.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.260
So the idea that we can actually involve people

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.260
in doing this thing together, collectively.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.260
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.260
in the same way as the real cloud

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.260
is a cloud made of particles.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.260
And those particles are water,

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.260
where our cloud is a cloud of pixels.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.260
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with pixels.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.260
You can move inside, have different types of experiences.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.260
You can actually see from underneath,

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.260
sharing the main moments

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:14.260
for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.260
and really using it as a way to connect with the community.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.260
So both the physical cloud in the sky

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
and something you can go to the top [of],

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.260
like London's new mountaintop.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.260
You can enter inside it.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.260
And a kind of new digital beacon for the night --

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.260
but most importantly,

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.260
a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.260
Thank you.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.260
(Applause)
