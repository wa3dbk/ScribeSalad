00:00:14.063 --> 00:00:16.230
I opened a blind man's head.

00:00:17.363 --> 00:00:21.837
I didn't make him think or reflect --
I cracked his head open, literally.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:24.969
We were walking with him
holding onto my shoulder,

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.833
I miscalculated how much space
there was between us,

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:29.622
and I knocked him into a gate.

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:30.813
(Laughter)

00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:32.806
Five stitches in his forehead.

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:36.936
At that moment, I felt like
the worst teacher in the world.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.068
I really didn't know how to apologize.

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:45.556
Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people
who takes things quite well.

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:48.752
And to this day, he says
that I was the coach

00:00:48.776 --> 00:00:51.220
who left the most important
mark on his career.

00:00:51.244 --> 00:00:53.417
(Laughter)

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.723
The truth is, when I started working
at the institute for the blind,

00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:58.499
I was surprised by a lot of things.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:02.450
A lot of the things they did,
I never imagined they could:

00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:06.396
they swam, did exercise, played cards.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.624
They drank mate, and could pour it

00:01:08.648 --> 00:01:10.712
without burning themselves in the process.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.529
But when I saw them playing soccer --

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:13.965
that was amazing.

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:18.547
They had a dirt field,
rusty goalposts and broken nets.

00:01:19.054 --> 00:01:22.201
The blind who attended the institute
would play their games there,

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:24.800
just like I did at a field near my house.

00:01:24.824 --> 00:01:26.916
But they played without being able to see.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:31.015
The ball made a sound
so they could locate it.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.050
They had a guide
behind the rival team's goal

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.078
to know where to kick the ball.

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:37.980
And they used eye masks.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:40.240
There were guys
who could still see a little,

00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:43.419
and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.

00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:49.176
When I was more at ease with them,
I asked for a mask myself.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.846
I put it on and tried to play.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.567
I had played soccer all my life.

00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:56.318
This is where it got even more amazing:

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:59.162
within two seconds, I didn't know
where I was standing.

00:02:02.126 --> 00:02:05.880
I had studied physical education
because I loved high performance.

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:08.119
I started working
at the institute by chance.

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:10.990
My other job was with the Argentinian
National Rowing Team,

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:12.669
and I felt that was my thing.

00:02:13.262 --> 00:02:15.065
Here, everything was twice as hard.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.540
I'll never forget the first day
I did the warm-up with the team.

00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:21.276
I lined them up in front of me --

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.169
I used to do that with the rowing team --

00:02:24.193 --> 00:02:27.448
and I said, "OK, everyone
bend down," going like this.

00:02:27.472 --> 00:02:29.414
When I looked up, two guys were seated,

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:31.747
three were lying down
and others were squatting.

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.137
(Laughter)

00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:36.523
How could I do here
the same things I was doing there?

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.290
It took me a while.

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:43.778
I started looking for tools
to learn from them,

00:02:43.802 --> 00:02:46.370
from the teachers who worked with them.

00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:51.040
I learned I couldn't explain a play
on a chalkboard like a coach does,

00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:53.844
but I could use a plastic tray
and some bottle caps

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:56.237
so they could follow me by way of touch.

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.932
I also learned they could run on a track

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.979
if I ran with them, holding a rope.

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:05.823
So we started looking for volunteers
to help us run with them.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:08.381
I was enjoying it,

00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:13.056
and finding purpose and meaning
in what we were doing.

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:15.907
It was hard at first,
it was uncomfortable,

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.074
but I decided to overcome the discomfort.

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.520
And there came a time

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:22.308
when it became the most
fascinating job I'd ever had.

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.606
I think that's when I wondered:

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.854
Why couldn't we be
a high-performance team as well?

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.699
Of course, one thing was missing:

00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:34.793
I needed to find out what they wanted,

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:37.396
the real protagonists of this story.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:42.325
Three hours of training,
playing soccer on that field,

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.960
were not going to be enough.

00:03:43.984 --> 00:03:46.119
We would have to train differently.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:49.882
We started to train harder,
and the results were great;

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:51.195
they asked for more.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:53.855
I came to understand
that they, too, wondered

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.787
why they couldn't do high-performance.

00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:01.150
When we felt ready,
we knocked at CENARD's door.

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.914
CENARD is the National Center
for High-Performance Sports

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:05.282
here in Argentina.

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:07.723
It was hard to get them
to hear what we had to say.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.203
But it was considerably more difficult

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:13.993
to get the other athletes training there
to consider us their equals.

00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:16.598
In fact, they would let us use the field

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.835
only when no other teams were using it.

00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:21.311
And we were known as "the blind ones."

00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:24.269
Not everyone knew
exactly what we were doing there.

00:04:25.622 --> 00:04:29.663
The 2006 World Championship
was a turning point in the team's history.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.233
It was held in Buenos Aires
for the first time.

00:04:33.257 --> 00:04:36.056
It was our chance to show everyone

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.003
what we had been doing all that time.

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:40.494
We made it to the finals.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.741
We were growing as a team.

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:45.393
It was us against Brazil in the finals.

00:04:46.406 --> 00:04:48.612
They were the best team in the tournament.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:51.176
They won every game by a landslide.

00:04:52.264 --> 00:04:56.803
Hardly anyone believed
we could win that game.

00:04:57.942 --> 00:04:59.689
Hardly anyone -- except for us.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:02.809
During pre-game meetings,

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:04.476
in the locker room,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.901
during each warm-up,

00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:08.127
it smelled of victory.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:11.531
I swear that smell exists.

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:15.055
I smelled it several times with the team,

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:18.355
but I remember it in particular,
the day before we played that final.

00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:22.440
The Argentine Football Association
had opened their doors to us.

00:05:22.464 --> 00:05:23.930
We were training at AFA,

00:05:23.954 --> 00:05:26.448
where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:27.881
For the first time ever,

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.461
we felt like a true national team.

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:34.671
At 7:30pm, the day before the game,

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:38.523
we were in the lounge discussing strategy,

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:41.762
and a waiter knocks on the door,
interrupting our conversation.

00:05:42.646 --> 00:05:44.330
He suggested we go to church.

00:05:44.354 --> 00:05:46.154
He came to invite us to church.

00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:51.115
I tried to get rid of him,
saying it wasn't a good time,

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.968
that we better leave it for another day.

00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:59.483
He kept insisting, asking me to please
let him take the guys to church,

00:05:59.507 --> 00:06:02.729
because that day, a pastor
who performed miracles would be there.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.792
I was slightly afraid to ask
what type of miracles he meant,

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:10.052
and he replied nonchalantly,

00:06:10.076 --> 00:06:12.276
"Coach, let me take
the team to the church,

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.653
and when we return, I guarantee
that half of them will be able to see."

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.177
(Laughter)

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:22.101
Some of the guys laughed,

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.275
but imagine being a blind person
and someone says that to you.

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:26.684
I didn't know what to say.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:29.352
I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:31.120
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

00:06:31.144 --> 00:06:33.318
because he truly believed
this could happen.

00:06:34.032 --> 00:06:35.994
One of the players saved me,

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:38.640
when he stood up and confidently said,

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.548
"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:43.525
Gonza already told you
it's not the best time to go to church.

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.330
Besides, let me make this clear:

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:49.236
if we go to that church, and I end up
being able to see when we return,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.278
I will beat you so hard
if I can't play tomorrow."

00:06:52.302 --> 00:06:54.006
(Laughter)

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.891
(Applause)

00:07:04.998 --> 00:07:08.942
Juan left, laughing in resignation,

00:07:08.966 --> 00:07:11.012
and we continued with our pregame talk.

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:14.580
That night when I went to sleep,

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:17.925
I began to dream
about the next day's game,

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.628
imagining what could happen,
how we would play.

00:07:20.652 --> 00:07:23.108
And that's when I noticed
that smell of victory

00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:24.346
I mentioned a while ago.

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:26.969
And it's because
at that moment, I thought:

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:31.676
if the other players had the same desire
as Diego going into the game,

00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:34.261
it was impossible for us not to win.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.961
The next day was going to be wonderful.

00:07:38.446 --> 00:07:41.502
We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.747
and we were already eager to play.

00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:50.092
We left AFA, and the bus was full
of flags that people had given to us.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:52.767
We were talking about the game,

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.331
and we could hear people
honking and cheering,

00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:58.665
"Go Murciélagos! Today's the day!
The final challenge!"

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:02.410
The guys asked me, "Do they know us?
Do they know we're playing?"

00:08:03.134 --> 00:08:06.542
Some people followed the bus to CENARD.

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:10.827
We arrived and found an amazing scene.

00:08:11.247 --> 00:08:14.313
In the corridor leading
from the locker room to the game field,

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:16.289
I was walking with Silvio,

00:08:16.313 --> 00:08:19.401
who was holding onto my shoulder,
so I could guide him.

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:21.688
Fortunately, there were
no gates along the way.

00:08:21.712 --> 00:08:22.712
(Laughter)

00:08:22.736 --> 00:08:25.848
When we reached the field,
he asked me about everything.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.808
He didn't want to miss a single detail.

00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:31.651
He said, "Tell me what you see,
tell me who's playing the drums."

00:08:31.675 --> 00:08:35.570
I tried to explain what was happening
with as much detail as possible.

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:40.394
I told him, "The stands are packed,
a lot of people couldn't get in,

00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:43.012
there are blue and white balloons
all over the field,

00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:47.177
they're opening a giant Argentine flag
that covers the entire grandstand."

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:49.298
Suddenly, he cuts me off and says,

00:08:49.322 --> 00:08:53.157
"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"

00:08:54.674 --> 00:08:56.279
That's the city where he lives.

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.456
I started looking into the stands

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.989
and I spotted a little white flag

00:09:01.013 --> 00:09:04.063
with lettering done
in black spray paint, that read:

00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:07.690
"Silvio, your family
and all of San Pedro are here."

00:09:08.227 --> 00:09:10.959
I told him that and he replied,

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:15.032
"That's my mom, tell me where
she is, I want to I wave at her."

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:16.996
I pointed him toward the flag

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.566
and showed him with his arm
where they were sitting,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.574
and he waved his arms in that direction.

00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:24.689
About 20 or 30 people stood up
and gave him an ovation.

00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:26.730
When that happened,

00:09:26.754 --> 00:09:29.079
I saw how his face changed,
how moved he was.

00:09:29.615 --> 00:09:31.461
It was moving for me, too;

00:09:32.106 --> 00:09:34.296
two seconds later,
I had a lump in my throat.

00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:38.604
It was strange -- I felt both
the excitement of what was happening,

00:09:38.628 --> 00:09:41.786
and the anger and the anguish
that he could not see it.

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:48.540
A few days later when I told him
what I had experienced,

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:52.510
he tried to reassure me, saying,

00:09:52.534 --> 00:09:55.111
"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.

00:09:55.135 --> 00:09:57.852
Differently, but I swear to you
that I saw them all."

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:00.644
The game started.

00:10:00.668 --> 00:10:03.506
We could not fail; it was the final.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.955
The audience was quiet, like here,

00:10:05.979 --> 00:10:07.623
because in soccer for the blind,

00:10:07.647 --> 00:10:10.646
the public has to be quiet
so the players can hear the ball.

00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:13.813
They're only allowed to cheer
when the game is over.

00:10:14.265 --> 00:10:16.906
And when there were eight minutes to go,

00:10:17.747 --> 00:10:21.194
the crowd did all the cheering
they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.

00:10:21.218 --> 00:10:24.847
When pigeon-toed Silvio
nailed the ball at an angle,

00:10:24.871 --> 00:10:26.959
they cheered with all their heart,

00:10:26.983 --> 00:10:28.557
in an incredible way.

00:10:30.848 --> 00:10:35.466
Today, if you go to CENARD,
you'll see a huge poster on the door,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.411
with a photo of our team,
Los Murciélagos.

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:42.871
They're a model national team,
everyone in CENARD knows who they are,

00:10:42.895 --> 00:10:45.478
and after having won
two World Championships

00:10:45.502 --> 00:10:46.899
and two Paralympic medals,

00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:49.382
no one doubts they are
high-performance athletes.

00:10:49.406 --> 00:10:56.055
(Applause)

00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:06.001
(Applause ends)

00:11:07.148 --> 00:11:10.836
I was lucky to train
this team for 10 years,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.052
first as a trainer
and later as their coach.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.969
I feel that they've given me much more

00:11:19.993 --> 00:11:21.412
than what I've given them.

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:28.236
Last year, they asked me to coach
another national team, Power Soccer.

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:33.228
It's a national team of young men
who play soccer in wheelchairs.

00:11:33.824 --> 00:11:36.871
They use motorized wheelchairs
that they drive with a joystick,

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.453
because they don't have
enough strength in their arms

00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:40.770
to use conventional chairs.

00:11:40.794 --> 00:11:44.504
They added a bumper to the chair,
a safeguard that protects their feet,

00:11:44.528 --> 00:11:46.647
while allowing them to kick the ball.

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:51.715
It's the first time that, instead
of being the spectators,

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:53.556
they're now the main characters.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:58.790
It's the first time their parents,
friends and siblings can see them play.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.103
For me, it's a new challenge,

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:05.371
with the same discomfort,
insecurity, and fear I had

00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:07.371
when I started working with the blind.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.577
But I approach it all
from a more experienced position.

00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.803
That's why from day one,
I treat them as athletes on the field,

00:12:15.827 --> 00:12:18.437
and off the field, I try
to put myself in their shoes

00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:19.888
and behave without prejudice,

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:23.869
because treating them naturally
feels best to them.

00:12:25.326 --> 00:12:29.714
Both teams play soccer;
something once unthinkable for them.

00:12:30.303 --> 00:12:34.059
They had to adapt the rules to do so.

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:37.653
And both teams broke the same rule --

00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:40.449
the one that said
they couldn't play soccer.

00:12:41.589 --> 00:12:45.813
When you see them play,
you see competition, not disability.

00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:49.722
The problem starts when the game is over,

00:12:49.746 --> 00:12:51.221
and they leave the field.

00:12:51.245 --> 00:12:53.741
Then they step in to play our game,

00:12:53.765 --> 00:12:57.719
in a society whose rules
don't really take them into account

00:12:57.743 --> 00:12:58.908
or care for them.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.340
I learned from sports

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:04.996
that disability greatly depends on
the rules of the game.

00:13:05.512 --> 00:13:09.576
I believe that if we change
some of the rules of our game,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.882
we can make life a little easier for them.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:18.089
We all know there are people
with disabilities; we see them daily.

00:13:18.644 --> 00:13:21.605
But by having no direct contact with them,

00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:25.179
we're not aware of the problems
they face every day,

00:13:25.203 --> 00:13:27.310
like how hard it is for them
to get on a bus,

00:13:27.334 --> 00:13:28.985
find a job,

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:30.162
take the subway

00:13:30.186 --> 00:13:31.336
or cross the street.

00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:35.538
It's true that there is an increasing
social responsibility

00:13:35.562 --> 00:13:39.408
regarding the inclusion
of people with disabilities.

00:13:40.466 --> 00:13:42.959
But I think it's still not enough.

00:13:42.983 --> 00:13:46.022
I think change needs to come
from every one of us.

00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:49.692
First, by leaving behind
our indifference toward the disabled,

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:53.067
and then by respecting the rules
that do take them into account.

00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:54.848
They are few, but they do exist.

00:13:57.158 --> 00:14:00.158
I cracked a blind man's head
open -- El Pulga's head.

00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:04.523
I can assure you these two teams
opened mine as well.

00:14:04.547 --> 00:14:05.984
They taught me that above all,

00:14:06.008 --> 00:14:08.132
you have to get out there
and play every game

00:14:08.156 --> 00:14:10.386
in this beautiful tournament
that we call life.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.566
Thank you.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:17.642
(Applause)
