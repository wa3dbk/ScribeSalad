00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.587
I would like to invite you

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:16.317
to come along on a visit

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.730
to a dark continent.

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.013
It is the continent hidden

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:22.089
under the surface of the earth.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:24.406
It is largely unexplored,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.113
poorly understood,
and the stuff of legends.

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:29.975
But it is made also of dramatic landscapes

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.494
like this huge underground chamber,

00:00:32.518 --> 00:00:37.359
and it is rich with surprising
biological and mineralogical worlds.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.975
Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers
in the last three centuries --

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.833
actually, we know also thanks
to satellite technology, of course --

00:00:46.857 --> 00:00:51.061
we know almost every single square meter
of our planet's surface.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:56.026
However, we know still very little
about what is hidden inside the earth.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.975
Because a cave landscape,
like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.353
the potential of cave exploration --
the geographical dimension --

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.745
is poorly understood and unappreciated.

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:10.804
Because we are creatures
living on the surface,

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:14.975
our perception of the inner
side of the planet

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.963
is in some ways skewed,

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:19.439
as is that of the depth of the oceans

00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:21.970
or of the upper atmosphere.

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:30.052
However, since systematic cave exploration
started about one century ago,

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:34.447
we know actually that caves exist
in every continent of the world.

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:38.515
A single cave system,
like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.523
can be as long
as more than 600 kilometers.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.377
And an abyss like Krubera Voronya,
which is in the Caucasus region,

00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:50.179
actually the deepest cave
explored in the world,

00:01:50.203 --> 00:01:54.524
can go as far as more than 2,000
meters below the surface.

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:58.269
That means a journey of weeks
for a cave explorer.

00:01:59.545 --> 00:02:02.771
Caves form in karstic regions.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:05.975
So karstic regions are areas of the world

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.489
where the infiltrating water
along cracks, fractures,

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:13.473
can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:16.277
forming a drainage system
of tunnels, conduits --

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:18.780
a three-dimensional network, actually.

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:24.683
Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent
of the continents' surface,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:29.831
and we know actually that speleologists
in the last 50 years

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:35.519
have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers
of cave passages around the world,

00:02:35.543 --> 00:02:36.911
which is a big number.

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:41.434
But geologists have estimated
that what is still missing,

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:43.688
to be discovered and mapped,

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:47.263
is something around 10 million kilometers.

00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:50.577
That means that for each meter
of a cave that we already know,

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.134
that we have explored,

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:57.552
there are still some tens of kilometers
of undiscovered passages.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.491
That means that this is really
an endless continent,

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:04.013
and we will never be able
to explore it completely.

00:03:04.597 --> 00:03:08.093
And this estimation is made
without considering other types of caves,

00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:12.556
like, for example, inside glaciers
or even volcanic caves,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.112
which are not karstic,
but are formed by lava flows.

00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:21.792
And if we have a look at other planets
like, for example, Mars,

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:23.666
you will see that this characteristic

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.777
is not so specific of our home planet.

00:03:27.623 --> 00:03:31.975
However, I will show to you now
that we do not need to go to Mars

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.204
to explore alien worlds.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.690
I'm a speleologist, that means
a cave explorer.

00:03:39.714 --> 00:03:43.622
And I started with this passion
when I was really young

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:47.707
in the mountains not far
from my hometown in North Italy,

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.228
in the karstic regions of the Alps
and the Dolomites.

00:03:51.252 --> 00:03:55.093
But soon, the quest for exploration
brought me to the farthest corner

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:57.846
of the planet, searching
for new potential entrances

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.773
of this undiscovered continent.

00:04:00.578 --> 00:04:05.639
And in 2009, I had the opportunity
to visit the tepui table mountains,

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:08.659
which are in the Orinoco
and Amazon basins.

00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:13.235
These massifs enchanted me
from the first time I saw them.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.626
They are surrounded by vertical,
vertiginous rock walls

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.121
with silvery waterfalls
that are lost in the forest.

00:04:20.145 --> 00:04:23.477
They really inspired in me
a sense of wilderness,

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.799
with a soul older than millions
and millions of years.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.391
And this dramatic landscape
inspired among other things

00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:35.975
also Conan Doyle's
"The Lost World" novel in 1912.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:39.303
And they are, really, a lost world.

00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:46.286
Scientists consider those mountains
as islands in time,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.948
being separated
from the surrounding lowlands

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:51.656
since tens of millions of years ago.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.581
They are surrounded
by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,

00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:58.737
resembling a fortress,
impregnable by humans.

00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:01.975
And, in fact, only a few
of these mountains have been climbed

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.835
and explored on their top.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.609
These mountains contain also
a scientific paradox:

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:09.693
They are made by quartz,

00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:12.884
which is a very common mineral
on the earth's crust,

00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:17.286
and the rock made up by quartz
is called quartzite,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.618
and quartzite is one of the hardest
and least soluble minerals on earth.

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:26.033
So we do not expect at all
to find a cave there.

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:30.975
Despite this, in the last 10 years,
speleologists from Italy,

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.804
Slovakia, Czech Republic,
and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,

00:05:34.828 --> 00:05:37.807
have explored several caves in this area.

00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:40.318
So how can it be possible?

00:05:40.342 --> 00:05:44.403
To understand this contradiction,
we have to consider the time factor,

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:47.730
because the history of the tepuis
is extremely long,

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:52.411
starting about 1.6 billion years ago
with the formation of the rock,

00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:58.975
and then evolving with the uplift
of the region 150 million years ago,

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.975
after the disruption
of the Pangaea supercontinent

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.352
and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:06:04.376 --> 00:06:10.686
So you can imagine that the water had tens
or even hundreds of millions of years

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.768
to sculpt the strangest forms
on the tepuis' surfaces,

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:20.806
but also to open the fractures
and form stone cities, rock cities,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.351
fields of towers which are characterized
in the famous landscape of the tepuis.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:27.819
But nobody could have imagined

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:32.579
what was happening inside a mountain
in so long a time frame.

00:06:32.603 --> 00:06:37.080
And so I was focusing in 2010
on one of those massifs,

00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:40.955
the Auyán-tepui, which is very famous
because it hosts Angel Falls,

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.568
which is the highest
waterfall in the world --

00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:47.651
about 979 meters of vertical drop.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:52.561
And I was searching for hints
of the existence of cave systems

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:54.453
through satellite images,

00:06:54.477 --> 00:06:59.167
and finally we identified an area
of collapses of the surface --

00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:01.437
so, big boulders, rock piles --

00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:04.772
and that means that there
was a void below.

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:08.745
It was a clear indication that there
was something inside the mountain.

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:13.615
So we did several attempts
to reach this area,

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.401
by land and with a helicopter,

00:07:15.425 --> 00:07:18.975
but it was really difficult
because -- you have to imagine

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:23.378
that these mountains are covered
by clouds most of the year, by fog.

00:07:23.402 --> 00:07:24.775
There are strong winds,

00:07:24.799 --> 00:07:29.381
and there are almost 4,000 millimeters
of rainfall per year,

00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:32.667
so it's really, really difficult
to find good conditions.

00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:37.474
And only in 2013 we finally
landed on the spot

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:39.992
and we started
the exploration of the cave.

00:07:40.723 --> 00:07:42.640
The cave is huge.

00:07:42.664 --> 00:07:46.491
It's a huge network under the surface
of the tepui plateau,

00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:50.209
and in only ten days of expedition,

00:07:50.233 --> 00:07:54.356
we explored more than 20 kilometers
of cave passages.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.777
And it's a huge network
of underground rivers,

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:04.975
channels, big rooms,
extremely deep shafts.

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:08.023
So it's really an incredible place.

00:08:08.047 --> 00:08:10.588
And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.

00:08:10.612 --> 00:08:16.873
That means, in the Pemón indigenous
language, "The House of the Gods."

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:20.679
You have to imagine that indigenous people
have never been there.

00:08:20.703 --> 00:08:24.208
It was impossible for them
to reach this area.

00:08:24.232 --> 00:08:26.438
However, there were legends
about the existence

00:08:26.462 --> 00:08:28.489
of a cave in the mountain.

00:08:28.513 --> 00:08:30.283
So when we started the exploration,

00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:32.537
we had to explore with a great respect,

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:36.122
both because of the religious beliefs
of the indigenous people,

00:08:36.146 --> 00:08:38.511
but also because
it was really a sacred place,

00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:41.870
because no human had entered there before.

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:43.697
So we had to use special protocols

00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:46.510
to not contaminate the environment
with our presence,

00:08:46.534 --> 00:08:48.709
and we tried also to share
with the community,

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:51.406
with the indigenous community,
our discoveries.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.986
And the caves represent, really,
a snapshot of the past.

00:08:56.503 --> 00:08:59.215
The time needed for their formation

00:08:59.239 --> 00:09:04.163
could be as long as 50 or even
100 million years,

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:09.088
which makes them possibly the oldest caves
that we can explore on earth.

00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:16.648
What you can find there
is really evidence of a lost world.

00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:19.288
When you enter a quartzite cave,

00:09:19.312 --> 00:09:22.760
you have to completely forget
what you know about caves --

00:09:22.784 --> 00:09:25.781
classic limestone caves
or the touristic caves

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:28.162
that you can visit
in several places in the world.

00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:31.111
Because what seems
a simple stalactite here

00:09:31.135 --> 00:09:36.220
is not made by calcium carbonate,
but is made by opal,

00:09:36.244 --> 00:09:41.828
and one of those stalactites can require
tens of millions of years to be formed.

00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:46.762
But you can find even stranger forms,
like these mushrooms of silica

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:48.860
growing on a boulder.

00:09:48.884 --> 00:09:52.670
And you can imagine our talks
when we were exploring the cave.

00:09:52.694 --> 00:09:57.687
We were the first entering
and discovering those unknown things,

00:09:57.711 --> 00:10:00.549
things like those monster eggs.

00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:04.969
And we were a bit scared
because it was all a discovery,

00:10:04.993 --> 00:10:07.076
and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.604
We didn't find a dinosaur.

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:10.225
(Laughter)

00:10:10.249 --> 00:10:13.546
Anyway, actually, we know
that this kind of formation,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.103
after several studies,

00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:19.352
we know that these kinds of formations
are living organisms.

00:10:19.376 --> 00:10:24.810
They are bacterial colonies using silica
to build mineral structures

00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:26.764
resembling stromatolites.

00:10:26.788 --> 00:10:31.309
Stromatolites are some of the oldest
forms of life that we can find on earth.

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.136
And here in the tepuis,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.843
the interesting thing is that these
bacteria colonies have evolved

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:42.096
in complete isolation
from the external surface,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.744
and without being in contact with humans.

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:47.365
They have never been
in contact with humans.

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:50.456
So the implications
for science are enormous,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.482
because here you could find,
for example, microbes

00:10:54.506 --> 00:10:59.458
that could be useful to resolve
diseases in medicine,

00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:03.418
or you could find even a new kind
of material with unknown properties.

00:11:03.442 --> 00:11:07.501
And, in fact, we discovered in the cave
a new mineral structure for science,

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:10.532
which is rossiantonite,
a phosphate-sulfate.

00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:16.320
So whatever you find in the cave,
even a small cricket,

00:11:16.344 --> 00:11:20.312
has evolved in the dark
in complete isolation.

00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:24.589
And, really, everything that you can feel
in the cave are real connections

00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:27.653
between the biological
and the mineralogical world.

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:34.360
So as we explore this dark continent

00:11:34.384 --> 00:11:40.788
and discover its mineralogical
and biological diversity and uniqueness,

00:11:40.812 --> 00:11:45.181
we will find probably clues
about the origin of life on our planet

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:48.182
and on the relationship
and evolution of life

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:51.192
in relationship with the mineral world.

00:11:51.216 --> 00:11:55.158
What seems only a dark, empty environment

00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:57.975
could be in reality a chest of wonders

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:00.479
full of useful information.

00:12:02.102 --> 00:12:05.975
With a team of Italian, Venezuelan
and Brazilian speleologists,

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:09.190
which is called La Venta Teraphosa,

00:12:09.214 --> 00:12:11.282
we will be back soon to Latin America,

00:12:11.306 --> 00:12:16.754
because we want to explore other tepuis
in the farthest areas of the Amazon.

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.798
There are still very unknown mountains,

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:24.516
like Marahuaca, which is almost
3,000 meters high above sea level,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.639
or Aracà, which is in the upper region
of Rio Negro in Brazil.

00:12:28.663 --> 00:12:33.582
And we suppose that we could find there
even bigger cave systems,

00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:38.294
and each one with its own
undiscovered world.

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:39.810
Thank you.

00:12:39.834 --> 00:12:45.288
(Applause)

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:49.049
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.
Give me that to start so we don't forget.

00:12:49.073 --> 00:12:52.911
Francesco, you said we don't need
to go to Mars to find alien life,

00:12:52.935 --> 00:12:55.860
and indeed, last time we spoke,
you were in Sardinia

00:12:55.884 --> 00:12:58.127
and you were training European astronauts.

00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:01.625
So what do you, a speleologist,
tell and teach to the astronauts?

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:04.432
Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --
it's a program of training

00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:09.357
for not only European, but also NASA,
Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.

00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:12.909
So they stay in a cave
for about one week in isolation.

00:13:12.933 --> 00:13:16.813
They have to work together
in a real, real dangerous environment,

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:20.647
and it's a real alien environment for them
because it's unusual.

00:13:20.671 --> 00:13:24.975
It's always dark. They have to do science.
They have a lot of tasks.

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:27.531
And it's very similar to a journey to Mars

00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:29.227
or the International Space Station.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:30.510
BG: In principle.
FS: Yes.

00:13:30.534 --> 00:13:32.611
BG: I want to go back
to one of the pictures

00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.468
that was in your slide show,

00:13:34.492 --> 00:13:36.881
and it's just representative
of the other photos --

00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:39.203
Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?

00:13:39.227 --> 00:13:40.385
Audience: Yeah!

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:44.145
(Applause)

00:13:44.169 --> 00:13:47.295
FS: I have to thank the photographers
from the team La Venta,

00:13:47.319 --> 00:13:51.092
because all of those photos
are from the photographers.

00:13:51.116 --> 00:13:54.818
BG: You bring, actually, photographers
with you in the expedition.

00:13:54.842 --> 00:13:57.809
They're professionals,
they're speleologists and photographers.

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:02.733
But when I look at these pictures,
I wonder: there is zero light down there,

00:14:02.757 --> 00:14:05.540
and yet they look incredibly well-exposed.

00:14:05.564 --> 00:14:07.052
How do you take these pictures?

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:10.127
How do your colleagues,
the photographers, take these pictures?

00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:12.642
FS: Yeah. They are working
in a darkroom, basically,

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.785
so you can open the shutter of the camera

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.227
and use the lights
to paint the environment.

00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:18.506
BG: So you're basically --

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.265
FS: Yes. You can even keep
the shutter open for one minute

00:14:21.289 --> 00:14:22.813
and then paint the environment.

00:14:22.837 --> 00:14:25.541
The final result is what
you want to achieve.

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:28.638
BG: You spray the environment with light
and that's what you get.

00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:31.104
Maybe we can try this at home
someday, I don't know.

00:14:31.128 --> 00:14:32.132
(Laughter)

00:14:32.156 --> 00:14:33.747
BG: Francesco, grazie.
FS: Grazie.

00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:36.999
(Applause)
