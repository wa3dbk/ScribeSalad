00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:14.445
I'm going to be talking about designing humor,

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.419
which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:20.127
to some of the discussions about constraints,

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:22.885
and how in certain contexts, humor is right,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:24.576
and in other contexts it's wrong.

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:27.352
Now, I'm from New York,

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:30.938
so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:34.141
Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,

00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.430
75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.413
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:45.129
except this woman.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:54.866
(Video) Woman: (Laughs)

00:01:02.378 --> 00:01:03.778
Bob Mankoff: That's my first wife.

00:01:03.778 --> 00:01:06.053
(Laughter)

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:08.545
That part of the relationship went fine.

00:01:08.545 --> 00:01:12.110
(Laughter)

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.632
Now let's look at this cartoon.

00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:17.208
One of the things I'm pointing out is that

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:19.512
cartoons appear within the context

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.225
of The New Yorker magazine,

00:01:21.225 --> 00:01:23.166
that lovely Caslon type, and it seems

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.640
like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.711
It's making a little bit fun of getting older,

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.063
and, you know, people might like it.

00:01:30.063 --> 00:01:33.299
But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.745
You couldn't satisfy this guy.

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.832
"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.492
It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:43.965
but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:47.183
(Laughter)

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.693
The New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:53.301
very easy for people to get their nose out of joint.

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:56.235
And one of the things that you realize

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:58.702
is it's an unusual environment.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:00.845
Here I'm one person talking to you.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:04.543
You're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.

00:02:04.543 --> 00:02:08.824
In The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.316
and when you actually look at that,

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:13.828
and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,

00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:17.144
and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:18.727
is really interesting.

00:02:18.727 --> 00:02:20.365
Let's look at this cartoon.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:22.700
"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.724
(Laughter)

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.735
Indeed, it is discouraging.

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:29.537
Now, you would think, well, look,

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.206
most of you laughed at that.

00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:32.627
Right? You thought it was funny.

00:02:32.627 --> 00:02:34.309
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon,

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:37.693
but let's look what online survey I did.

00:02:37.693 --> 00:02:39.810
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.173
A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:45.484
But look at the individual responses.

00:02:45.484 --> 00:02:47.787
"I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:51.314
(Laughter)

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:54.413
"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."

00:02:54.413 --> 00:02:56.302
This person rated it a two.

00:02:56.302 --> 00:03:00.684
"I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons."

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:05.810
To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.567
Other people thought it was funny.

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:10.636
That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:14.814
when you don't have the contagion of humor.

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:16.531
Humor is a type of entertainment.

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:20.338
All entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:22.458
something that might happen wrong,

00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:24.927
and yet we like it when there's protection.

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:27.662
That's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:31.812
The bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:33.393
That's a bad zoo.

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:35.916
(Laughter)

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:39.938
It's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.

00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:42.093
But this is a worse one.

00:03:42.093 --> 00:03:45.898
(Laughter)

00:03:45.898 --> 00:03:50.017
So in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,

00:03:50.017 --> 00:03:52.866
you have to see, where is that tiger going to be?

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:54.228
Where is the danger going to exist?

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:56.447
How are you going to manage it?

00:03:56.447 --> 00:04:00.844
My job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.

00:04:00.844 --> 00:04:05.063
But The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:06.580
and we have 1,000 cartoons.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.456
Of course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.

00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:12.619
Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.635
if we removed the articles.

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:18.367
(Laughter)

00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:23.324
But I feel that would be a huge loss,

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:27.097
one I could live with, but still huge.

00:04:27.097 --> 00:04:30.013
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.

00:04:30.013 --> 00:04:32.011
The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.567
does 10 or 15 ideas every week.

00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:37.633
But they mostly are going to be rejected.

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.677
That's the nature of any creative activity.

00:04:40.677 --> 00:04:44.141
Many of them fade away. Some of them stay.

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.559
Matt Diffee is one of them.

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.577
Here's one of his cartoons.

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:53.152
(Laughter)

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:56.046
Drew Dernavich. "Accounting night at the improv."

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.150
"Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.909
to shout out some random numbers."

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.685
Paul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:12.458
(Laughter)

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:14.340
Now I know all about rejection,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.587
because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:22.019
and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:27.093
from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,

00:05:27.093 --> 00:05:31.689
and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:36.041
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --

00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.036
[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] —

00:05:37.036 --> 00:05:38.610
magically changed to this.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.048
[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:44.859
(Laughter)

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.128
Now of course that's not what happened,

00:05:47.128 --> 00:05:51.745
but that's the emotional truth.

00:05:51.745 --> 00:05:54.168
And of course, that is not New Yorker humor.

00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:55.957
What is New Yorker humor?

00:05:55.957 --> 00:06:00.633
Well, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.530
Finally, in 1980, I received the revered

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.724
New Yorker contract,

00:06:05.724 --> 00:06:09.759
which I blurred out parts because it's none of your business.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.269
From 1980. "Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:15.722
there of -- " blah blah blah blah -- blur --

00:06:15.722 --> 00:06:19.150
"for any idea drawings."

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.176
With respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract

00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:24.255
is the word "cartoon" mentioned.

00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:29.704
The word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.

00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:33.129
So what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:36.414
that requires you to think.

00:06:36.414 --> 00:06:39.199
Now that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.196
on the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part

00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:44.306
to make it into a cartoon.

00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:50.071
(Laughter)

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:55.214
Here are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:07:01.359
"There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:03.327
This is What Lemmings Believe.

00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:09.616
(Laughter)

00:07:09.616 --> 00:07:12.541
The New Yorker and I, when we made comments,

00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:17.052
the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.

00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:19.340
What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.692
No. It's about us.

00:07:21.692 --> 00:07:24.572
You know, it's my view basically about religion,

00:07:24.572 --> 00:07:29.259
that the real conflict and all the fights between religion

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:32.140
is who has the best imaginary friend.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.271
(Laughter)

00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:39.263
And this is my most well-known cartoon.

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:43.015
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:07:43.015 --> 00:07:45.582
It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.

00:07:45.582 --> 00:07:48.344
It's even on thongs,

00:07:48.344 --> 00:07:54.971
but compressed to "How about never — is never good for you?"

00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:58.370
Now these look like very different forms of humor

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.764
but actually they bear a great similarity.

00:08:00.764 --> 00:08:05.187
In each instance, our expectations are defied.

00:08:05.187 --> 00:08:08.903
In each instance, the narrative gets switched.

00:08:08.903 --> 00:08:11.157
There's an incongruity and a contrast.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:14.406
In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:08:14.406 --> 00:08:16.886
what you have is the syntax of politeness

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:19.147
and the message of being rude.

00:08:19.147 --> 00:08:22.416
That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy

00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:26.195
where we mash up these two things which don't go together

00:08:26.195 --> 00:08:28.976
and temporarily in our minds exist.

00:08:28.976 --> 00:08:31.496
He is both being polite and rude.

00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:34.767
In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:36.748
and the vulgarity of the language.

00:08:36.748 --> 00:08:38.773
Basically, that's the way humor works.

00:08:38.773 --> 00:08:41.295
So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.

00:08:41.295 --> 00:08:44.837
Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:47.485
Nobody is much interested, and the frog dies.

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:52.208
Well, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.013
But really, it makes me —

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:56.085
Let's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:58.017
The Laughing Audience.

00:08:58.017 --> 00:08:59.798
There are the people, fops up there,

00:08:59.798 --> 00:09:02.923
but everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing

00:09:02.923 --> 00:09:05.414
except one guy.

00:09:05.414 --> 00:09:09.954
This guy. Who is he? He's the critic.

00:09:09.954 --> 00:09:12.396
He's the critic of humor,

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:15.564
and really I'm forced to be in that position,

00:09:15.564 --> 00:09:18.860
when I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.977
that I will become this guy.

00:09:23.977 --> 00:09:26.870
Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.594
how they imagine if we really exaggerated that.

00:09:30.594 --> 00:09:33.620
(Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.148
Ehhh.

00:09:36.148 --> 00:09:45.422
Oooh. Hmm. Too funny.

00:09:45.422 --> 00:09:49.360
Normally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.059
I'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.

00:09:52.059 --> 00:09:55.720
No. Nah. No.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.717
Overdrawn. Underdrawn.

00:09:58.717 --> 00:10:01.387
Drawn just right, still not funny enough.

00:10:01.387 --> 00:10:04.653
No. No.

00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:08.018
For God's sake no, a thousand times no.

00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:11.292
(Music)

00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:17.277
No. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later]

00:10:17.277 --> 00:10:21.043
Hey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?

00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:23.186
Office worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.

00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:26.111
Office worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.

00:10:26.111 --> 00:10:28.054
Office worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.

00:10:28.054 --> 00:10:30.256
Office worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.

00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:31.696
Eh, no.

00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:33.111
Office worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.

00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:34.048
Office worker: BLT?BM: No.

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:36.668
Office worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No.

00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.189
Office worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.

00:10:39.189 --> 00:10:41.770
(Music)

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.714
No. No.

00:10:43.714 --> 00:10:46.944
Definitely no. [Several hours after lunch]

00:10:46.944 --> 00:10:55.710
(Siren)

00:11:08.695 --> 00:11:11.192
No. Get out of here.

00:11:11.192 --> 00:11:12.609
(Laughter)

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:16.086
That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.

00:11:16.086 --> 00:11:19.352
Now, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,

00:11:19.352 --> 00:11:22.456
so many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."

00:11:22.456 --> 00:11:26.834
"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.301
And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here

00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:33.124
who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.

00:11:33.124 --> 00:11:35.612
See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:38.889
It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.

00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:43.311
So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.

00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:46.022
"I'm thinking about having a child."

00:11:46.022 --> 00:11:51.310
(Laughter)

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.084
There you have an interesting -- the guilty laugh,

00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:58.342
the laugh against your better judgment.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.393
(Laughter)

00:12:01.393 --> 00:12:04.555
"Ass-head. Please help."

00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:06.838
(Laughter)

00:12:06.838 --> 00:12:10.502
Now, in fact, within a context of this book,

00:12:10.502 --> 00:12:13.544
which says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see

00:12:13.544 --> 00:12:16.267
in The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.

00:12:16.267 --> 00:12:17.872
I'm going to explain why.

00:12:17.872 --> 00:12:19.584
There's a concept about humor about it being

00:12:19.584 --> 00:12:21.917
a benign violation.

00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:23.894
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think

00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:27.435
it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.

00:12:27.435 --> 00:12:30.371
If we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."

00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:34.036
And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?

00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:39.416
And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:12:39.416 --> 00:12:41.574
It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.

00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:44.478
Within that context, we feel it's okay.

00:12:44.478 --> 00:12:47.690
So within this context, "Asshead. Please help"

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.734
is a benign violation.

00:12:49.734 --> 00:12:54.063
Within the context of The New Yorker magazine ...

00:12:54.063 --> 00:12:57.606
"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response

00:12:57.606 --> 00:13:01.516
help treat cancer?" Oh, goodness.

00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:05.278
You're reading about this smart stuff,

00:13:05.278 --> 00:13:09.299
this intelligent dissection of the immune system.

00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:13.032
You glance over at this, and it says,

00:13:13.032 --> 00:13:18.194
"Asshead. Please help"? God.

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:22.794
So there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.

00:13:22.794 --> 00:13:25.917
There is no such thing as funny in and of itself.

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:29.768
Everything will be within the context and our expectations.

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:33.206
One way to look at it is this.

00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:37.347
It's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,

00:13:37.347 --> 00:13:39.195
a theory about motivation and the mood we're in

00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:42.309
and how the mood we're in determines the things we like

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.009
or dislike.

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:48.307
When we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.

00:13:48.307 --> 00:13:51.616
We want high arousal. We feel excited then.

00:13:51.616 --> 00:13:54.220
If we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.801
"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.

00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.157
You want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.

00:14:02.157 --> 00:14:06.647
You want to be transgressed.

00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:11.017
It's like this, like an amusement park.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:20.180
Voice: Here we go. (Screams)

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:24.150
He laughs. He is both in danger and safe,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.298
incredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.

00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:30.523
If you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,

00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:32.789
they will laugh at very, very little.

00:14:32.789 --> 00:14:35.074
This is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection."

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:39.533
"Too snug?"

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:41.736
That's a cartoon about terrorism.

00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:45.092
The New Yorker occupies a very different space.

00:14:45.092 --> 00:14:48.817
It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,

00:14:48.817 --> 00:14:52.309
and in that space, the cartoons are different.

00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:54.678
Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did

00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:59.276
right after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.

00:14:59.276 --> 00:15:00.705
How would The New Yorker attack it?

00:15:00.705 --> 00:15:05.258
It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?"

00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:07.482
Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because

00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:11.442
actually I thought maybe people would be offended.

00:15:11.442 --> 00:15:15.088
The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened

00:15:15.088 --> 00:15:19.120
after the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.909
the suicide bomber is all in little pieces,

00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:24.009
and he's saying to the suicide bomber,

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:27.280
"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.382
(Laughter)

00:15:31.382 --> 00:15:34.806
Better left undrawn.

00:15:34.806 --> 00:15:37.454
The first week we did no cartoons.

00:15:37.454 --> 00:15:40.430
That was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.028
It's not always appropriate every time.

00:15:43.028 --> 00:15:46.676
But the next week, this was the first cartoon.

00:15:46.676 --> 00:15:51.286
"I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."

00:15:51.286 --> 00:15:54.305
It basically was about, if we were alive,

00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:56.102
we were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.

00:15:56.102 --> 00:15:58.373
We were going to exist. Here's another one.

00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:03.708
"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."

00:16:03.708 --> 00:16:07.266
These cartoons are not about them. They're about us.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:09.590
The humor reflects back on us.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.425
The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,

00:16:13.425 --> 00:16:17.050
is a friend makes fun of an enemy.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:19.183
It's called dispositional humor.

00:16:19.183 --> 00:16:22.652
It's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.

00:16:22.652 --> 00:16:25.062
Here's another cartoon.

00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:28.694
"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."

00:16:28.694 --> 00:16:33.283
(Laughter)

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:42.215
Humor does need a target.

00:16:42.215 --> 00:16:46.391
But interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.

00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:48.951
The target is the readership and the people who do it.

00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:51.119
The humor is self-reflective

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:53.972
and makes us think about our assumptions.

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:57.507
Look at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary.

00:16:57.507 --> 00:17:00.161
"Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,

00:17:00.161 --> 00:17:03.127
three years your junior, your age on the dot,

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:05.695
exactly your age."

00:17:05.695 --> 00:17:09.119
That is a deeply profound cartoon.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:13.590
And so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:17.297
make cartoons say something besides funny

00:17:17.297 --> 00:17:19.544
and something about us. Here's another one.

00:17:19.544 --> 00:17:21.752
"I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,

00:17:21.752 --> 00:17:25.075
Then it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people."

00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:30.722
(Laughter)

00:17:30.722 --> 00:17:33.748
"Excuse me — I think there's something wrong with this

00:17:33.763 --> 00:17:39.587
in a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint."

00:17:39.587 --> 00:17:43.563
So it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:47.828
our foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.

00:17:47.828 --> 00:17:50.334
The New Yorker demands

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.067
some cognitive work on your part,

00:17:53.067 --> 00:17:55.422
and what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,

00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:58.337
who wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship

00:17:58.337 --> 00:18:01.134
between humor, art and science,

00:18:01.134 --> 00:18:03.214
is what's called bisociation.

00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:06.810
You have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.982
and you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.

00:18:09.982 --> 00:18:12.464
If the different frames of reference don't come together

00:18:12.464 --> 00:18:14.450
in about .5 seconds, it's not funny,

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.384
but I think they will for you here.

00:18:16.384 --> 00:18:18.458
Different frames of reference.

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:21.286
"You slept with her, didn't you?"

00:18:21.286 --> 00:18:26.574
(Laughter)

00:18:26.574 --> 00:18:28.915
"Lassie! Get help!!"

00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:32.883
(Laughter)

00:18:32.883 --> 00:18:35.575
It's called French Army Knife.

00:18:35.575 --> 00:18:42.003
(Laughter)

00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:44.699
And this is Einstein in bed. "To you it was fast."

00:18:44.699 --> 00:18:51.930
(Laughter)

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.154
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling.

00:18:55.154 --> 00:18:59.218
Like, this cartoon would puzzle many people.

00:18:59.218 --> 00:19:03.445
How many people know what this cartoon means?

00:19:03.445 --> 00:19:07.949
The dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:13.655
This is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.

00:19:13.655 --> 00:19:16.196
That's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year

00:19:16.196 --> 00:19:19.266
called "I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test."

00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:21.345
(Laughter)

00:19:21.345 --> 00:19:23.283
The other thing The New Yorker plays around with

00:19:23.283 --> 00:19:25.993
is incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,

00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:27.581
is sort of the basis of humor.

00:19:27.581 --> 00:19:30.988
Something that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.

00:19:30.988 --> 00:19:34.581
But the way incongruity works is, observational humor

00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:37.003
is humor within the realm of reality.

00:19:37.003 --> 00:19:42.481
"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?

00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:45.474
That could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.

00:19:45.474 --> 00:19:47.670
Here, cowboy to a cow:

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.027
"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."

00:19:52.027 --> 00:19:55.703
We understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.

00:19:55.703 --> 00:19:59.201
Here, in the nonsense range:

00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:04.256
"Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"

00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:08.599
Now that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:11.396
In general, people who enjoy more nonsense,

00:20:11.396 --> 00:20:13.366
enjoy more abstract art,

00:20:13.366 --> 00:20:16.591
they tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.

00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:20.256
But for us, and for me, helping design the humor,

00:20:20.256 --> 00:20:22.821
it doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:27.236
It's sort of a smorgasbord that's made all interesting.

00:20:27.236 --> 00:20:31.846
So I want to sum all this up with a caption to a cartoon,

00:20:31.846 --> 00:20:34.606
and I think this sums up the whole thing, really,

00:20:34.606 --> 00:20:36.972
about The New Yorker cartoons.

00:20:36.972 --> 00:20:39.844
"It sort of makes you stop and think, doesn't it."

00:20:39.844 --> 00:20:43.277
(Laughter)

00:20:43.277 --> 00:20:45.559
And now, when you look at New Yorker cartoons,

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:47.739
I'd like you to stop and think a little bit more about them.

00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:48.952
Thank you.

00:20:48.952 --> 00:20:52.589
(Applause)

00:20:52.589 --> 00:20:54.848
Thank you. (Applause)
