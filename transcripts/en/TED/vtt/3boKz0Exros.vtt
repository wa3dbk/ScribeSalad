00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:15.435
It's August 5, 2010.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:20.281
A massive collapse at the San José
Copper Mine in Northern Chile

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:26.486
has left 33 men trapped half a mile --
that's two Empire State Buildings --

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.341
below some of the hardest
rock in the world.

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:35.212
They will find their way to a small refuge
designed for this purpose,

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:39.316
where they will find intense heat, filth

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.301
and about enough food
for two men for 10 days.

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:46.904
Aboveground, it doesn't take long

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:50.083
for the experts to figure out
that there is no solution.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.238
No drilling technology in the industry
is capable of getting through rock

00:00:56.262 --> 00:00:58.695
that hard and that deep

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.054
fast enough to save their lives.

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:05.663
It's not exactly clear
where the refuge is.

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.245
It's not even clear
if the miners are alive.

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:12.605
And it's not even clear who's in charge.

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:18.554
Yet, within 70 days, all 33 of these men
will be brought to the surface alive.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.700
This remarkable story is a case study

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:24.083
in the power of teaming.

00:01:24.678 --> 00:01:26.017
So what's "teaming"?

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:28.248
Teaming is teamwork on the fly.

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:30.724
It's coordinating
and collaborating with people

00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:32.713
across boundaries of all kinds --

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:37.421
expertise, distance,
time zone, you name it --

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.185
to get work done.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.784
Think of your favorite sports team,
because this is different.

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:47.793
Sports teams work together: that magic,
those game-saving plays.

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:51.900
Now, sports teams win
because they practice.

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:56.389
But you can only practice
if you have the same members over time.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:58.529
And so you can think of teaming ...

00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:01.843
Sports teams embody
the definition of a team,

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:03.236
the formal definition.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.261
It's a stable, bounded,
reasonably small group of people

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:09.967
who are interdependent
in achieving a shared outcome.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.213
You can think of teaming
as a kind of pickup game in the park,

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:17.161
in contrast to the formal,
well-practiced team.

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:19.713
Now, which one is going
to win in a playoff?

00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:21.333
The answer is obvious.

00:02:21.828 --> 00:02:23.692
So why do I study teaming?

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.972
It's because it's the way
more and more of us have to work today.

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:33.295
With 24/7 global fast-paced operations,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.031
crazy shifting schedules

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.771
and ever-narrower expertise,

00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:42.025
more and more of us have to work
with different people all the time

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.412
to get our work done.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:46.070
We don't have the luxury of stable teams.

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:50.224
Now, when you can have that luxury,
by all means do it.

00:02:50.248 --> 00:02:52.992
But increasingly for a lot
of the work we do today,

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.474
we don't have that option.

00:02:54.498 --> 00:02:57.350
One place where this is true is hospitals.

00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:00.935
This is where I've done
a lot of my research over the years.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.801
So it turns out hospitals
have to be open 24/7.

00:03:06.524 --> 00:03:09.964
And patients -- well,
they're all different.

00:03:09.988 --> 00:03:12.745
They're all different
in complicated and unique ways.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.372
The average hospitalized patient is seen
by 60 or so different caregivers

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:19.848
throughout his stay.

00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:23.238
They come from different shifts,
different specialties,

00:03:23.262 --> 00:03:27.203
different areas of expertise,

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.720
and they may not even
know each other's name.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:33.299
But they have to coordinate in order
for the patient to get great care.

00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:36.050
And when they don't,
the results can be tragic.

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:40.677
Of course, in teaming,
the stakes aren't always life and death.

00:03:40.701 --> 00:03:44.741
Consider what it takes
to create an animated film,

00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:46.460
an award-winning animated film.

00:03:46.484 --> 00:03:49.640
I had the good fortune
to go to Disney Animation

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:54.602
and study over 900 scientists, artists,

00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:57.013
storytellers, computer scientists

00:03:57.037 --> 00:04:01.000
as they teamed up in constantly
changing configurations

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.342
to create amazing outcomes like "Frozen."

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:08.805
They just work together,
and never the same group twice,

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.151
not knowing what's going to happen next.

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:14.666
Now, taking care of patients
in the emergency room

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.128
and designing an animated film

00:04:17.152 --> 00:04:19.440
are obviously very different work.

00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:23.200
Yet underneath the differences,
they have a lot in common.

00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:26.623
You have to get different expertise
at different times,

00:04:26.647 --> 00:04:30.172
you don't have fixed roles,
you don't have fixed deliverables,

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:33.734
you're going to be doing a lot of things
that have never been done before,

00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:36.220
and you can't do it in a stable team.

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:40.363
Now, this way of working isn't easy,

00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:43.939
but as I said, it's more and more
the way many of us have to work,

00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:45.360
so we have to understand it.

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.994
And I would argue
that it's especially needed

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:51.124
for work that's complex and unpredictable

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:53.149
and for solving big problems.

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:56.972
Paul Polman, the Unilever CEO,
put this really well

00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:01.120
when he said, "The issues we face today
are so big and so challenging,

00:05:01.144 --> 00:05:03.516
it becomes quite clear
we can't do it alone,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.531
and so there is a certain humility
in knowing you have to invite people in."

00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:14.110
Issues like food or water scarcity
cannot be done by individuals,

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:15.732
even by single companies,

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:17.332
even by single sectors.

00:05:17.356 --> 00:05:22.496
So we're reaching out
to team across big teaming,

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.019
grand-scale teaming.

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:26.804
Take the quest for smart cities.

00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:29.927
Maybe you've seen some of the rhetoric:

00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:33.525
mixed-use designs,
zero net energy buildings,

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:35.834
smart mobility,

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:38.353
green, livable, wonderful cities.

00:05:39.162 --> 00:05:42.355
We have the vocabulary,
we have the visions,

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.268
not to mention the need.

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:45.788
We have the technology.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.299
Two megatrends --

00:05:47.323 --> 00:05:50.230
urbanization, we're fast
becoming a more urban planet,

00:05:50.254 --> 00:05:51.554
and climate change --

00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:54.440
have been increasingly pointing to cities

00:05:54.464 --> 00:05:56.718
as a crucial target for innovation.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.376
And now around the world
in various locations,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.388
people have been teaming up

00:06:01.412 --> 00:06:05.623
to design and try to create
green, livable, smart cities.

00:06:06.154 --> 00:06:08.654
It's a massive innovation challenge.

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:11.058
To understand it better,

00:06:11.082 --> 00:06:16.590
I studied a start-up --
a smart-city software start-up --

00:06:16.614 --> 00:06:19.268
as it teamed up
with a real estate developer,

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:21.271
some civil engineers,

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:22.752
a mayor,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.539
an architect, some builders,
some tech companies.

00:06:27.563 --> 00:06:31.837
Their goal was to build
a demo smart city from scratch.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.986
OK. Five years into the project,
not a whole lot had happened.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.359
Six years, still no ground broken.

00:06:41.383 --> 00:06:44.698
It seemed that teaming
across industry boundaries

00:06:44.722 --> 00:06:47.035
was really, really hard.

00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:49.427
OK, so ...

00:06:50.362 --> 00:06:53.838
We had inadvertently discovered

00:06:53.862 --> 00:06:57.366
what I call "professional culture clash"
with this project.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.449
You know, software engineers
and real estate developers

00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:03.066
think differently --

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.848
really differently:

00:07:04.872 --> 00:07:09.213
different values, different time frames --
time frames is a big one --

00:07:09.237 --> 00:07:12.394
and different jargon, different language.

00:07:12.418 --> 00:07:15.085
And so they don't always see eye to eye.

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:19.104
I think this is a bigger problem
than most of us realize.

00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:23.732
In fact, I think
professional culture clash

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:28.256
is a major barrier to building
the future that we aspire to build.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.061
And so it becomes a problem
that we have to understand,

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:35.017
a problem that we have
to figure out how to crack.

00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:39.088
So how do you make sure teaming goes well,
especially big teaming?

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.093
This is the question I've been trying
to solve for a number of years

00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:44.572
in many different workplaces

00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:45.877
with my research.

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:50.446
Now, to begin to get just a glimpse
of the answer to this question,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.782
let's go back to Chile.

00:07:52.403 --> 00:07:57.469
In Chile, we witnessed 10 weeks of teaming

00:07:57.493 --> 00:07:59.654
by hundreds of individuals

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:02.236
from different professions,
different companies,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.721
different sectors, even different nations.

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:08.128
And as this process unfolded,

00:08:08.152 --> 00:08:12.762
they had lots of ideas,
they tried many things,

00:08:12.786 --> 00:08:15.036
they experimented, they failed,

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.558
they experienced
devastating daily failure,

00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:20.305
but they picked up, persevered,

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.413
and went on forward.

00:08:22.437 --> 00:08:27.066
And really, what we witnessed there

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.724
was they were able to be humble

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:33.061
in the face of the very
real challenge ahead,

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:35.360
curious -- all of these
diverse individuals,

00:08:35.384 --> 00:08:38.088
diverse expertise especially,
nationality as well,

00:08:38.112 --> 00:08:40.481
were quite curious about
what each other brings.

00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:44.956
And they were willing to take risks
to learn fast what might work.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.206
And ultimately, 17 days
into this remarkable story,

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.971
ideas came from everywhere.

00:08:51.995 --> 00:08:55.473
They came from André Sougarret,
who is a brilliant mining engineer

00:08:55.497 --> 00:08:58.205
who was appointed by the government
to lead the rescue.

00:08:58.229 --> 00:08:59.871
They came from NASA.

00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:02.467
They came from Chilean Special Forces.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.331
They came from volunteers
around the world.

00:09:05.355 --> 00:09:09.646
And while many of us,
including myself, watched from afar,

00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:14.342
these folks made slow,
painful progress through the rock.

00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:18.370
On the 17th day, they
broke through to the refuge.

00:09:18.394 --> 00:09:20.346
It's just a remarkable moment.

00:09:20.905 --> 00:09:25.448
And with just a very small incision,
they were able to find it

00:09:25.472 --> 00:09:27.667
through a bunch
of experimental techniques.

00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:30.160
And then for the next 53 days,

00:09:30.184 --> 00:09:34.338
that narrow lifeline would be the path

00:09:34.362 --> 00:09:38.356
where food and medicine
and communication would travel,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.446
while aboveground, for 53 more days,
they continued the teaming

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.295
to find a way to create a much larger hole

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:49.755
and also to design a capsule.

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:50.968
This is the capsule.

00:09:50.992 --> 00:09:53.233
And then on the 69th day,

00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:56.042
over 22 painstaking hours,

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:59.252
they managed to pull
the miners out one by one.

00:09:59.276 --> 00:10:02.351
So how did they overcome
professional culture clash?

00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:06.778
I would say in a word, it's leadership,
but let me be more specific.

00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:08.723
When teaming works,

00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:11.580
you can be sure that some leaders,

00:10:11.604 --> 00:10:12.999
leaders at all levels,

00:10:13.023 --> 00:10:16.304
have been crystal clear
that they don't have the answers.

00:10:16.328 --> 00:10:18.665
Let's call this "situational humility."

00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:19.988
It's appropriate humility.

00:10:20.012 --> 00:10:21.605
We don't know how to do it.

00:10:21.629 --> 00:10:24.828
You can be sure, as I said before,
people were very curious,

00:10:24.852 --> 00:10:26.930
and this situational humility

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:29.115
combined with curiosity

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:31.705
creates a sense of psychological safety

00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:33.748
that allows you take risks with strangers,

00:10:33.772 --> 00:10:37.439
because let's face it:
it's hard to speak up, right?

00:10:37.463 --> 00:10:38.762
It's hard to ask for help.

00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:42.276
It's hard to offer an idea
that might be a stupid idea

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.016
if you don't know people very well.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.867
You need psychological safety to do that.

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:52.267
They overcame what I like to call
the basic human challenge:

00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.337
it's hard to learn if you already know.

00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:58.785
And unfortunately, we're hardwired
to think we know.

00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:02.103
And so we've got to remind ourselves --
and we can do it --

00:11:02.127 --> 00:11:03.317
to be curious;

00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:05.539
to be curious about what others bring.

00:11:05.563 --> 00:11:11.206
And that curiosity can also spawn
a kind of generosity of interpretation.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.904
But there's another barrier,
and you all know it.

00:11:14.928 --> 00:11:17.326
You wouldn't be in this room
if you didn't know it.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.785
And to explain it, I'm going to quote
from the movie "The Paper Chase."

00:11:20.809 --> 00:11:22.826
This, by the way, is what Hollywood thinks

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.966
a Harvard professor
is supposed to look like.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.248
You be the judge.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:28.282
The professor in this famous scene,

00:11:28.306 --> 00:11:31.368
he's welcoming the new 1L class,

00:11:31.392 --> 00:11:33.861
and he says, "Look to your left.
Look to your right.

00:11:33.885 --> 00:11:35.607
one of you won't be here next year."

00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:38.522
What message did they hear?
"It's me or you."

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.359
For me to succeed, you must fail.

00:11:41.383 --> 00:11:45.892
Now, I don't think too many organizations
welcome newcomers that way anymore,

00:11:45.916 --> 00:11:50.927
but still, many times people arrive
with that message of scarcity anyway.

00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:52.348
It's me or you.

00:11:52.372 --> 00:11:56.948
It's awfully hard to team if you
inadvertently see others as competitors.

00:11:56.972 --> 00:11:59.295
So we have to overcome that one as well,

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:02.961
and when we do,
the results can be awesome.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.394
Abraham Lincoln said once,

00:12:05.418 --> 00:12:09.003
"I don't like that man very much.
I must get to know him better."

00:12:09.827 --> 00:12:10.978
Think about that --

00:12:11.002 --> 00:12:13.744
I don't like him, that means
I don't know him well enough.

00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:14.919
It's extraordinary.

00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:16.616
This is the mindset, I have to say,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.037
this is the mindset you need
for effective teaming.

00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:23.826
In our silos, we can get things done.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.235
But when we step back
and reach out and reach across,

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:29.302
miracles can happen.

00:12:29.326 --> 00:12:31.157
Miners can be rescued,

00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:32.624
patients can be saved,

00:12:32.648 --> 00:12:35.565
beautiful films can be created.

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:38.786
To get there, I think there's
no better advice than this:

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:41.037
look to your left, look to your right.

00:12:41.061 --> 00:12:47.011
How quickly can you find
the unique talents, skills

00:12:47.035 --> 00:12:48.486
and hopes of your neighbor,

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.979
and how quickly, in turn,
can you convey what you bring?

00:12:52.003 --> 00:12:56.336
Because for us to team up
to build the future we know we can create

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.869
that none of us can do alone,

00:12:57.893 --> 00:12:59.475
that's the mindset we need.

00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.122
Thank you.

00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:04.895
(Applause)
