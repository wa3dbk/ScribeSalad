Chris Anderson:
Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.936
It's great to have you here.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.536
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.416
CA: So, in the next half hour or so,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.256
we're going to spend some time

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.176
exploring your vision for what
an exciting future might look like,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.296
which I guess makes
the first question a little ironic:

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.056
Why are you boring?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.296
EM: Yeah.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870
I ask myself that frequently.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.376
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.576
and this is to create the beginning

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.720
of what will hopefully
be a 3D network of tunnels

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.736
to alleviate congestion.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.296
So right now, one of the most
soul-destroying things is traffic.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.176
It affects people
in every part of the world.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.016
It takes away so much of your life.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.016
It's horrible.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.656
It's particularly horrible in LA.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.336
(Laughter)

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.296
CA: I think you've brought with you

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.775
the first visualization
that's been shown of this.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.136
Can I show this?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.856
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time --

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.736
Just to show what we're talking about.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.896
So a couple of key things
that are important

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.816
in having a 3D tunnel network.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.456
First of all, you have to be able

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.736
to integrate the entrance
and exit of the tunnel

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.816
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.496
So by having an elevator,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.296
sort of a car skate,
that's on an elevator,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.256
you can integrate the entrance
and exits to the tunnel network

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520
just by using two parking spaces.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.936
And then the car gets on a skate.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.336
There's no speed limit here,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.376
so we're designing this to be able
to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.616
CA: How much?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.960
EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
or about 130 miles per hour.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.016
So you should be able
to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.296
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.656
(Applause)

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.256
CA: So possibly, initially done,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.576
it's like on a sort
of toll road-type basis.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.816
EM: Yeah.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.896
CA: Which, I guess,
alleviates some traffic

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.616
from the surface streets as well.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.256
EM: So, I don't know
if people noticed it in the video,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.416
but there's no real limit
to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.256
You can go much further deep
than you can go up.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.456
The deepest mines are much deeper
than the tallest buildings are tall,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.736
so you can alleviate any arbitrary
level of urban congestion

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.056
with a 3D tunnel network.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.616
This is a very important point.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.016
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.816
that will simply alleviate congestion,
it will get used up,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.136
and then you'll be back where you started,
back with congestion.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.576
But you can go to any
arbitrary number of tunnels,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.936
any number of levels.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.496
CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
it's incredibly expensive to dig,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.296
and that would block this idea.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.016
EM: Yeah.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.256
Well, they're right.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.056
To give you an example,
the LA subway extension,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.736
which is -- I think it's
a two-and-a-half mile extension

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.999
that was just completed
for two billion dollars.

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:29.416
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
to do the subway extension in LA.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.416
And this is not the highest
utility subway in the world.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.936
So yeah, it's quite difficult
to dig tunnels normally.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.136
I think we need to have
at least a tenfold improvement

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.480
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.840
CA: And how could you achieve that?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.296
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.656
you can get to approximately
an order of magnitude improvement,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.856
and I think you can go beyond that.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.136
So the first thing to do
is to cut the tunnel diameter

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.776
by a factor of two or more.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.776
So a single road lane tunnel
according to regulations

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.656
has to be 26 feet,
maybe 28 feet in diameter

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.856
to allow for crashes
and emergency vehicles

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.136
and sufficient ventilation
for combustion engine cars.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.736
But if you shrink that diameter
to what we're attempting,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.416
which is 12 feet, which is plenty
to get an electric skate through,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.656
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.576
and the cross-sectional area
by a factor of four,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.456
and the tunneling cost scales
with the cross-sectional area.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.696
So that's roughly a half-order
of magnitude improvement right there.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.616
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
for half the time, then they stop,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.816
and then the rest of the time
is putting in reinforcements

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.136
for the tunnel wall.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.376
So if you design the machine instead

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.736
to do continuous
tunneling and reinforcing,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.976
that will give you
a factor of two improvement.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.216
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.896
Also these machines are far from being
at their power or thermal limits,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.976
so you can jack up the power
to the machine substantially.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.136
I think you can get
at least a factor of two,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.336
maybe a factor of four or five
improvement on top of that.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.576
So I think there's a fairly
straightforward series of steps

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.576
to get somewhere in excess
of an order of magnitude improvement

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.336
in the cost per mile,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.296
and our target actually is --

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.136
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.696
this is from Gary the snail
from "South Park,"

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.656
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.256
(Laughter)

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.696
So Gary is capable of --

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.816
currently he's capable
of going 14 times faster

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.616
than a tunnel-boring machine.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.416
(Laughter)

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.216
CA: You want to beat Gary.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.536
EM: We want to beat Gary.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.096
(Laughter)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.336
He's not a patient little fellow,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.456
and that will be victory.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.880
Victory is beating the snail.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.336
CA: But a lot of people imagining,
dreaming about future cities,

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.256
they imagine that actually
the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.496
You go aboveground.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.336
Why isn't that a better solution?

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.336
You save all that tunneling cost.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.576
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.456
Obviously, I do rockets,
so I like things that fly.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.416
This is not some inherent bias
against flying things,

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.496
but there is a challenge with flying cars

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.816
in that they'll be quite noisy,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.400
the wind force generated
will be very high.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.696
Let's just say that if something's
flying over your head,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.280
a whole bunch of flying cars
going all over the place,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.056
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.400
(Laughter)

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.760
You don't think to yourself,
"Well, I feel better about today."

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.136
You're thinking,
"Did they service their hubcap,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.056
or is it going to come off
and guillotine me?"

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.760
Things like that.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.896
CA: So you've got this vision

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.216
of future cities with these rich,
3D networks of tunnels underneath.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.256
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.816
Could you apply these tunnels
to use for this Hyperloop idea

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.221
you released a few years ago.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.056
EM: Yeah, so we've been
sort of puttering around

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.696
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.536
We built a Hyperloop test track
adjacent to SpaceX,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.696
just for a student competition,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.736
to encourage innovative
ideas in transport.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.776
And it actually ends up being
the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.720
after the Large Hadron Collider,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.000
by volume.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.776
So it was quite fun to do that,
but it was kind of a hobby thing,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.496
and then we think we might --

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.880
so we've built a little pusher car
to push the student pods,

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.376
but we're going to try seeing
how fast we can make the pusher go

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.829
if it's not pushing something.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.056
So we're cautiously optimistic

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:10.096
we'll be able to be faster
than the world's fastest bullet train

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.376
even in a .8-mile stretch.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.936
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.216
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.856
It's either going to smash
into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.456
CA: But you can picture,
then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.296
running quite long distances.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.016
EM: Exactly.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.816
And looking at tunneling technology,

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.376
it turns out that
in order to make a tunnel,

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.600
you have to --

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.696
In order to seal against the water table,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.376
you've got to typically design
a tunnel wall to be good

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.720
to about five or six atmospheres.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:50.176
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.616
or near-vacuum.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.056
So actually, it sort of turns out
that automatically,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.056
if you build a tunnel that is good enough
to resist the water table,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.496
it is automatically
capable of holding vacuum.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.136
CA: Huh.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.696
EM: So, yeah.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.576
CA: And so you could actually picture,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.296
what kind of length tunnel
is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.536
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.576
You could dig as much as you want.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.816
I think if you were to do something

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.016
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.896
I think you'd probably want
to go underground the entire way

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.536
because it's a high-density area.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.616
You're going under
a lot of buildings and houses,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.176
and if you go deep enough,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.576
you cannot detect the tunnel.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.536
Sometimes people think,
well, it's going to be pretty annoying

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.416
to have a tunnel dug under my house.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.776
Like, if that tunnel is dug

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.976
more than about three or four
tunnel diameters beneath your house,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.880
you will not be able
to detect it being dug at all.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:59.576
In fact, if you're able
to detect the tunnel being dug,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.216
whatever device you are using,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.506
you can get a lot of money
for that device from the Israeli military,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.326
who is trying to detect
tunnels from Hamas,

00:10:07.636 --> 00:10:12.416
and from the US Customs and Border patrol
that try and detect drug tunnels.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.656
So the reality is

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.536
that earth is incredibly good
at absorbing vibrations,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.536
and once the tunnel depth
is below a certain level,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.536
it is undetectable.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.136
Maybe if you have a very sensitive
seismic instrument,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.640
you might be able to detect it.

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.656
CA: So you've started
a new company to do this

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.376
called The Boring Company.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.336
Very nice. Very funny.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.736
(Laughter)

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.256
EM: What's funny about that?

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.896
(Laughter)

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.840
CA: How much of your time is this?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.720
EM: It's maybe ...

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.880
two or three percent.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.856
CA: You've called it a hobby.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.496
This is what an Elon Musk
hobby looks like.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.536
(Laughter)

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.016
EM: I mean, it really is, like --

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.920
This is basically interns
and people doing it part time.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.016
We bought some second-hand machinery.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.160
It's kind of puttering along,
but it's making good progress, so --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.896
CA: So an even bigger part of your time

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.200
is being spent on electrifying
cars and transport through Tesla.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.016
Is one of the motivations
for the tunneling project

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.576
the realization that actually,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.016
in a world where cars are electric
and where they're self-driving,

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.576
there may end up being
more cars on the roads

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.976
on any given hour than there are now?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.920
EM: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.336
A lot of people think
that when you make cars autonomous,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.976
they'll be able to go faster
and that will alleviate congestion.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.896
And to some degree that will be true,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.976
but once you have shared autonomy
where it's much cheaper to go by car

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.440
and you can go point to point,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.096
the affordability of going in a car
will be better than that of a bus.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.336
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:09.416
So the amount of driving that will occur
will be much greater with shared autonomy,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.296
and actually traffic will get far worse.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.576
CA: You started Tesla
with the goal of persuading the world

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.736
that electrification
was the future of cars,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.136
and a few years ago,
people were laughing at you.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.616
Now, not so much.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.856
EM: OK.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.816
(Laughter)

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.056
I don't know. I don't know.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.496
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
every auto manufacturer

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.536
has announced
serious electrification plans

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.200
for the short- to medium-term future?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.200
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.256
I think almost every automaker
has some electric vehicle program.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.536
They vary in seriousness.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.856
Some are very serious
about transitioning entirely to electric,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.240
and some are just dabbling in it.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.696
And some, amazingly,
are still pursuing fuel cells,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.856
but I think that won't last much longer.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.936
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.656
where you can now just declare victory
and say, you know, "We did it."

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.760
Let the world electrify,
and you go on and focus on other stuff?

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.720
EM: Yeah.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.896
I intend to stay with Tesla
as far into the future as I can imagine,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.576
and there are a lot of exciting
things that we have coming.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.776
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:31.200
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.056
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.056
So Model 3, it's supposed
to be coming in July-ish.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:43.616
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
for starting production in July.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.016
CA: Wow.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.416
One of the things
that people are so excited about

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.656
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.016
And you put out this video a while back

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.376
showing what that technology
would look like.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.616
EM: Yeah.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.126
CA: There's obviously autopilot
in Model S right now.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.536
What are we seeing here?

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:09.576
EM: Yeah, so this is using
only cameras and GPS.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.096
So there's no LIDAR
or radar being used here.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.160
This is just using passive optical,
which is essentially what a person uses.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.696
The whole road system
is meant to be navigated

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.776
with passive optical, or cameras,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.136
and so once you solve cameras

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.400
or vision,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.216
then autonomy is solved.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.520
If you don't solve vision,
it's not solved.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:40.136
So that's why our focus is
so heavily on having a vision neural net

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.376
that's very effective for road conditions.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.016
CA: Right. Many other people
are going the LIDAR route.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.896
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.296
EM: You can absolutely
be superhuman with just cameras.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.336
Like, you can probably do it
ten times better than humans would,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.616
just cameras.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.096
CA: So the new cars being sold right now
have eight cameras in them.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.456
They can't yet do what that showed.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.120
When will they be able to?

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:14.176
EM: I think we're still on track
for being able to go cross-country

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.376
from LA to New York by the end
of the year, fully autonomous.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.176
CA: OK, so by the end
of the year, you're saying,

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.176
someone's going to sit in a Tesla
without touching the steering wheel,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.696
tap in "New York," off it goes.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.936
EM: Yeah.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.160
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --
by the end of 2017.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.896
EM: Yeah. Essentially,
November or December of this year,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.336
we should be able to go all the way
from a parking lot in California

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.016
to a parking lot in New York,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.880
no controls touched at any point
during the entire journey.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.816
(Applause)

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.056
CA: Amazing.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.496
But part of that is possible

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.936
because you've already got a fleet
of Teslas driving all these roads.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.760
You're accumulating a huge amount
of data of that national road system.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.096
EM: Yes, but the thing
that will be interesting

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.200
is that I'm actually fairly confident
it will be able to do that route

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.200
even if you change the route dynamically.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.240
So, it's fairly easy --

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.776
If you say I'm going to be really good
at one specific route, that's one thing,

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:28.936
but it should be able to go,
really be very good,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.696
certainly once you enter a highway,

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.496
to go anywhere on the highway system

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.760
in a given country.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.336
So it's not sort of limited
to LA to New York.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.816
We could change it
and make it Seattle-Florida,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.376
that day, in real time.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.536
So you were going from LA to New York.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.280
Now go from LA to Toronto.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.056
CA: So leaving aside
regulation for a second,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.856
in terms of the technology alone,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.696
the time when someone
will be able to buy one of your cars

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.536
and literally just take the hands
off the wheel and go to sleep

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.616
and wake up and find that they've arrived,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.576
how far away is that, to do that safely?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.856
EM: I think that's about two years.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.256
So the real trick of it
is not how do you make it work

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.215
say 99.9 percent of the time,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.336
because, like, if a car crashes
one in a thousand times,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.336
then you're probably still not going
to be comfortable falling asleep.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.040
You shouldn't be, certainly.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.540
(Laughter)

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.935
It's never going to be perfect.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.695
No system is going to be perfect,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.319
but if you say it's perhaps --

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.936
the car is unlikely to crash

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.416
in a hundred lifetimes,
or a thousand lifetimes,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.336
then people are like, OK, wow,
if I were to live a thousand lives,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.976
I would still most likely
never experience a crash,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.376
then that's probably OK.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.616
CA: To sleep.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.496
I guess the big concern of yours
is that people may actually

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.816
get seduced too early
to think that this is safe,

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:05.376
and that you'll have some horrible
incident happen that puts things back.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.416
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
is likely to at least mitigate the crash,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.920
except in rare circumstances.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.576
The thing to appreciate
about vehicle safety

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.000
is this is probabilistic.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.376
I mean, there's some chance that any time
a human driver gets in a car,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.336
that they will have an accident
that is their fault.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.680
It's never zero.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.816
So really the key threshold for autonomy

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.256
is how much better does autonomy
need to be than a person

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.656
before you can rely on it?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.096
CA: But once you get
literally safe hands-off driving,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.936
the power to disrupt
the whole industry seems massive,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.336
because at that point you've spoken
of people being able to buy a car,

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.496
drops you off at work,
and then you let it go

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.496
and provide a sort of Uber-like
service to other people,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.736
earn you money,

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.216
maybe even cover the cost
of your lease of that car,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.096
so you can kind of get a car for free.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.376
Is that really likely?

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.256
EM: Yeah. Absolutely
this is what will happen.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.256
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.536
where you buy your car

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.976
and you can choose
to use that car exclusively,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.696
you could choose to have it be used
only by friends and family,

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.776
only by other drivers
who are rated five star,

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.680
you can choose to share it sometimes
but not other times.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.416
That's 100 percent what will occur.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.821
It's just a question of when.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.176
CA: Wow.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.416
So you mentioned the Semi

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.176
and I think you're planning
to announce this in September,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.296
but I'm curious whether there's
anything you could show us today?

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.176
EM: I will show you
a teaser shot of the truck.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.696
(Laughter)

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.656
It's alive.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.896
CA: OK.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.616
EM: That's definitely a case
where we want to be cautious

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:56.974
about the autonomy features.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.576
Yeah.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.216
(Laughter)

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.856
CA: We can't see that much of it,

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.096
but it doesn't look like
just a little friendly neighborhood truck.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.376
It looks kind of badass.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.560
What sort of semi is this?

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.736
EM: So this is a heavy duty,
long-range semitruck.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.016
So it's the highest weight capability

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:23.096
and with long range.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.560
So essentially it's meant to alleviate
the heavy-duty trucking loads.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.576
And this is something which
people do not today think is possible.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.336
They think the truck doesn't have enough
power or it doesn't have enough range,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.896
and then with the Tesla Semi

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.576
we want to show that no, an electric truck

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.616
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.776
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.856
the Tesla Semi
will tug the diesel semi uphill.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.136
(Laughter)

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.016
(Applause)

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.056
CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.400
These are going to be trucks
that truck drivers want to drive.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.096
EM: Yes. So what will be
really fun about this

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.496
is you have a flat torque RPM curve
with an electric motor,

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.016
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
of internal combustion engine car,

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.640
you've got a torque RPM curve
that looks like a hill.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.776
So this will be a very spry truck.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.656
You can drive this
around like a sports car.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.056
There's no gears.
It's, like, single speed.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.536
CA: There's a great movie
to be made here somewhere.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.336
I don't know what it is
and I don't know that it ends well,

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.576
but it's a great movie.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.616
(Laughter)

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.376
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.416
When I was driving the test prototype
for the first truck.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.696
It's really weird,
because you're driving around

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.816
and you're just so nimble,
and you're in this giant truck.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.336
CA: Wait, you've
already driven a prototype?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.456
EM: Yeah, I drove it
around the parking lot,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.936
and I was like, this is crazy.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.136
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.256
EM: It's just like,
driving this giant truck

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.256
and making these mad maneuvers.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.736
CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.376
to a kind of less badass picture.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.736
This is just a cute house
from "Desperate Housewives" or something.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.816
What on earth is going on here?

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.296
EM: Well, this illustrates
the picture of the future

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.296
that I think is how things will evolve.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.656
You've got an electric car
in the driveway.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.416
If you look in between
the electric car and the house,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.296
there are actually three Powerwalls
stacked up against the side of the house,

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.136
and then that house roof is a solar roof.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.256
So that's an actual solar glass roof.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:40.496
CA: OK.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.776
EM: That's a picture of a real --
well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.456
That's a real fake house.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.576
(Laughter)

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.456
CA: So these roof tiles,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:57.616
some of them have in them
basically solar power, the ability to --

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.336
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.456
where you can adjust
the texture and the color

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.456
to a very fine-grained level,

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.056
and then there's
sort of microlouvers in the glass,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.536
such that when you're looking
at the roof from street level

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.256
or close to street level,

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.656
all the tiles look the same

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.760
whether there is a solar cell
behind it or not.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.416
So you have an even color

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.936
from the ground level.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.056
If you were to look at it
from a helicopter,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.456
you would be actually able
to look through and see

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.496
that some of the glass tiles have
a solar cell behind them and some do not.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.136
You can't tell from street level.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.216
CA: You put them in the ones
that are likely to see a lot of sun,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.616
and that makes these roofs
super affordable, right?

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.616
They're not that much more expensive
than just tiling the roof.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.840
EM: Yeah.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.440
We're very confident
that the cost of the roof

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.760
plus the cost of electricity --

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.856
A solar glass roof will be less
than the cost of a normal roof

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.296
plus the cost of electricity.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.576
So in other words,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.936
this will be economically a no-brainer,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.656
we think it will look great,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.816
and it will last --

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.896
We thought about having
the warranty be infinity,

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.136
but then people thought,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.736
well, that might sound
like were just talking rubbish,

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:28.376
but actually this is toughened glass.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.296
Well after the house has collapsed

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.216
and there's nothing there,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.776
the glass tiles will still be there.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.376
(Applause)

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.136
CA: I mean, this is cool.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.016
So you're rolling this out
in a couple week's time, I think,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.576
with four different roofing types.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.136
EM: Yeah, we're starting off
with two, two initially,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.336
and the second two
will be introduced early next year.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.416
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.960
How many houses do you believe
could end up having this type of roofing?

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.160
EM: I think eventually

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.200
almost all houses will have a solar roof.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.416
The thing is to consider
the time scale here

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.896
to be probably on the order

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.096
of 40 or 50 years.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:22.000
So on average, a roof
is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.736
But you don't start replacing
all roofs immediately.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.096
But eventually,
if you say were to fast-forward

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.576
to say 15 years from now,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.200
it will be unusual to have a roof
that does not have solar.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.696
CA: Is there a mental model thing
that people don't get here

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:45.136
that because of the shift in the cost,
the economics of solar power,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.256
most houses actually have
enough sunlight on their roof

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.336
pretty much to power all of their needs.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.256
If you could capture the power,

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.336
it could pretty much
power all their needs.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.896
You could go off-grid, kind of.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.456
EM: It depends on where you are

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.736
and what the house size is
relative to the roof area,

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.616
but it's a fair statement to say

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.456
that most houses in the US
have enough roof area

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.440
to power all the needs of the house.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.976
CA: So the key to the economics

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.016
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.936
is the falling price
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.456
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.736
In many ways, that's almost
the core competency.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.016
And you've decided

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.256
that to really, like, own that competency,

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.736
you just have to build
the world's largest manufacturing plant

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.896
to double the world's supply
of lithium-ion batteries,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.216
with this guy. What is this?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.696
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.416
progress so far on the Gigafactory.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.336
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.296
that there's sort of
a diamond shape overall,

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.936
and when it's fully done,
it'll look like a giant diamond,

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.176
or that's the idea behind it,

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.696
and it's aligned on true north.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.456
It's a small detail.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.376
CA: And capable of producing, eventually,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.576
like a hundred gigawatt hours
of batteries a year.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.576
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
We think probably more, but yeah.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.976
CA: And they're actually
being produced right now.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.176
EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.536
I mean, is that speeded up?

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.256
EM: That's the slowed down version.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.056
(Laughter)

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.416
CA: How fast does it actually go?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.256
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.216
you can't actually see the cells
without a strobe light.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.440
It's just blur.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.876
(Laughter)

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.576
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
about what makes an exciting future

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.240
is a future where we no longer
feel guilty about energy.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.896
Help us picture this.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.936
How many Gigafactories, if you like,
does it take to get us there?

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.696
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.456
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.840
Most likely a hundred.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.696
CA: See, I find this amazing.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.696
You can picture what it would take

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.976
to move the world
off this vast fossil fuel thing.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.576
It's like you're building one,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.456
it costs five billion dollars,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.616
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.256
Like, it's kind of cool
that you can picture that project.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:24.760
And you're planning to do, at Tesla --
announce another two this year.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.336
EM: I think we'll announce locations

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.096
for somewhere between two
and four Gigafactories later this year.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.560
Yeah, probably four.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.656
CA: Whoa.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.296
(Applause)

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.376
No more teasing from you for here?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.200
Like -- where, continent?

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.680
You can say no.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.216
EM: We need to address a global market.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.456
CA: OK.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.816
(Laughter)

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.040
This is cool.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.720
I think we should talk for --

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.176
Actually, global market.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.296
I'm going to ask you one question
about politics, only one.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.576
I'm kind of sick of politics,
but I do want to ask you this.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:19.936
You're on a body now
giving advice to a guy --

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.176
EM: Who?

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.096
CA: Who has said he doesn't
really believe in climate change,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.456
and there's a lot of people out there
who think you shouldn't be doing that.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.376
They'd like you to walk away from that.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.760
What would you say to them?

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.336
EM: Well, I think that first of all,

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.896
I'm just on two advisory councils

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.736
where the format consists
of going around the room

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.656
and asking people's opinion on things,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.440
and so there's like a meeting
every month or two.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.776
That's the sum total of my contribution.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.576
But I think to the degree
that there are people in the room

00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.336
who are arguing in favor
of doing something about climate change,

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.360
or social issues,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.736
I've used the meetings I've had thus far

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:14.616
to argue in favor of immigration
and in favor of climate change.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.576
(Applause)

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.696
And if I hadn't done that,

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.536
that wasn't on the agenda before.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.800
So maybe nothing will happen,
but at least the words were said.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.896
CA: OK.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.800
(Applause)

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.336
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.816
Last time you were here,

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.536
you spoke about what seemed like
a kind of incredibly ambitious dream

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.856
to develop rockets
that were actually reusable.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.016
And you've only gone and done it.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.656
EM: Finally. It took a long time.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.256
CA: Talk us through this.
What are we looking at here?

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.416
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.016
coming back from
very high and fast in space.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.296
So just delivered the upper stage

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.416
at high velocity.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.296
I think this might have been
at sort of Mach 7 or so,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.280
delivery of the upper stage.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.880
(Applause)

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.336
CA: So that was a sped-up --

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.176
EM: That was the slowed down version.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.536
(Laughter)

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.056
CA: I thought that was
the sped-up version.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.416
But I mean, that's amazing,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.776
and several of these failed

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.736
before you finally
figured out how to do it,

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.656
but now you've done this,
what, five or six times?

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.976
EM: We're at eight or nine.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.616
CA: And for the first time,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.776
you've actually reflown
one of the rockets that landed.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.576
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.216
and then prepped it for flight again
and flew it again,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.416
so it's the first reflight
of an orbital booster

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.416
where that reflight is relevant.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.616
So it's important to appreciate
that reusability is only relevant

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.720
if it is rapid and complete.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.656
So like an aircraft or a car,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.056
the reusability is rapid and complete.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.136
You do not send your aircraft
to Boeing in-between flights.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.976
CA: Right. So this is allowing you
to dream of this really ambitious idea

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.176
of sending many, many, many people to Mars

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.616
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.016
EM: Yeah.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.456
CA: And you've designed
this outrageous rocket to do it.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.896
Help us understand
the scale of this thing.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.800
EM: Well, visually
you can see that's a person.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.496
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.176
(Laughter)

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.936
CA: So if that was a skyscraper,

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.296
that's like, did I read that,
a 40-story skyscraper?

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.920
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.360
The thrust level of this is really --

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.280
This configuration is about four times
the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.296
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
rocket humanity ever created before.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.520
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.096
CA: As one does.
EM: Yeah.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:09.096
(Laughter)

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.096
In units of 747, a 747 is only about
a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.216
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.936
there's 40 747s.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:26.216
So this would be the thrust equivalent
of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.456
CA: And so even with a machine
designed to escape Earth's gravity,

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.896
I think you told me last time

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.176
this thing could actually
take a fully loaded 747,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.536
people, cargo, everything,

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.816
into orbit.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.976
EM: Exactly. This can take
a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.496
maximum passengers,
maximum cargo on the 747 --

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.760
this can take it as cargo.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.816
CA: So based on this,

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.656
you presented recently
this Interplanetary Transport System

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.056
which is visualized this way.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.160
This is a scene you picture in, what,
30 years time? 20 years time?

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.456
People walking into this rocket.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.056
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
an eight- to 10-year time frame.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.456
Aspirationally, that's our target.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.496
Our internal targets
are more aggressive, but I think --

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.679
(Laughter)

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.815
CA: OK.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.976
EM: While vehicle seems quite large

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.176
and is large by comparison
with other rockets,

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:33.176
I think the future spacecraft

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:37.040
will make this look like a rowboat.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.016
The future spaceships
will be truly enormous.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.216
CA: Why, Elon?

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:49.376
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.456
with a million people
on it in your lifetime,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.480
which I think is kind of
what you've said you'd love to do?

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.239
EM: I think it's important to have

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.856
a future that is inspiring and appealing.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.656
I just think there have to be reasons

00:35:06.679 --> 00:35:09.616
that you get up in the morning
and you want to live.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.096
Like, why do you want to live?

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.856
What's the point? What inspires you?

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.736
What do you love about the future?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.256
And if we're not out there,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.296
if the future does not include
being out there among the stars

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.016
and being a multiplanet species,

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.536
I find that it's incredibly depressing

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.896
if that's not the future
that we're going to have.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.096
(Applause)

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.456
CA: People want to position this
as an either or,

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:38.176
that there are so many desperate things
happening on the planet now

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:41.640
from climate to poverty
to, you know, you pick your issue.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.016
And this feels like a distraction.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.856
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.056
You should be solving what's here and now.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.016
And to be fair, you've done
a fair old bit to actually do that

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.856
with your work on sustainable energy.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.920
But why not just do that?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.440
EM: I think there's --

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:09.256
I look at the future
from the standpoint of probabilities.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.456
It's like a branching
stream of probabilities,

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:18.480
and there are actions that we can take
that affect those probabilities

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.120
or that accelerate one thing
or slow down another thing.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.120
I may introduce something new
to the probability stream.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.016
Sustainable energy
will happen no matter what.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.536
If there was no Tesla,
if Tesla never existed,

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.416
it would have to happen out of necessity.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.016
It's tautological.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.696
If you don't have sustainable energy,
it means you have unsustainable energy.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.336
Eventually you will run out,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.176
and the laws of economics
will drive civilization

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.856
towards sustainable energy,

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.096
inevitably.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.096
The fundamental value
of a company like Tesla

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.536
is the degree to which it accelerates
the advent of sustainable energy,

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.322
faster than it would otherwise occur.

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.336
So when I think, like,

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.096
what is the fundamental good
of a company like Tesla,

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.816
I would say, hopefully,

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:16.456
if it accelerated that by a decade,
potentially more than a decade,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.616
that would be quite a good thing to occur.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.256
That's what I consider to be

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.360
the fundamental
aspirational good of Tesla.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:31.816
Then there's becoming a multiplanet
species and space-faring civilization.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.776
This is not inevitable.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.496
It's very important to appreciate
this is not inevitable.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.616
The sustainable energy future
I think is largely inevitable,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.376
but being a space-faring civilization
is definitely not inevitable.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.576
If you look at the progress in space,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.200
in 1969 you were able
to send somebody to the moon.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.240
1969.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.736
Then we had the Space Shuttle.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.176
The Space Shuttle could only
take people to low Earth orbit.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.736
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.160
and the United States
could take no one to orbit.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.576
So that's the trend.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.280
The trend is like down to nothing.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.936
People are mistaken when they think

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.056
that technology
just automatically improves.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.976
It does not automatically improve.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.656
It only improves if a lot of people
work very hard to make it better,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:28.456
and actually it will, I think,
by itself degrade, actually.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.896
You look at great civilizations
like Ancient Egypt,

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.856
and they were able to make the pyramids,

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.696
and they forgot how to do that.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:37.536
And then the Romans,
they built these incredible aqueducts.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.760
They forgot how to do it.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.776
CA: Elon, it almost seems,
listening to you

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.056
and looking at the different
things you've done,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.856
that you've got this unique
double motivation on everything

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.200
that I find so interesting.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.296
One is this desire to work
for humanity's long-term good.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.656
The other is the desire
to do something exciting.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.376
And often it feels like you feel
like you need the one to drive the other.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.496
With Tesla, you want
to have sustainable energy,

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:11.056
so you made these super sexy,
exciting cars to do it.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.776
Solar energy, we need to get there,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.753
so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

00:39:14.777 --> 00:39:16.976
We haven't even spoken
about your newest thing,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.536
which we don't have time to do,

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.896
but you want to save humanity from bad AI,

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.216
and so you're going to create
this really cool brain-machine interface

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.096
to give us all infinite memory
and telepathy and so forth.

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.816
And on Mars, it feels
like what you're saying is,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.536
yeah, we need to save humanity

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:35.936
and have a backup plan,

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.216
but also we need to inspire humanity,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:43.760
and this is a way to inspire.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.456
EM: I think the value
of beauty and inspiration

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.456
is very much underrated,

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.056
no question.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.336
But I want to be clear.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.176
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.400
That is not the --

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.016
I'm just trying to think about the future

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.240
and not be sad.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.496
(Applause)

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.720
CA: Beautiful statement.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.776
I think everyone here would agree

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.000
that it is not --

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.856
None of this is going
to happen inevitably.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.536
The fact that in your mind,
you dream this stuff,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.136
you dream stuff that no one else
would dare dream,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.816
or no one else
would be capable of dreaming

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.496
at the level of complexity that you do.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.696
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,
is a really remarkable thing.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.416
Thank you for helping us all
to dream a bit bigger.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.936
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever
starts getting genuinely insane, right?

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.456
(Laughter)

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.576
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
That was really, really fantastic.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.016
That was really fantastic.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:49.120
(Applause)
