00:00:02.148 --> 00:00:08.652
 VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR FAUN LABYRINT FILM! 

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:26.512
 I think it's okay to start analyzing the Faun's Labyrinth from Guilerme del Tora's spoiler. 

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:31.292
 Ophelia, the heroine, dies at the end. 

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:36.272
 I think it's okay to say that, because del Toro does the same in film. 

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:39.062
 The first shot of Faun's Labyrinth is at the same time the end of the film. 

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.443
 And that makes del Toro complicate the end. 

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:47.103
 But before we get to him, let's just say a few things about fairy tales. 

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:52.613
 For most of us, Walt Disney is a source of fairy tales. 

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:56.275
 It's no coincidence. Walt Disney was the king of fairy tales, 

00:00:56.275 --> 00:00:59.506
 when he made classic fairy tales like Snow White, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty 

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:04.736
 in a completely new way, and copyrights have emerged. 

00:01:04.736 --> 00:01:07.596
 However, because the film was a relatively new medium, 

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.417
 taking the royal throne required Disney, 

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:14.177
 to remain true to the original versions of these stories 

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:17.757
 which was popularized by Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. 

00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:21.437
 Switching from book to cinema made as smooth as possible 

00:01:21.437 --> 00:01:26.807
 and even went so far as to start making movies by opening a book. 

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:29.938
 Disney was smart. His films are now considered classic. 

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:35.288
 And despite being true to the 19th century 

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:39.729
 he remained faithful and deepened the morality of the 19th century. 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.379
 Conservative Patriarchal System of Values 

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:46.239
 in which the prince always comes to the aid of a helpless heroine. 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.439
 A system of values ​​that was obsolete at that time. 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.850
 In this way, Disney has limited things that are possible in fairy tales. 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.410
 In Faun's Labyrinth, Guillermo del Toro tries 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.450
 demolish these boundaries and do so by changing the context of these stories. 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.989
 Instead of drawing from one source, del Toro draws on a large number of resources 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:10.599
 and neither of them places more weight than the other, 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.549
 leaving them to act against one another, 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.729
 to create a new context. 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:17.719
 The film tells the story of the little girl of Ophelia and her mother Karmen, 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.410
 who decides to live with the high-ranking fascist Vidal 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.840
 five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War. 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.462
 Vidal tries to suppress the last remnants of the resistance in the mountains, 

00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:30.220
 while expecting the birth of her child. 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.890
 Meanwhile, Ophelia finds herself on a magical quest afterwards 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.470
 what Faun tells her is the lost princess of the underground kingdom. 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.541
 From there, the story unfolds in two parallel storylines. 

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.462
 It becomes a magical expedition and a political drama. 

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:50.342
 What is important is that neither story goes down the other. 

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:53.542
 Del Toro did this by combining these stories in a way 

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:57.191
 which makes any effort to explain them problematic. 

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:02.943
 At the end of the film, we see a seemingly hard blow to the story of Ophelia. 

00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:07.933
 Vidal comes to Ophelia speaking with Faun, and when the camera approaches his gaze, 

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.613
 Faun's gone. 

00:03:09.613 --> 00:03:12.843
 This seems to be a clear proof that Ophelia dreamed of the expedition, 

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:15.643
 to deal more easily with her sad life. 

00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:19.292
 But if we go back, we see how del Toro complicates 

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:25.012
 that scene by Vidal drank a strong dose of sleeping medication. 

00:03:25.012 --> 00:03:28.433
 Elsewhere, drug-induced hallucinations are used to explain 

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:33.173
 why people see supernatural things, but in Faun's labyrinth it is the other way around. 

00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:38.353
 Del Toro uses this means to question what Vidal sees. 

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:41.983
 Here and elsewhere, the film refuses to obey our desire 

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:44.443
 after an all-explaining denouement. 

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:48.093
 Obviously, disobedience is the main theme in this film. 

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.563
 Why didn't you listen to me? 

00:03:49.563 --> 00:03:55.114
 To obey, to obey without question 

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.244
 is something that only people like you are capable of, Captain. 

00:04:00.244 --> 00:04:04.660
 While in many other fairy tales disobedience is used to start the story, 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.475
 here, disobedience is displayed as a fundamental and important value. 

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:11.965
 We see the disobedience of the rebels who want to liberate Spain 

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.356
 from the crack of fascism. 

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:16.076
 Disobedience Mercedes, which works with the rebels 

00:04:16.076 --> 00:04:21.436
 and, of course, the disobedience of Ophelia, which challenges and neglects commands 

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.305
 your mother, captain, and fauna. 

00:04:25.305 --> 00:04:32.455
 But the most impressive disobedience is that depicted in the very context of the film. 

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:36.025
 And here are del Tor's references to the word. 

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:42.626
 It accomplishes many interpretations of what we see that undermines authoritative characters 

00:04:42.626 --> 00:04:48.686
 Vidala and generally fascists and interacting links, 

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.576
 whose tone is purely our choice. 

00:04:51.576 --> 00:04:55.286
 Take all those links at Fauna's headquarters. 

00:04:55.286 --> 00:04:58.836
 We see a giant who enjoys eating a baby 

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:00.727
 and other mythologies like Krampuse 

00:05:00.727 --> 00:05:04.987
 or references to the Greek titan Kronos, who has eaten his children, 

00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:10.177
 to prevent young people from taking their place, just like fascism in Spain. 

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:14.037
 I should also mention that Kronos is the name of the first del Toro film. 

00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:17.078
 It's one thing that connects him with his work. 

00:05:17.078 --> 00:05:22.948
 The table refers to the previous scene and Fauna puts it in the same position as Vidala, 

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.338
 who then kills the child. 

00:05:24.338 --> 00:05:27.118
 Pile of shoes refers to Ophelia's red shoes, 

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:30.739
 which gets at a later stage of the film and are themselves a reference 

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:35.138
 the Wizard of Oz and the 1948 film by Powell and Pressburger. 

00:05:35.138 --> 00:05:38.809
 We can also interpret it as a reference to piles of clothing 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:44.133
 the Nazi concentration camps and the scene itself act as a metaphor 

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:47.950
 for the way we beauty fairy tales us 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.870
 can charm and force us to think in a way 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.880
 which may not be in our interest. 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.229
 Here you have an extensive network of commands that interfere with other parts of the movie 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:01.659
 but also beyond. 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.179
 The viewer is supposed to follow this as he sees fit. 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:10.140
 Del Toro intertwines these links with camera and editing 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.280
 thus moving the story forward. 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.311
 If you're watching his movies, you can't deny it. 

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:20.440
 The purpose of the vidal was, as well as the purpose of all authoritarian regimes 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.851
 or patriarchal moralistic fairy tales, limit the number and kind of stories 

00:06:26.851 --> 00:06:29.881
 which can be narrated and supported by facts or events 

00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:32.942
 to just one story. 

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:37.072
 The only way is to disobey. 

00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:44.372
 The old fairy tales had a closed story that ended in one word: the end. 

00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:49.452
 Del Toro's genius is to use a stereotypical genre 

00:06:49.452 --> 00:06:55.103
 and disobeying our expectations of how the story was to develop and end. 

00:06:55.103 --> 00:06:59.393
 The rebels will capture and kill Vidal, but Spain will remain in control 

00:06:59.393 --> 00:07:02.573
 authoritarian dictatorship for 30 years. 

00:07:02.573 --> 00:07:05.703
 Ophelia is murdered but completes her expedition 

00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:07.833
 and return to the underground kingdom. 

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.294
 You can perceive it as a poetic end to a sad story 

00:07:11.294 --> 00:07:17.022
 as a happy ending of the fairy tale or as Ophelia's last choice in the story 

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:20.313
 who wants to talk about himself. 

00:07:20.313 --> 00:07:23.143
 Of course, they do not have to choose. 

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:27.182
 There could be no separate story on it. 

00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:30.803
 Because even when she returned to the world of magic, 

00:07:30.803 --> 00:07:36.183
 she left references from the times she walked among us for you 

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:41.084
 who know where to find them.
