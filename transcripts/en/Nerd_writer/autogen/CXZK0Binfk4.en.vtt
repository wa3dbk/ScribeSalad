00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.280
Like all artists, filmmakers have a unique set of tools at their disposal:

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.600
cameras, lenses, lights, microphones, music.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.320
And they use these tools to tell their story
or upset a scene.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.140
The director David Lynch has of course
the same tools as everybody else,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.040
but Lynch manipulates more than
just these physical instruments.

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.940
More deeply and more strangely, 
than any other director I know of

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.100
he uses expectation as a tool.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.100
He wields expectation, expectation that comes from what we know about film,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.160
about its history, the history of stories
and from our humanity

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.640
with the same nuance and power,
as someone else might use light

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.660
to create a variety of moods in a space.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.540
Today I want to look at how Lynch manipulates our expectations in a single scene from his masterpiece "Mulholland Drive".

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.960
That guide us towards some
interesting emotional territory.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.329
The scene I'm talking about is one of my favourite ever.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.229
The audition scene, where Betty, played by Naomi Watts, tries out for a part

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.159
in a small movie, we later learn is called the
"Sylvia North Story".

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.859
The scene occurs about halfway through
the film.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.999
Betty has come to Hollywood, bright eyed and bushy tailed, to be a movie star.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.100
"Of course I'd rather be known as a great actress, than a movie star,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.460
but you know sometimes people end up being both".

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.420
She's staying at her aunt's house, 
where she discovers Rita

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.639
a woman who's been in a car accident
 and has lost all her memory.

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.839
Our expectations for the audition have
already been set up

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.400
by much of what we've witnessed
leading up to the scene.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.889
Betty doesn't seem to be a character
with much internal depth or darkness.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.899
Her flatness of affect is even parodied in
her very first scene at the airport,

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.289
where the dialogue is clearly overdubbed
and fake.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.380
"Okay Irene, won't that be the day."

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.200
Her blind kindness makes her
vulnerable to exploitation.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.100
She doesn't even really care, that a stranger
is living in her aunt's house.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.630
So coming into the audition we're feeling a couple things

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.530
We are somewhat invested in Betty success, a basic expectation for any protagonist,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.330
but more wary of some danger that may be in store because of her innocence

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.100
and we have little or no expectation, that she will impress with her acting chops.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.420
"Betty, why don't you join Woody over
there and we'll play the scene."

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.980
And of course the last thing to mention is that we've already seen the scene played out once before,

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.920
back at the house, practice round to try
out for a trial with Betty and Rita.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.680
"You're still here?"

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.040
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.410
"Nobody wants you here!"

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.100
In this first reading the scene is revealed to be trite.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.840
The dialogue clichéd and melodramatic, Betty's character rebukes her father's friend

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.780
who is trying to seduce her,
for the second time it seems.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.860
And she moves closer and closer, as her
threats become more stern.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.940
The two women can't even finish without laughing at the soap opera quality of the script.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.880
"Then I cry, cry, cry,"

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.130
"and then I say with big emotion: I hate you, I hate us both!"

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.590
So a universe of expectation has been
laid out for the viewer.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.740
Will see in a second how those expectations will work as a trap,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.960
but at the start everything in the audition room seems to reinforce what we already think:

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.150
the people are about as stiff as the gaudy wood paneling,

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.800
Betty's reading partner Woody looks like a star of "All my children", who spent a little too much time in the Sun,

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.720
the director is absent minded and
laughable.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.170
So, when the scene begins and Woody crawls Betty
into his slimy grasp,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.260
what triggers first is our awareness
of how vulnerable she is.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.999
And when she pushes him away, we don't know if she's reacting as herself or as the character

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.100
"Nobody wants you here!"

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.560
Then Woody moves to put his hands below her waist and something incredible happens.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.440
A transformation so sudden, that
the viewer experiences whiplash.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.840
As the critic George Toles notes we allured into engaging emotionally with the scene.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.260
When Lynch triggers our expectation
 that Betty might be exploited,

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.540
we've dropped our guard a little, but
it's already too much.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.180
We've surrendered enough so that when Lynch switches the bait, we are left in awe at what happens next.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.700
"You know what I want...

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.360
it's not that difficult."

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
"Get out!"

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.180
"Get out before I call my dad...

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.760
he trusts you...

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
you're his best friend."

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.349
All throughout the film from the overdubbed
dialogue on down

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.919
David Lynch has made us privy to the
veneer of things.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.139
It's all curiously two-dimensional
and that puts us on our guard.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.600
Since surfaces are what we get Lynch encourages us to examine those surfaces,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.300
always remaining detached enough for a disinterested critical view of what we're seeing.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.480
But as with everything that Lynch does, this two-dimensionality, this flatness is also a deception.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.660
"...and I know you said you would entertain suggestions

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.500
and that's all anybody here is asking you to do."

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.200
"What are you talking about?"

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.500
While we think we're on our guard, superior to the cloying emotions of Hollywood wish fulfilment,

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.620
Lynch relishes dropping the bottom out,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:19.620
showing us just how unprepared and susceptible we are to emotions that our society treasures or deeply fears.

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:25.549
In a scene that mirrors the audition, Betty and Rita go to a place called club Silencio,

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:27.500
where a special show is underway.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.580
The host repeats again and again:

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.220
"No hay banda!"

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.100
"There is no band!"

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.020
Everything you're hearing he says
is a tape-recording.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.040
Expectations for the scene are made
totally explicit.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.900
Then a woman comes out and sings a truly heartbreaking Spanish version of Roy Orbison's "Crying".

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:56.250
Lynch pushes tight into her face in an extreme close up and the film begins to taunt us.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.900
What's at stake here as in
any movie is belief.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.050
Can the director make you believe the
artifice being presented to you.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.730
That's why directors use expectations we
inculcated from other films.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.380
When two people lock eyes for the first time 
and the camera pushes in

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.480
that's love at first sight.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.120
This is one way to generate belief.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.720
The definition of expectation is a strong belief that something will happen.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.360
But Lynch goes a step further.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.520
In one way he sets up an expectation, then lures you into believing the opposite.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.880
So when the rug is pulled out, the audience is left suspended, caught out and captured;

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.420
engaging fully with the terrifying nothingness that they were warned against.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.860
When the film finally takes its hard right turn revealing Betty's true story of pain and degradation,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.720
we're confronted again with the same feeling, believing we're going to get the key to the mystery,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.760
but instead are only sunk
deeper into the dream.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.339
It's worth noting by the way, that this all comes from an expectation that goes unfulfilled.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.780
But the audition scene plays the reverse
feeling, and I think this is important.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.990
Instead of pulling the rug out to reveal
an abyss

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:28.240
we come in fully prepared and analytical, only to be dropped into a space of raw and honest emotion.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.380
Even though we know it's acted,
even though we know this is a film,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:37.880
we are entranced, totally believing the moment not because our expectations were fulfilled,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.780
but because they were subverted in a way that we didn't think was possible.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.860
"And then I cry, cry, cry, and then I say with big emotion:
I hate you!"

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.660
"I hate us both.."

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.460
Not content with the dreams that Hollywood has been feeding us and mass for decades,

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.640
David Lynch uses clichéd expectation to move us
into the spaces film has yet to go,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.960
showing us the dangers and
the hopes of believing.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.790
"Oh... I can't believe it"

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.620

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.760
That's a lot of Lynch in a week period. Anyway
