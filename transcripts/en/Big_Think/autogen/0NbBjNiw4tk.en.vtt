00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.969
My name is Professor Michio Kaku. &nbsp;I'm a
professor of theoretical physics at the City

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.969
University of New York and I specialize in
something called string theory. &nbsp;I'm a physicist.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.660
Some people ask me the question, "What has

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
physics done for me lately? &nbsp;I mean, do I
get better color television, do I get better

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.020
internet reception with physics?" &nbsp;And the
answer is yes. &nbsp;You see, physics is at the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.820
very foundation of matter and energy. &nbsp;We
physicists invented the laser beam, we invented

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.980
the transistor. &nbsp;We helped to create the
first computer. &nbsp;We helped to construct the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.980
internet. &nbsp;We wrote the World Wide Web. &nbsp;In
addition, we also helped to invent television,

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:03.999
radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI
scans, PET scans, x-rays. &nbsp;In other words,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.590
almost everything you see in your living room,
almost everything you see in a modern hospital,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.409
at some point or other, can be traced to a
physicist.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.840
Now, I got interested in physics when I was
a child.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.909
When I was eight,
a great scientist had just died. &nbsp;I still

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.020
remember my elementary school teacher coming
into the room and announcing that the greatest

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.860
scientist of our era has just passed away.
&nbsp;And that day, every newspaper published

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.860
a picture of his desk. &nbsp;The desk of Albert
Einstein. &nbsp;And the caption said, I'll never

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.250
forget, "The unfinished manuscript of the
greatest work of the greatest scientist of

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.840
our time." &nbsp;And I said to myself, "Why couldn't
he finish it? &nbsp;I mean, what's so hard? &nbsp;It's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.649
a homework problem, right? &nbsp;Why didn't he
ask his mother? &nbsp;Why can't he finish this

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.229
problem?" &nbsp;So as a child of eight, I decided
to find out what was this problem.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.229
Years later, I began to realize that it was
the theory of everything, the Unified Field

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.040
Theory.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.790
An equation that would summarize
all the physical forces in the universe. &nbsp;An

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.790
equation like E=mc². &nbsp;That equation is half
an inch long and that equation unlocks the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.440
secret of the stars. &nbsp;Why do the stars shine?
&nbsp;Why does the galaxy light up? &nbsp;Why do we

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.060
have energy on the earth?

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.140
But then there was another thing that happened
to me when I was around eight years old. &nbsp;I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.140
got hooked on the Saturday morning TV shows.
&nbsp;In particular, Flash Gordon. &nbsp;And I was

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.210
hooked. &nbsp;I mean, every Saturday morning watching
programs about alien from outer space, star

00:02:53.210 --> 00:03:00.210
ships, ray guns, invisibility shields, cities
in the sky, that was for me. &nbsp;But after a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.230
few years, I began to notice something. &nbsp;First
of all, I began to notice that well, I didn't

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.870
have blond hair and blue eyes, I didn't have
muscles like Flash Gordon, but it was a scientist

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.630
who made the series work. &nbsp;In particular,
a physicist. &nbsp;He was the one who discovered

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.980
the ray gun, the star ships.&nbsp;He

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.830
was the one who created the invisibility shield.
&nbsp;And then I realized something else. &nbsp;If

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.760
you want to understand the future, you have
to understand physics. &nbsp;Physics is at the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.760
foundation of all the gadgetry, the wizardry,
all the marvels of the technological age,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.990
all of it can be traced to the work of a physicist.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.740
&nbsp;
Physics and the Impossible

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.740
Physics and the Impossible

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.600
Most of science fiction is in fact well within
the laws of physics, but possible within maybe

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.390
100 years. &nbsp;And then we have 
impossibilities that may take 1,000 years

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.300
or more. &nbsp;That includes time travel, warp
drive, higher dimensions, portals through

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.770
space and time, star gates, worm holes.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.790
You know, if you were to meet your grandparents
at the year 1900, they were dirt farmers back

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.810
then. &nbsp;They didn't live much beyond the age
of 40, on average. &nbsp;Long distance communication

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.370
in the year 1900 was yelling at your neighbor.
&nbsp;And yet, if they could see you now, with

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.849
iPads and iPods and satellites and GPS and
laser beams, how would they view you? &nbsp;They

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.289
They would view you as a wizard or sorcerer.

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:43.289
However, if we can now meet our grandkids
of the year 2100, how would we view them?

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:51.259
We would view them as gods, like in Greek
mythology. &nbsp;Zeus could control objects around

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.110
him by pure thought. &nbsp;Materialize objects
just by thinking. &nbsp;And there're perks to

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.680
being a Greek god, Venus had a perfect body,
a timeless body. &nbsp;And we are beginning now

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.680
to unravel the genetics at the molecular level,
of the aging process. &nbsp;And then Apollo, he

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.640
had a chariot that he could ride across the
heavens. &nbsp;We will finally have that flying

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.330
car that we've always wanted to have in our garage.

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.349
By the year 2100,
we will have the power of the gods.

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:31.349
To paraphrase Arthur C. Clark, "Any sufficiently
advanced technology is indistinguishable from

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.780
from divinity."

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.759
So let's now begin our story.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.870
The History of Physics

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:46.530
The history of physics is the history of modern
civilization. &nbsp;Before Isaac Newton, before

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.340
Galileo, we were shrouded with the mysteries
of superstition. &nbsp;People believed in all

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.340
sorts of different kinds of spirits and demons.
&nbsp;What made the planets move? &nbsp;Why do things

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.139
things interact with other things? &nbsp;It was a mystery.

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.099
So, back in the Middle Ages, for example,
people read the works of Aristotle. &nbsp;And

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.539
Aristotle asked the question, "Why do objects
move toward the earth? &nbsp;And that's because,"

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.389
he said, "objects yearn, yearn to be united
with the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;And why do objects slow

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:28.050
down when you put them in motion? &nbsp;Objects
in motion slow down because they get tired."

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:35.050
These are the works of Aristotle, which
held sway for almost 2,000 years until the

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:41.469
beginning of modern physics with Galileo and
Isaac Newton.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:48.469
When the ancients looked at the sky, the
sky was full of mystery and wonder, and in

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:55.979
the year 1066, the most important date on
the British calendar, there was a comet, a

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.169
comet which sailed over the battlefield of
Hastings. &nbsp;It frightened the troops of King

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:03.160
Harold, and a young man from Normandy, swept
into England and defeated King Harold at the

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.129
Battle of Hastings, creating the modern British
monarchy.

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:21.559
But the question is, where did the comet come
from? &nbsp;What was this comet that mysteriously

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:25.110
paved the way for the coming of the British
monarchy?

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:32.110
Well, believe it or not, that same comet,
the very same comet that initiated the British

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.990
monarchy, sailed over London once again in
1682. &nbsp;This time, everyone was asking the

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:47.870
question, "Where do comets come from? &nbsp;Do
they signal the death of the king? &nbsp;Why do

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:54.870
we have messengers from heavens in the sky?"
&nbsp;Well, one man dared to penetrate the secrets

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:01.099
of comets, and that was Isaac Newton. &nbsp;In
fact, when Isaac Newton was only 23 years

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:05.309
old, he stumbled upon the universal force
of gravitation.

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:12.150
According to one story, he was walking on
his estate in Woolsthorpe, and he saw an apple

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:18.740
fall. &nbsp;And then Isaac Newton saw the moon,
and then he asked the key question which helped

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:25.740
to unlock the heavens. &nbsp;If apples falls,
does the moon also fall? &nbsp;And the answer

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:35.819
was, "Yes." &nbsp;And answer overturned thousands
of years of mystery and speculation about

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:43.599
the motions of the heavens. &nbsp;The moon is
in freefall, just like an apple. &nbsp;The moon

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:50.550
is constantly falling toward the earth. &nbsp;It
doesn't hit the earth, because it spins around

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:57.550
the earth, and the earth is round, but it's
acting under a force, a force of gravity.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.770
So Newton immediately tried to work out the
mathematics and he realized that the mathematics

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:10.770
of the 1600's was not sufficient to work out
the motion of a falling moon. &nbsp;So what did

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.970
Isaac Newton do? &nbsp;When he was 23 years old,
not only did he stumble upon the force of

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:23.970
gravity, but he also created calculus. &nbsp;In
fact, he created calculus at the rate at which you

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:30.790
learn it, when you are a freshman in college.
&nbsp;And why did he create calculus? &nbsp;To calculate

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:37.650
the motion of a falling moon. &nbsp;The mathematics
of his age was incapable of calculating the

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.000
trajectories of objects moving under an inverse
square force field, and that's what Isaac

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.840
Newton did. &nbsp;He worked out the motion of
the moon. &nbsp;And then he realized that if he

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.840
understands the moon, he also understands
the motion of the planets in the solar system.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:03.020
And Isaac Newton invented a new telescope.
&nbsp;It was the reflecting telescope and he was

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.180
tracking the motion of this comet.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:12.150
Well, it turns out that everyone was talking
about the comet, including a rather wealthy

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.990
Englishman by the name of Edmund Haley. So Edmund Haley,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:23.690
being a wealthy merchant, decided to make
a trip to Cambridge to talk to England's illustrious

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:29.950
scientist, Sir Isaac Newton. &nbsp;Well, Edmund
Haley asked Newton, "What do you make of this

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.500
comet? &nbsp;No one understands comets, they're
a mystery. &nbsp;They've been fascinating people

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:41.530
for centuries, for millennia, what are your
thoughts?" &nbsp;And then, I paraphrase, but Isaac

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:48.400
Newton said something like this, he said,
"Oh, that's easy. &nbsp;That comet is moving at

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.600
a perfect ellipse. &nbsp;It's moving in an inverse
square force field. &nbsp;I've been tracking it

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:01.320
every day with my reflecting telescope and
the path of that comet conforms to my mathematics

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.860
exactly." &nbsp;And of course, we don't know what
Edmund Haley's reaction was, but I paraphrase,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:13.710
he must have said something like this, he
said, "For God's sake, man, why don't you

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:20.710
publish the greatest work in all of scientific
history? &nbsp;If correct, you have decoded the

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:28.330
secret of the stars, the secret of the heavens.
&nbsp;Nobody understands where comets come from."

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.880
And then Newton responded and said, "Oh,
well, it costs too much. &nbsp;I mean, I'm not

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.670
a wealthy man, it would cost too much to summarize
this calculus that I've invented and to work

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.460
out all the motion of the stars." &nbsp;And then
Haley must have said this, he must have said,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:51.510
"Mr. Newton, I am a wealthy man. &nbsp;I have
made my fortune in commerce. &nbsp;I will pay

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:58.510
for the publication of the greatest scientific
work in any language." &nbsp;And it was Principia.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.550
The principals, the mathematical principals
that guide the heavens.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:12.500
Believe it or not, this is perhaps one of
the most important works ever written by a

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:19.500
human being in the 100,000 years since we
evolved from Africa. &nbsp;Realize that this book

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:27.460
sets into motion a physics of the universe.
&nbsp;Forces that control the motion of the planets,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:36.200
forces which can be calculated, forces which
govern the motion of cannonballs, rockets,

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:43.230
pebbles, everything that moves, moves according
to the laws of motion and the calculus of

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.360
Sir Isaac Newton.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.810
In fact, even today, when we launch our space
probes, we don't use Einstein's equations,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:55.940
they only apply when you get near the speed
of light or near a black hole. &nbsp;We use Newton's

00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:01.540
laws of gravity. &nbsp;They are so precise that
when we shoot a space probe right past the

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:08.540
rings of Saturn, we use exactly the same equations
that Isaac Newton unraveled in the 1600's.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.350
That's why we have glorious photographs
of the rings of Saturn. &nbsp;That's why we have

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:12.370
fly-by's right past Neptune. &nbsp;That's why
we've been able to unravel the secrets of

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:18.510
the solar system, compliments of the laws
of motion of Isaac Newton.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:24.660
So what Newton did was not only did he set
into motion the ability to calculate planets,

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:31.660
he also set into motion a mechanics. &nbsp;Machines
now operated upon well-defined laws:

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:40.090
Newton's three laws of motion. &nbsp;The first law of motion
says that objects in motion stay in motion

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:47.610
forever, unless acted on by an outside force.
&nbsp;You see that in an ice skating rink. &nbsp;You

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:53.790
should a puck and it goes all the way down
forever, unless acted upon by an outside force.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:14:00.580
That's different from Aristotle's law of
motion. &nbsp;Aristotle said, "Objects in motion

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.390
eventually stop, because they get tired."

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.980
The second law of motion says, force is mass
times acceleration. &nbsp;And that equation made

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:16.980
possible the Industrial Revolution. &nbsp;Steam
engines, locomotives, factories, machines,

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:25.290
all of it due to the mechanics set into motion
by Isaac Newton's second law of motion, force

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.570
is equal to mass times acceleration.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.090
And then Newton had a third law of motion.
&nbsp;For every action, there's an equal and opposite

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:37.420
reaction, that's the law of rockets. &nbsp;That's
why we have rockets that can sail into outer

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.320
space.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:38.860
which could have been calculated by Isaac
Newton himself.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:45.610
So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel
the first force of the universe, gravity,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:38.860
that number, 25,000 miles per hour, that's
the escape velocity of the earth, a number

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:45.610
So the lesson here is, when scientists unravel
the first force of the universe, gravity,

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:52.810
that set into motion the Industrial Revolution.
&nbsp;A revolution which toppled the kings and

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:59.810
queens of Europe, which displaced feudalism,
ushering in the modern age. &nbsp;All because

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:06.390
a 23-year-old gentleman looked up and asked
the question, "Does the moon also fall?"

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.600
You know, when I was a kid growing up in California,
I would see pictures of the Empire State Building.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.410
And I said to myself, "How could that possibly
build such a big building and not know that

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:24.100
it's going to fall? &nbsp;I mean, why doesn't
it fall? &nbsp;They didn't build scale models

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.730
of the thing, you couldn't have an Empire
State Building that big to test whether it's

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:33.500
going to fall or not. &nbsp;How did they know
ahead of time that that building wouldn't

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.510
fall? &nbsp;And the answer is: &nbsp;Newton's laws
of motion.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.610
In fact, today, I teach Newton's laws of motion,
and you can actually calculate the forces

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.820
on every single brick of the empire state
building, using

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.910
Newton's second law of motion, force is mass
times acceleration.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:57.120
When Newton unraveled
the force of gravity, that was the first force.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.760
Now, let's take a look at the
second force, an even greater force which

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.530
has touched all of our lives, and that is
the electromagnetic force.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:14.300
Ever since humans saw lightning bolts light
up the sky, ever since they were terrified

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:20.700
by the sound of thunder, they've been asking,
"Do the gods propel lightening bolts and create

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.820
thunder? &nbsp;Are they angry at us?"

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.830
Scientists began to
realize that the lightning bolts and the

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:34.210
thunder can be duplicated on the earth. &nbsp;That
we can actually create mini lightning bolts

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.120
using electricity.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:43.130
But it wasn't until the 1800's that finally
we begin to unlock the second great force

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.780
which rules the universe, the electromagnetic
force.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.980
Michael Faraday would give Christmas

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.810
lectures in London, fascinating everyone from
adults to children. &nbsp;And he would demonstrate

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.100
the incredible properties of electricity.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.220
Some people, for example, ask a simple question.
&nbsp;If you're in a car or an airplane, you get

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.980
hit by a lightening bolt, why don't you all
get electrocuted? &nbsp;Why don't you all die?

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.870
Well, Faraday answered the question. &nbsp;He
would create a cage.&nbsp;He would

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:19.339
walk into this steel cage, electrify it, and
he wouldn't get electrocuted at all. &nbsp;That's

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:25.019
called a Faraday cage and every time you walk
into &nbsp;metal structure, you get shielded by

00:17:25.019 --> 00:17:29.549
this metal object. Well, what Michael Faraday did was,

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:36.400
he helped to unleash the second great revolution
with something calls Faraday's Law.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.440
A moving wire in a magnetic
field, has this electrons pushed, creating

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.760
an electrical current.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.240
That simple idea unleashed the electric revolution.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.720
And that's why we have hydroelectric generators,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.920
dams that produce enormous amounts of power,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.760
That's why people build nuclear power plants. That's why we have electricity

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.280
in this room right now!

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.600
On a very small scale, you use that in your
bicycle. &nbsp;When you put a bicycle lamp on

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:15.230
your bicycle, the turning of the wheel spins
a magnet. &nbsp;The magnet then pushes electrons

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.289
in a wire and that's why electricity lights
up in your bicycle lamp.

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:21.309
So in other words,

00:18:21.309 --> 00:18:27.669
electricity and magnetism were unified into
a single force. &nbsp;We once thought that electricity

00:18:27.669 --> 00:18:34.669
and magnetism were separate. &nbsp;Now we know
they are in fact the same force.

00:18:35.259 --> 00:18:42.259
So if a moving magnet can create an electric
field, this means that a moving electric field

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:49.809
can create a magnetic field. &nbsp;But if they
can create each other, why can't they oscillate

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:56.789
and create a wave? &nbsp;So that moving electric
fields create magnetic fields, create electric

00:18:56.789 --> 00:19:00.759
fields, create magnetic fields, infinitum
to create a wave?

00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:06.019
Well, around the time of the American Civil
War, a mathematical physicist, James Clerk

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:11.440
Maxwell, calculated, using the work of Faraday,
the velocity of this wave.

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:17.740
And in one of the greatest breakthroughs
of all time, James Clerk Maxwell calculated

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:24.740
the velocity of this wave and found out it
was the velocity of light. &nbsp;And then he made

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:37.120
this incredible discovery: this is light.
&nbsp;That's what light is. &nbsp;It doesn't by accident

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.870
travel at the speed of electricity, it is
light itself.

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.659
wave, and that wave is called light.

00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:46.889
And the equations were written down by James
Clerk Maxwell. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Michael Faraday

00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:46.889
And the equations were written down by James
Clerk Maxwell. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Michael Faraday

00:19:46.889 --> 00:19:52.639
himself did not have a formal education. &nbsp;He
could not put into mathematical form his own

00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:58.350
work. &nbsp;James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical
physicist, just like myself. &nbsp;He wrote down

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:04.120
the mathematical physics of oscillating electric
fields and magnetic fields and they are called

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.799
Maxwell's equations. &nbsp;These equations have
to be memorized by every physicist in grad

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:15.659
school. &nbsp;You cannot get your PhD without
memorizing these equations. &nbsp;Every engineer

00:20:15.659 --> 00:20:19.330
deals with radar and radio has to memorize

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:24.419
these equations. &nbsp;And so, if you go to Berkley,
where I got my PhD, you can buy a t-shirt

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:31.419
which says, "In the beginning God said, the
four-dimensional divergence of an antisymmetric,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.070
second rank tensor equals zero, and there
was light.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:42.090
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is the equation for light.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
of light, we physicists today want to have
a one inch equation that summarize all physical

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
reality.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
Well, Michael Faraday in his own lifetime
was heralded as a great scientist, and how

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
many scientists do you know appear on money?
&nbsp;Well, there he is, on the British 20-pound

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
note. &nbsp;So it's very rare that a scientist
appears on a nation's currency, but so great

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
was a contribution of Michael Faraday that
there he is on the 20-pound note.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Electromagnetic Revolution&nbsp;and The Nuclear

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.580
Age

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:49.580
The consequences of the electromagnetic revolution
touch all of us. &nbsp;This is a picture of the

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.580
The consequences of the electromagnetic revolution
touch all of us. &nbsp;This is a picture of the

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:55.519
earth from outer space. &nbsp;Look at this picture.
&nbsp;Europe electrified, you can actually see

00:20:55.519 --> 00:21:02.509
the fruits of all of our efforts to create
electricity, to energize our lives, in one

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:08.879
picture, seeing the earth from outer space.
&nbsp;So let's now talk about how Faraday and

00:21:08.879 --> 00:21:12.889
Maxwell's work touches your life as well.

00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:16.919
This is the internet. &nbsp;The internet is a
simple byproduct of the electromagnetic force.

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:19.869
And
you can see that where there is the internet,

00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:25.649
there is prosperity. &nbsp;There is science, there's
entertainment, there's economic activity.

00:21:25.649 --> 00:21:32.110
Where there's no internet, there's poverty.
&nbsp;And in the future, the internet will be

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.779
miniaturized and it will be placed in your
glasses. &nbsp;Your glasses will recognize people's

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:42.950
faces and display their biography next to
the image as you talk to them, and then when

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:48.730
they speak Chinese to you, your glasses will
translate Chinese into English and print out

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:53.970
subtitles right beneath their image. &nbsp;So
in the future, you will know exactly who you

00:21:53.970 --> 00:22:00.720
are talking to without even talking to them,
and this means that at a cocktail party, if

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.720
you're looking for a job, but you don't know
who the heavy hitters are, in the future you

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.960
will know exactly who to suck up to.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.120
In the future, chips will only cost a penny, because we can manufacture tinier and tinier transistors

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.280
You will have Faraday's electromagnetic force inside your body

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.520
This is a pill. It has a chip in it. The chip is smaller than an aspirin pill,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.640
It also has a TV camera and a magnet.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.200
When you swallow it, the magnet guides the camera, taking pictures of your stomach,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.440
your intestines, because we all know what middle-aged men fear the most:

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.120
colonoscopies. And, this gives new meaning for the expression "intel inside."

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:52.160
Now, let's talk about the next great forces
which rule the universe. &nbsp;We talked about

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.640
gravity, which allows us to calculate the
motion of the planets. &nbsp;The mechanics created

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:03.520
by Newton helped to unleash the Industrial
Revolution. &nbsp;Michael Faraday worked out the

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.000
electromagnetic force, which gave us the wonders
of the electric age. &nbsp;And now, let's talk

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:18.600
about the nuclear age, the stars and the sun.
&nbsp;People have been fascinated by the sun,

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.000
Apollo was the god that strode across the
heavens in his fiery chariot. &nbsp;But hey, when

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.200
you calculate how long coal or oil will burn
like the sun, you realize that in just a few

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.900
hundred years, the sun would burn to a crisp.
&nbsp;So what could possibly last for billions

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.400
of years? &nbsp;There must be a new force, a nuclear
force.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.800
Einstein and others helped to unravel the
secret of the stars. &nbsp;The nuclear force comes

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:55.800
in two types, weak and strong. &nbsp;The weak nuclear force governs radioactive decay.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.900
The strong nuclear force is one of the strongest forces in the entire universe.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:08.000
It's so strong it holds our protons together, ever since Genesis, the beginning of time.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:16.320
The equation which allows for the liberation of energy is Einstein's famous equation E=mc².

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:22.240
What Einstein showed was that the faster you move, the heavier you get.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.280
So your weight is not a constant. When you move very rapidly you get heavier,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.800
something which we measure every day in the laboratory.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.200
Now, this means
that the energy of motion transformed into

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:44.480
mass, because you get heavier. &nbsp;Now, listen
carefully. &nbsp;The faster you move, the heavier

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.360
you get. &nbsp;Which means that the energy of
motion, "E" turns into "m", your mass. &nbsp;And

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.800
the relationship between E and m is very simple,
it takes one second to write it down on a

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.500
sheet of paper, it is exactly E=mc².

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:07.400
So the nuclear force helped to explain the
secret of the sun. &nbsp;But it also created a

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:15.300
Pandora's box, because inside the nucleus
of the atom, are particles. &nbsp;And when you

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:21.900
smash these particles, what do you get? &nbsp;More
particles. &nbsp;And when you smash them, what

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.020
More particles. In fact, we are drowning in subatomic particles. Hundreds,

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.840
thousands of subatomic particles every time
we smash atoms.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:37.260
Now, we smash atoms using something called atom smashers, or particle accelerators. I

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.040
built my own particle accelerator when I was in high school. When I was in high school,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:50.080
I went to my mom one day and I said, "Can
I have permission to build a 2.3 million electron

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:56.700
volt betatron particle accelerator in the
garage?" &nbsp;And my mom said, "Sure, why not?

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.500
And don't forget to take out the garbage!"

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.520
And as a high school kid I asked for 400 pounds of transformer steel.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.400
I asked for 22 miles of cooper wire.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.160
Because I wanted to create a six kilowatter, 10,000 gauss magnetic field,

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.840
to energize my atom smasher.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.720
With 22 miles of copper wire, how could you wind it?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.480
We did it on the high school football field. With 22 miles

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.840
of copper wire on the goalpost, gave it to my mother,

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.040
she ran to the 50 yard line unraveling the spool of wire, she gave it to my father

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.040
who then ran to the goalpost and we wound 22 miles of copper wire on the high school football field.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.640
Well, finally my atom smasher was ready.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.560
It consumed six kilowatts of power, that's every single ounce of power my house could deliver.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:51.920
I plugged my ears, I closed my eyes, I turned on the power, and I heard this huge crackling sound

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.680
as six kilowatts of power surged through my capacitor bank and then

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.640
I heard a "pop pop pop" sound as I blew out every single circuit breaker in the house.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.480
The whole house was plunged in darkness.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:12.720
My poor mom, every time she'd come home she'd see the lights flicker and die.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.840
And she must've wondered "why couldn't I have a son who plays baseball?"

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.800
Why can't he learn basket ball? And for god's sake why can't he find a nice Japanese girl?"

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.600
I mean, why does he have to build these machines in the garage?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.280
Well, these machines that I built in my garage earned the attention of a physicist

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.720
Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.080
And he arranged for me to get a scholarship to Harvard.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.040
And my career got a head start! He knew exactly what I was doing.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.040
I didn't have to explain to him that I was experimenting with antimatter.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.320
I was creating anti-electrons in my mom's garage, and using atom smashers to eventually create

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.920
beams of antimatter.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.360
Antimatter is the opposite of matter. It has an opposite charge.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:07.440
So an electron has negative charge. The positron, or anti-electron, has positive charge.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.080
This means that you can now create anti-molecules and anti-atoms.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.160
Anti-hydrogen was made at CERN, outside Geneva, Switzerland

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.720
And also at Fermilab outside Chicago

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.360
Where you have anti-electrons circulating around anti-protons.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.960
And in Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island just recently

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.040
they detected anti-helium!

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.680
We have two anti-protons with two anti-neutrons to create anti-helium.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.800
For every piece of matter there is a counterpart made out of anti-matter.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.640
And when the two collide, by the way, it releases the greatest energy source in the universe.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.560
It is 100 percent conversion of matter to energy by Einstein's equations E=mc squared.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:04.480
Inside the nucleus of the atom we have particles upon particles when you smash them apart.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.040
In the 1950's we were drowning in subatomic particles.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.960
In fact, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, once made a statement.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.040
He declared that "the Nobel Prize in physics should go to the physicist who does not discover

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.800
a new particle this year."

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.600
That how many particles were being discovered.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.680
So, let's talk about the Particle Zoo.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:38.560
Right now, we physicists have unlocked hundreds, thousands of subatomic particles.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.400
And we've been able to piece them together into a jigsaw puzzle.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.120
It's called the "standard model." It has 36 quarks, 19 free parameters, 3 generations of quarks

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:59.520
no rhyme, no reason, but this is the most fundamental basis of reality that we physicists

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:00.880
have been able to construct.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.880
Billions of dollars. 20 Nobel prizes.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.160
have gone into the creation of the standard model.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.440
and it is the ugliest theory known to science, but it works.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.480
There's one piece missing, and that one piece missing is called the Higgs-Boson.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.000
We expect to find it. We want to create a higher version of this theory

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.800
and that theory, we think, is string theory.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:35.840
String theory is based on the simple idea that all the four forces of the universe

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.920
Gravity, electromagnetic force, and the two nuclear forces, can be viewed as

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:42.960
music.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.560
Music of tiny little rubber bands.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.840
So if I had a super microscope, and I could look right into the heart of an electron

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.040
What would I see?

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.280
I would see a vibrating rubber band.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.680
And if I "twang" it, it turns into a neutrino.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.680
I "twang" it again and it turns into a quark.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.320
I "twang" it again and it turns into a Yang-Mills particle

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:09.120
In fact, if I "twang" it enough times, I get thousands of subatomic particles that have been cataloged

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.760
patiently by physicists.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.760
String theory, we think, is a theory of everything.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:23.520
Now, string theory, in turn, can be summarized in an equation about an inch long

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.520
That's my equation!

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.440
This is called string field theory. And how will we test it?

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.640
We are building a machine. The biggest machine of science ever built

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400
in the history of the human race.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.800
Outside Geneva, Switzerland.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:45.360
It is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:50.320
So the Higgs-Boson, we think, will be created by the Large Hadron Collider.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.560
A tube 17 miles in circumference with two beams of protons circulating in opposite directions

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.880
Then slamming together creating a shower of particles, and among these particles

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.000
we hope to find the Higgs-Boson, but not only that.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.360
We hope to find particles even beyond the Higgs-Boson.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.120
The next set of particles beyond the Higgs-Boson are "sparticles"

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.840
The next layer of the jigsaw puzzle are called sparticles—super particles

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.040
Nothing but higher vibrations, higher musical notes of a vibrating string.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.240
And what else can we do? We can also unlock secrets of the big bang.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.680
You see, Einstein's equations break down and the instant of the big band and the center of a black hole.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.800
The two most interesting places in the universe

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.000
are beyond our reach using Einstein's equations.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.600
We need a higher theory, and that's where string theory comes in.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.840
String theory takes you before the Big Bang, before Genesis itself.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.520
And what does string theory say? It says that there is a multiverse of universes.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.240
Where did the Big Bang come from?

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:12.480
Well, Einstein's equations give us this compelling picture that we are like insects on a soap bubble.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.760
A gigantic soap bubble which is expanding.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.880
and we are trapped like flies on fly paper, we can't escape the soap bubble

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.560
and that's called the Big Bang Theory.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.240
String theory says there should be other bubbles out there

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.800
in a multiverse of bubbles.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.080
When two universes collide it can form another universe.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:43.440
When a universe splits in half it can create two universes, and that, we think, is the Big Bang.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:52.960
The Big Bang is caused by either the collision of universes or by the fissioning of universes.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:00.560
If there are other dimensions, if there are other universes, can we go between universes?

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:06.960
Well that, of course, is very hard, but Alice in Wonderland gives us a possibility

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.640
that maybe one day we might create a wormhole between universes.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.680
This is a wormhole.

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.480
Think of taking a sheet of paper and putting two dots on it.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.480
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.800
But if I can fold, if I can fold that sheet of paper

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.160
Then perhaps I can create a shortcut.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.800
A shortcut through space and time, called a wormhole.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.240
This is a genuine solution of Einstein's equations.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.640
We can actually see this in string theory.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.600
The question is: how practical is it to go through one of these things?

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.200
We don't know. In fact there's a debate among physicists today, Stephen Hawking, many physicists

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.560
are jumping into the game of trying to figure out whether it's physically possible

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:01.840
to go all the way through a wormhole.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.560
Because if you could, then you might be able to use this as a time machine.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.680
Since string theory is a theory of everything, it's also a theory of time.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.840
And time machines are allowed in Einstein's equations, but to build one

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.400
is extremely difficult.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.680
Far more energy is required than a simple Delorean with plutonium.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.920
You know, trillions of years from now the universe is going to get awfully cold.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.880
We think the universe is headed for a big freeze.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.800
Stars will blink out, stars will cease to twinkle, and the universe will be so big

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.320
it'll be very cold.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.560
At that point all intelligent life in the universe must die.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:58.800
The laws of physics are a death warrant for all intelligent life.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:04.160
There is only one way to escape the death of the universe, and that is

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.400
leave the universe.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:11.760
We are now entering the realm of science fiction, but at least now we have equations

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.920
equations of string theory which will now allow us to calculate if

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.040
it is possible to go through a wormhole,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:24.560
to go to another universe where it's warmer, and perhaps we can start all over again.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.840
If you were to summarize the march of physics through the last 10,000 years

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.400
it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.720
Gravity, electricity and magnetism, and the two nuclear forces.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.440
But then the question is "is there a fifth force?"

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.840
A force beyond the forces we can measure in the laboratory.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:57.120
And believe it or not there are physicists who have looked very carefully for a fifth force.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.920
Some people think maybe it's psychic phenomena. Maybe it's telepathy.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.200
Maybe it's something called psi power. Maybe it's the power of the mind. Maybe consciousness!

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.640
Well, I'm a physicist.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:16.400
We believe in testing theories to make sure they are falsifiable and reproducible.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:22.560
We want to make sure that on demand your theory works every single time without exception.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.440
And if your theory fails one time,

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.240
It's wrong.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.320
In other words, Einstein's theory has to work every single time without exception.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.360
One time Einstein's theory is proven to be wrong, the whole theory is wrong.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.160
Well, so far we can reproduce these four physical theories, but a fifth theory cannot be reproduced.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:49.200
We've looked for it. Some people think that maybe a fifth force may be short range.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.120
Like, not over the nucleus of an atom, but ranging over several feet.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.440
And we can't find any.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:06.240
We physicists in the last ten years have discovered a new energy source larger than the galaxy itself.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.840
Dark energy.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.080
Realized in our universe today

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:17.360
73 percent of our universe, matter and energy, 73 percent is in the form of dark energy.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.800
The energy of nothing!

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:25.840
That's what's blowing the galaxies farther and farther apart. That's the energy of the Big Bang itself.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.000
Kids ask the question, "If the universe banged, what made it bang?"

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.080
And the answer is dark energy. 73 percent of the universe's energy is dark energy.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.240
23 percent is dark matter.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.560
Dark matter is invisible matter. If I held it in my hand it would go right through my hand.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.840
It holds the galaxy together. 23 percent of the universe is dark matter.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:52.480
Stars made out of hydrogen and helium make up four percent of the universe.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.720
And then what about us? We, the higher elements.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.280
We made out of oxygen, carben, nitrogen, tungsten, iron

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:06.560
We make up .03 percent of the universe.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:12.960
In other words, we are the exception. The universe is mainly made out of dark energy.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.080
The universe is mainly made out of dark matter.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.160
Overwhelming the stars, overwhelming the galaxies in fact.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.440
Now what is dark matter, which makes up 23 percent of the universe?

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:26.800
No one knows.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.520
String theory gives us a clue, but there's no definitive answer.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.400
So in other words, for you young aspiring physicists out there in the audience,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.880
You may be saying to yourself right now,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.320
"Why should I go into physics? Because you guys already have a candidate

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.000
for the unified field theory, right?

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.480
Just realize that every single physics textbook

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.760
is WRONG.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:56.720
Every single physics textbook on the Earth says that the universe is mainly made out of atoms

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.080
Right? There it is!

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.200
The universe is mainly made out of atoms. Wrong!

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:07.360
In the past ten years we have come to the realization that most of the universe is dark.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.640
And there's a whole shelf full of Nobel Prizes for the young people

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.040
who can figure out the secret of dark matter

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.640
and dark energy.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:25.840
Let me give some advice to you if you are a young physicist, perhaps just getting out of high school

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.720
You have dreams of being Einstein, you

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.680
have dreams of working on string theory and things like that

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.760
and then you hit freshman physics.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.440
Let me be blunt:

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.080
We physicists flunk most student taking elementary physics.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.600
And we're more or less encouraged to do so by the engineering department.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.840
We don't want to train engineers who make bridges that fall down.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.760
We don't want to create engineers that create skyscrapers that fall over.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.840
There's a bottom line: you have to know the laws of mechanics.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.080
So before you can work with the laws of Einstein,

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.640
you have to work with
the laws of friction, levers, pulleys and
gears.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.320
As a consequence we have a very high flunk-out rate in elementary physics.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.560
So if you're a young physicist graduating from high school with stars in your eyes,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.880
and you encounter freshman physics for the first time, watch out!

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.400
If you have a rough time, that's the way it is.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.160
I started out my life as an experimental physicist. Then I went to Harvard

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.360
and then I talked to my adviser, one of the world's greatest experiment physicists, Professor Pound

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.920
And he told me maybe it's time to give it a rest. He said to me,

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.640
"Your skills are much better suited to what you love the most, which is theory."

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.320
"Mathematics. The world of higher dimensions."

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.640
And I realized that he was probably right.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.920
The thing about physics, or science that really intrigues me the most

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.920
is to find the most fundamental basis for everything

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.080
Rather than trying to massage a theory, or make a theory prettier,

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.600
Why not find out why it works? What makes it tick?

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.720
And that's what I do for a living. I'm a theoretical physicist.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.160
Thank you very much!
