Department of Agriculture defines it as
 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.710
Department of Agriculture defines it as
and it defines it very precisely for

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720
and it defines it very precisely for
 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.609
and it defines it very precisely for
plants as no genetic engineering no

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619
plants as no genetic engineering no
 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.400
plants as no genetic engineering no
irradiation no fertilization with sewage

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410

those kinds of things it's very precise
 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.450
those kinds of things it's very precise
definition of what can and cannot go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
definition of what can and cannot go
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.630
definition of what can and cannot go
into a food that is called organic with

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640
into a food that is called organic with
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.270
into a food that is called organic with
that with animals the definition is also

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280
that with animals the definition is also
 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.640
that with animals the definition is also
quite precise the animals have to be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650
quite precise the animals have to be
 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.280
quite precise the animals have to be
raised on organic feed they have to have

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290
raised on organic feed they have to have
 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.770
raised on organic feed they have to have
access to the outdoors they can't be

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780
access to the outdoors they can't be
 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.990
access to the outdoors they can't be
treated with antibiotics or hormones and

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000
treated with antibiotics or hormones and
 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.680
treated with antibiotics or hormones and
so forth is the rules are very long and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
so forth is the rules are very long and
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.230
so forth is the rules are very long and
to the examples and the places that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240
to the examples and the places that
 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.170
to the examples and the places that
produce those organic animals or plants

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180
produce those organic animals or plants
 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.229
produce those organic animals or plants
are inspected to make sure that they're

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239
are inspected to make sure that they're
 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.749
are inspected to make sure that they're
following the rules so that's that

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759
following the rules so that's that
 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.870
following the rules so that's that
system and to the extent that it works

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880
system and to the extent that it works
 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.550
system and to the extent that it works
it works pretty well most people think

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560
it works pretty well most people think
 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.770
it works pretty well most people think
it works pretty well and there's not an

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780
it works pretty well and there's not an
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.899
it works pretty well and there's not an
enormous amount of cheating going on

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909
enormous amount of cheating going on
 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.209
enormous amount of cheating going on
because of the inspection system and

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219
because of the inspection system and
 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.050
because of the inspection system and
because the organic producers know what

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060
because the organic producers know what
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.520
because the organic producers know what
the other ones are doing and so they

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
the other ones are doing and so they
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.039
the other ones are doing and so they
turn each other in if there's a problem

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049
turn each other in if there's a problem
 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.050
turn each other in if there's a problem
there's not a lot of cheating going on

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060
there's not a lot of cheating going on
 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.599
there's not a lot of cheating going on
but with that said a lot of people feel

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609
but with that said a lot of people feel
 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.459
but with that said a lot of people feel
that the organic rules are not strong

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469
that the organic rules are not strong
 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.830
that the organic rules are not strong
enough that they really don't deal in

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840
enough that they really don't deal in
 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.919
enough that they really don't deal in
particular with the ability of animals

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929
particular with the ability of animals
 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.410
particular with the ability of animals
to be outdoors just because they have

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420
to be outdoors just because they have
 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.169
to be outdoors just because they have
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they
 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.719
access to the outdoors doesn't mean they
are actually afterwards that's a big

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729
are actually afterwards that's a big
 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.539
are actually afterwards that's a big
loophole and also there's no requirement

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549
loophole and also there's no requirement
 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.569
loophole and also there's no requirement
for sustainability so you can have

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579
for sustainability so you can have
 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.779
for sustainability so you can have
industrial organic agriculture that is

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789
industrial organic agriculture that is
 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.569
industrial organic agriculture that is
just as devastating to land sea and air

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579
just as devastating to land sea and air
 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.949
just as devastating to land sea and air
and climate as industrial anything else

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959
and climate as industrial anything else
 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.080
and climate as industrial anything else
and that's I think a problem i think the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090
and that's I think a problem i think the
 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.120
and that's I think a problem i think the
department of agriculture is looking at

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130
department of agriculture is looking at
 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.090
department of agriculture is looking at
ways to strengthen the organic rules and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
ways to strengthen the organic rules and
 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.340
ways to strengthen the organic rules and
ways to make sure that they're kept

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350
ways to make sure that they're kept
 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.010
ways to make sure that they're kept
honest
