00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.250
I’m really interested in this question and
I’m glad you asked about it.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.370
This is a question of how do Americans value
life?

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.590
Is every life equally valuable to an American?

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.980
I would argue it’s not, and there’s some
evidence of that.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.800
We know precisely how many Americans have
been killed in uniform since 9/11.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.130
We know the number – there’s a website
that will tell you tomorrow what the number

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.770
is to the last to man.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.430
But tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds
of thousands of Iraqis, Afghans, Yemenis,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.050
Somalis have died, not always at our hands,
often in internecine warfare, but we can hardly

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.050
count.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.840
And the American people hardly care exactly
how many civilians died in the last drone

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.250
strike or exactly how many Iraqis died in
the course of the civil war.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.489
It seems that the American people are completely
disjointed from this war.

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.540
If they take a moment to think on it, it’s
just enough to wave a flag, stick a bumper

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.190
sticker on their car with a yellow ribbon,
maybe stand for the pledge and clap for the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.560
latest service member on the field in the
NFL.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.700
Most Americans aren’t paying any attention
to the military.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.970
And I’ll say I think one reason why this
is, one part is race.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.900
There’s no denying it.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.650
This is very uncomfortable for people to deal
with, but we fight brown people.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.800
Usually we fight Arabs, we fight Pashto in
Afghanistan and other ethnic groups.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.619
These people don’t necessarily look like
the traditional American, and so their lives

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.750
have less value.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.530
How do we know this?

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.119
When there was a terrorist attack in Belgium
and, say, 20 people are killed, well those

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.790
are Europeans; they kind of look like Americans.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.900
It’s days of coverage.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.040
Every single individual face is on the screen
even if they’re not American citizens.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
Every Caucasian face is accounted for when
there’s a terrorist attack, and it’s the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.460
narrative or for days, which is hard to do
in this news cycle.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.040
But what about the next day, when 140 people
are killed in Turkey in a terrorist attack,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.020
also perpetrated by ISIS, also perpetrated
on innocent people?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.409
We will never see the faces of those Turks.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.920
We might not even get the exact number.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.470
They’ll say, “Approximately 140 people
were killed in an attack,” and it’s going

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.470
to be on the Chyron.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.540
And so I think we have to ask ourselves a
question, which is: if America is truly to

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.200
be engaged around the world, as we are, with
hundreds of military bases abroad—we’re

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.230
the only people who do this by the way—if
we are to be so engaged in the world then

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.599
I can’t help but wonder if we ought to be
more sensitive to the value of life in the

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.650
regions of which we are either occupiers,
invaders, or humanitarians, depending on your

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.650
point of view.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.840
I’m not even going to necessarily weigh
in on that, I think it’s a little bit of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.810
both or a little of all.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.591
But I think you bring up a great question,
which is: American lives clearly matter, but

00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:49.150
if we truly believe that all lives matter,
we sure don’t act like it in the media space.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.080
And that disturbs someone like me who grew
to love Iraqis and Afghanis, especially Iraqis,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.350
who were the first people that I really dealt
with in uniform.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.350
And I fell in love with these people.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.720
Because you know what most of them want to
do?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.819
They want to wake up; they want to go to work;
they want to take care of a family.

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.819
And they’re innocent.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.470
They’re as innocent and as valuable as we
are as Americans, and we’re in their countries.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.709
We are guests, often uninvited guests, but
we are guests.

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.680
And I think it’s really important to value
life there.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.409
I don’t think we do enough of it at home—or
abroad.
