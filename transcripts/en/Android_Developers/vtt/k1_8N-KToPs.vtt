00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Hi there and welcome to The App
Clinic.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.170
I am Dr. Reto Meier.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.889
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I'm Dr. Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We are not real doctors.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But we are qualified to operate
on Android Apps in several states in US territories.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The App Clinic is our weekly opportunity
to take a look at some great Android Apps

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.900
and talk a little about what we can do to
make them even better.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560
So, today, we're looking at travel planning
and booking apps.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.510
I think the idea is, we got the holidays coming
up.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.240
We all go somewhere to get away from our families.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.240
Absolutely.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.399
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, let's take a look at the
apps that'll help us plan that.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.399
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.550
So, we have a number of apps that we're going
to have to look at today.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.949
Weíre going to start with Worldscope Webcams
4.0.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.850
We've also got Kayak, Hipmunk and TripAdvisor.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.370
So, the idea here is they're all apps which
are going to help you to plan your trip, to

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.859
make the bookings for your trip rather than
apps which are going to help you while you

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:56.969
are on holidays.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.969
We are going to look at those later.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.969
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.699
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We have some great suggestions in
the moderator cue for those apps.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.799
Rest assured that we will be checking them
out as well.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think we're going to start
with Worldscope Webcamera which is a little

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.570
bit of a twist on what we wanted to see, you
know.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.300
We were thinking more of planning and booking
in terms of as Kayak or Expedia, that sort

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.530
of service.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.820
But this one has an interesting twist.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.890
What Worldscope Webcams does is it let's you
check out your destination before you go.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: How nice.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it'll let you look at webcams
pretty much anywhere.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.430
So, no worries.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.000
No worries.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.860
It's cool.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.009
We were on a streak there.

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: A streak of what?

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: One day without an accident.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.540
And just reset that to zero now.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes, it's such a nice intro animation
there.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.659
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it is.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.770
Well, thank you.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:56.009
So, what Worldscope does is it let's you take
a look at different webcams across the world

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.159
and see what's going on.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.469
So, for instance, here's a Kolonaki where
I used to live.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.469
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's nice.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.469
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: St. Dagma Square.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.979
I was hoping we don't catch a riot, you know,
no such luck.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.979
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, that's a shame.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:06.979
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.979
They seemed to be doing all right.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.890
A lot of these webcams just refresh every
few minutes, every hour.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.600
Some of them refresh much more frequently
than that but you can at least get an idea

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.450
of what's happening where you want to go.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's nice.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Like, you sort of one up on Google
street view...

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...in a way.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.990
You're able to add to favorites with a star.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice one.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're able to refresh the webcam
and there's a huge list of options.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.890
That's so nice.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: My favorite of course is to show
on map because what I'm really asking is how

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.290
close is this webcam to my hotel?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We've already been burned that
work, right.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.200
So, let's take a look show on the map.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, you're using a--open street
maps.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.100
Nice.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They certainly are.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, it's interesting.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a little bit rough mostly
because I can see where we are on the map,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.381
but that doesn't really help me.

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:01.381
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, no.

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:02.381
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.381
And if I...

00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:04.381
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's not--it's not necessarily as
specific as you'd like it to be.

00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:05.381
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.530
If I'd zoom in, yeah.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.100
So, but in general, you know, you can...

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, Perth.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.100
Nice.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.100
It's show really nice.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This is my old hometown.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah, Hillarys Boat Harbour.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.130
They've only a black and white...

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Obviously.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...webcam but that's cool.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It seems they had video.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They had an audio only before
and now they're down all the way up to the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
50s.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.760
You know I thought that we're using a semaphore
flags to explain what the current temperature

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.110
and conditions were like.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, that's how their TCP connection
is.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Of course, that makes sense.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's a physical link for these
guys.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.580
Yeah.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's TCP over some report.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.580
All right.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.580
So, yeah, a very interesting little app.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that's right.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Not--you know obviously it does
help you in the travel planning processing

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680
any more than this.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But not a bad idea.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.290
It would be interesting to see features like
this integrated into other apps or indeed

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.750
using intense to allow you to view the webcams
of areas around the hotels you want to book.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.340
So maybe an opportunity for some of the other
apps that we're looking at today to link in

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.340
to an app like this.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.340
All right.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.340
Let's go ahead and move on.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.340
So, the next step we wanted to look at was
Hipmunk.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Have you...

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what...

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.434
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Have you ever checked this one out
before?

00:04:10.434 --> 00:04:11.434
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I checked this one out, yeah.

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.434
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Did you have a look at the first
few [INDISTINCT] didn't you?

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I did actually and then we didn't--we
arranged them into an order that would make

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960
sense.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.960
And then we're able to...

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.769
You know that's because, you know, all that
cool movies, growing stuff, that takes time.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That took a long time, so long
we don't even have a script for this.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.199
If I was reading off the teleprompter now,
I'd be saying, "Hello everyone.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.260
My name is Reto Meier.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.710
And welcome to this weekend Android Development."

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.980
I totally want to get that as a clip.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:33.980
Okay.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.980
So, Hipmunk.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.980
Hipmunk is more of an all-in-one.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:36.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, Hipmunk fully disclosure,
we're friends with the guys that made this

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.370
software.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: At least one of them used to
work here.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Who was that?

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They're really cool little piece
of software.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:52.260
Unfortunately, it isn't going to help us a
lot where we are right now which is--let's

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.630
see, 77 Saint Georges Terrace and Harris in
Perth.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, nice.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.960
I have a friend of mine who has a new bar
and restaurant in exactly that location.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is it--is it Lala Rick?

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It might be.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's great.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.590
So, what Hipmunk does is let's you...

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It does?

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'll just back out here.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So this is the first--the first
page of Hipmunk.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.090
It's a dashboard with two items that's trying
not to be a dashboard.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.090
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.219
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I can either do a hotel search
here.

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's trying very hard to be a list
rather than a dashboard.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.740
Hotel search or flight search.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.840
Now, the truth is I'm going to find any hotels
in Perth.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840
They just don't exist.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Is that right?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, you know, if I--let's say
that I'm planning a trip.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And this is actually one thing
that I found a little odd.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.320
I felt like the first thing I wanted in an
application like this was not to actually

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320
see my location.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.900
But, you know, let's--weíll go over that
a little bit more.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.000
So, let's--the trip that I want to take is
to Venice.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Oh, not...

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.419
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Venice, Florida?

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...Venice, Florida.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860
Venice, Italy.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.860
Yeah.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.860
Yeah.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It didn't seem to work.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.100
Let's--I give up.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.670
Let's go to Venice, Florida or Valencia of
Venezuela.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.670
Apparently...

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:06.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's pretty much the same thing.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know when I travel I'm easy.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.320
Okay.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.950
Now, it's got a little progress bar down there.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.100
And notice it's filling in all the hotels
that I can find that fit my definition of

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.100
what I wanted.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And you can filter using the
settings.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:28.400
Log in and you can get a heat map to let you
know what's good and bad in terms of price.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.290
You can also do a flight search.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.340
And their flight search that's apparently--okay,
Perth to Honolulu.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.340
That is perfect.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.680
We'll go ahead and do that.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.310
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's a really cheap flight too.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.310
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, apparently.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Awesome.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.310
All right.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.600
They do take awhile but I hope we can get
to this screen in a reasonable amount of time

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.780
because they have probably the best flight
search screen I've ever seen.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, there you go.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.880
So...

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Look at them.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they allow you to search by
different categories, you know, price and

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.960
when you depart and when you arrive but it
also let you sort by this thing called agony.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.860
I think that's the coolest thing in the world.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's nice.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a combination of the departure
and arrival time, the total time of the flight,

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.330
how bad your seat is and a bunch of other
things.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.060
And, it also let's you see...

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, you can zoom in the...

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...on the calendar.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.830
Yeah.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, the nice thing--I think
we don't have it set up here but we--this

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.570
will actually integrate with your calendar.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.910
So, if you have events...

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.479
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you know, for instance...

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:34.660
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You can see whether you're going
to make it there in time and make sure that

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.180
you leave after a reasonable period after
your last meeting.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.430
Like, for instance, it might say, "Oh here,
we've got the, you know, Android Developers

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.430
weekly."

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I would say, "Well, I don't
care about that."

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.100
So, you know we're at and there we go.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.020
And also, it color codes the airlines but
I haven't figure it out yet.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:52.020
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.039
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I was hoping at first that it
would be frequent flight per hour.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.039
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:56.039
Always.

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:57.039
Yeah.

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.039
Yeah.

00:07:58.039 --> 00:07:59.039
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.039
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's nice.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.039
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's not...

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.039
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it's actually based on the
color scheme of the airline because Cathay

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:05.400
Pacific is that olive green, Emirates is that
sort of red color, so that could be it.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
Japan Airlines, I don't know if they're gray.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400
I don't know.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It looks like it could be basing
on something like that.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.900
Anyway just a really cool thing.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.900
It also...

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's great.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...marks your flights as to whether
they have Wifi or not and couple of other

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.599
convenient little things.

00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:22.599
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:23.599
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, that's cool.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:25.900
All right.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.389
Let's go ahead and move on and quickly go
over Kayak.

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:40.139
So, Kayak is one of a family of apps that--I
think are really decided gateway to the web

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:41.139
service.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:42.139
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:43.139
Yeah.

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They're all very similar but
I think it's pretty well done.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.579
You have the opportunity to search for hotels
and, you know, check in with your check in

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.029
and check out time.

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:59.599
You can search your flights and you can also
search any number of other things...

00:08:59.599 --> 00:09:01.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.029
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...including your airport information,
not seat information.

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:07.620
I'm surprised about that...

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.620
That's unfortunate.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...or I might've just missed
it.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You shouldn't.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But also, you can even do you
packing list here.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, nice.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:17.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, sort of the...

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.021
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, sort of the full service model
of traveling and booking plan.

00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.021
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:09:20.021 --> 00:09:21.021
It's an all-in-one flight planner.

00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.021
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:25.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And also, let's take a look at
the apps that you looked at Reto.

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:26.089
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:28.629
I looked at a couple this morning when I wasn't
messing around in the clinic.

00:09:28.629 --> 00:09:29.629
There's two apps.

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:31.269
One, is a FastBooking and the other TripAdvisor.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:35.269
So, we're going to have to look at FastBooking
first which is this app here.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:36.700
So, I can hit the icon.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:43.250
So, this is a sort of based primary around
just the booking part of the app.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.550
And much like, you know, most of the other
apps we're looking at--you know you have that

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.610
ability to, you know, basically be able to
specify your details and find out if there

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.610
are hotels available.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.660
So, this is actually available in the US.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:55.679
It's a European app.

00:09:55.679 --> 00:09:56.679
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But I thought, you know, why not
have a look.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.819
So, one of the things which struck me immediately
upon looking at this app is that you sort

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:07.730
of end up straight in this page where you're,
you know, ready to book your hotels.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.899
There's no real--you know there's no additional
features, there's no flights.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:12.279
It's really just hotel bookings.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:18.100
If we search around May, I'm going to suspect
that its not going to work so I'm going to

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.559
put in--let's put in Venice because, we know,
we got to go there last time.

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:22.559
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:23.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And search.

00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:28.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know what's odd I have occasions
only wanted exactly this.

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:31.559
Just something that we take to my current
location and tell me what hotel we're going

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.559
to route.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which one escaped, yeah.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:38.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But that was only when I was
like backpacking around the world that calls

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.980
you--I mean you really got to be in an odd
position...

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, to...

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...to want to use that feature.

00:10:43.139 --> 00:10:46.589
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, you know, that being said
its not--it's not the most ridiculous.

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:51.660
You know, I know that there has been in occasions
in my past where I haven's had a backpack,

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.259
but had still been looking for somewhere.

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:54.259
Sort of last minute.

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:55.259
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:59.260
Absolutely, you know, when you--when you read
the current heat row and decide to drive up

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.019
to Scotland to visit distilleries.

00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:04.032
Whenever you're tired you want to find out...

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.032
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You want to just find...

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.032
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...where the nearest hotel is.

00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:07.032
Absolutely.

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:08.032
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...something near by.

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:11.019
Exactly, so you go through and it's got the
usual things that you'd expect from a hotel

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:12.019
booking app.

00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:14.149
You got descriptions, star ratings.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:16.700
Find out about the rooms, galleries reviews.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.699
All those sort of things, so itís a fully
featured hotel booking app, but doesn't really

00:11:20.699 --> 00:11:22.240
go beyond that.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.899
It certainly has really nice hotel booking
features--I mean...

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:27.899
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, absolutely.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:28.899
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I donít think any other app
have these galleries.

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:29.899
I guess it's really...

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:30.899
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:31.899
This is very true.

00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.939
They're really--you know, gone that extra
step I think to make sure that you can see

00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:35.459
exactly what is you are going to be getting.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:39.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, Rachel and I have travel
a lot, right--I mean, well you've--we've been

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.110
around the world.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.970
I--and I've done a lot of booking.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:47.119
And mostly on websites and it will say I usually
have three or four tabs open.

00:11:47.119 --> 00:11:51.990
One is for the flights to try and figure out
what the best times are.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.209
Maybe airlines to figure out which alliance
they belong to or how many miles I'm going

00:11:57.209 --> 00:11:58.209
to get.

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:01.699
I'll probably have seat SeatGuru opened, so
I can see, you know, if I'm getting a seat

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:03.559
near the bathroom or not.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:09.139
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I'll also have the individual
hotel pages open to try and find out what

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:15.740
their rooms are like, what their policies
are like, so to me an all in one travel app

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.740
will be Godsend.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.519
Absolutely and we have to do this a lot.

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:22.480
And often when are traveling it's for some
industry conference.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: CES and Google Congress and so,
you know, you really--in this situation when

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.279
there aren't a lot of rooms.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:31.358
A lot of people are coming at the same time
and you--having to do this for work, so its

00:12:31.358 --> 00:12:32.358
not pleasure.

00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:33.920
You are not trying to--you know, you are not
enjoying the process of finding a place to

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920
stay.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920
You just...

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.269
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...have all the information in one
place and make sure its going to be as pleasant

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:40.239
as you can it be.

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:42.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.119
We actually came up with some prescriptions
for a good travel app but before we get to

00:12:46.119 --> 00:12:47.769
them lets take a look to our last app.

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:51.459
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, we got one more app to look
at which is Trip it--oh, sorry.

00:12:51.459 --> 00:12:52.459
Not trip it.

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:53.459
TripAdvisor.

00:12:53.459 --> 00:12:54.459
I like...

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:55.459
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:56.459
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...any app which has trip at the
beginning of it.

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:57.459
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:12:57.459 --> 00:12:58.459
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, TripAdvisor is--TripAdvisor
is great.

00:12:58.459 --> 00:13:03.870
So, I use this website a lot and my wife specially
uses it a lot to help plan our holidays.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.619
And so this is getting a little closer to
this full service model.

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:12.140
You can see here that we've got hotels, restaurants,
things to do, flight's, [INDISTINCT] the whole

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.140
sort of things.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.060
So, even you know, from booking the hotels
to begin with before you start your travel.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.050
Let's go with current location.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.220
I think that what it does by default.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.670
So, now this is something that I did want
to--did want to talk about really briefly.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.269
It really wants me to write the app.

00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:30.480
I hate--I hate this.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.699
I hate this feature.

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:34.389
I hate people telling me, you know, please
validate me.

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:35.699
Tell me how awesome I am.

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:38.319
If I like the app I will go and give it a
good review.

00:13:38.319 --> 00:13:39.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.319
I think it's...

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.319
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This make me want to give it a bad...

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:42.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It feels a little desperate...

00:13:42.319 --> 00:13:43.439
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Really it does.

00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:46.679
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...but you know, honestly I think
that we may feel that way just because we

00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:47.679
look at so many apps.

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:51.029
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I guess but--I mean, its--to me
it's breaking the magic, right?

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:52.029
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:13:52.029 --> 00:13:53.649
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, it's like we've talk about this
a lot.

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:56.800
And sort of app that I want to use doesn't
make me think about the fact that it's not

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
an app, you know.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.529
Its just going to be a part of the phone something
that I'm always going to have installed in

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:01.529
any device that I have.

00:14:01.529 --> 00:14:02.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:03.529
It's true.

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:05.699
I don't think you'd ever get into you Bentley
and have your Bentley say, "Hey.

00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:07.569
Do you like driving this car?"

00:14:07.569 --> 00:14:09.869
Maybe you like to talk about it on Facebook."

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:11.779
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Tell your friends how much you love
driving your Bentley.

00:14:11.779 --> 00:14:12.779
Itís a little desperate.

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:13.909
Itís a little needy and in this...

00:14:13.909 --> 00:14:14.909
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:18.369
&gt;&gt; MEIER: In this app in particular if I hit
back now then--okay, it's gone.

00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:22.989
It knows that I say no but actually you'll
find that as we continue to navigate through

00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:25.480
it is going to pop up again and again.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is, you know, I'm switching.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.680
I think the only way that I've been happy
with that is if I see that as a single menu

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.009
option in the overflow.

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:36.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:37.009
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, oh, yeah right.

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:39.029
I was going to rate that app, okay.

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:44.319
You know and for some reason I am completely
clueless about how to launch Google Play.

00:14:44.319 --> 00:14:47.249
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I installed the app in Google Play.

00:14:47.249 --> 00:14:50.769
And used the reviews to decide whether I wanted
it but I still can't figure out how to review

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:51.769
it.

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:52.769
Okay, then itís a useful thing.

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:53.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:54.769
Sure.

00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:55.769
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But we will stop beating on that
horse.

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:58.509
So, the real key here is that it has all of
the TripAdvisor stuff in here.

00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:02.399
So, it's got huge number of traveler reviews
and these are really valuable reviews which

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:06.320
a lot of people put a lot of time and effort
into, you know, providing that information.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.089
There's photos from the--from people who've
actually stayed in these places.

00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:14.819
All done with nice--you know, clear pages
so you can see exactly what you are looking

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:15.819
at.

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:16.819
It's quite nice.

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:21.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Although we can't really rate
the content so much when we are talking about

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.589
the Android App because a lot of great services
exist on the web.

00:15:25.589 --> 00:15:26.589
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:15:26.589 --> 00:15:27.589
That is true.

00:15:27.589 --> 00:15:30.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And not all of them have great
Android Apps to go along with that...

00:15:30.449 --> 00:15:31.449
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:32.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...great content.

00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:33.449
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:34.449
No, absolutely.

00:15:34.449 --> 00:15:35.509
And then this is a really good example of
tying to take something what you already have

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:39.879
this great content and leveraging on what
it is really rapidly becoming the way that

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:41.119
people access their information.

00:15:41.119 --> 00:15:44.920
And I think the things that I travel specially
so, because you can seat in your couch with

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.920
your Nexus 7 and flick through all these hotels.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.549
It can be a nice experience.

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:54.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely--I mean, the one thing
that strikes me immediately when I look this

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:55.089
app is, "Wow.

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:58.889
I think everyone on the design team is probably
carrying a phone by a different manufacturer."

00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:00.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:01.739
That definitely does seem to be the case.

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:05.569
And will go into a little more detail about
the specifics around some of the designs issues

00:16:05.569 --> 00:16:09.509
but you can straight away see, you know, we've
got these kind of weird looking tabs, the

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:10.509
two small buttons here.

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:16.300
We got the action bar which is nice but then
we are not using sort of standard [INDISTINCT]

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.160
just to control the navigation but...

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: [INDISTINCT] levels.

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:23.259
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT] I like its--again we
happened to be in my hometown of Perth at

00:16:23.259 --> 00:16:27.769
the number six attraction and the best recommendation
here is the Swan River.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:29.619
Itís a river.

00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:30.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I like rivers.

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:35.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Rivers are great and [INDISTINCT]
but I guess that's number 97 but anyway I

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.259
do [INDISTINCT] so, we got things to see,
places to eat, places to stay.

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:44.120
All sort of put that--put there for you to
observe which is nice.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.970
You know, its give you that ability to be
able to create your entire trip all in one

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:49.970
place.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.970
Cool.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.970
Nice.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.129
So, those are the apps that we are looking
at today.

00:16:54.129 --> 00:16:55.589
Let's go in a little deeper.

00:16:55.589 --> 00:16:56.589
Open them up and...

00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:57.589
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:16:57.589 --> 00:16:58.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...see what's going on.

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:00.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's really get in there and perform
a clinic.

00:17:00.939 --> 00:17:01.939
So...

00:17:01.939 --> 00:17:02.939
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's great.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:04.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We've put together some prescriptions
and I know you spent a little bit more time

00:17:04.939 --> 00:17:06.610
with the apps this week than I have Ian.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:11.260
So, why don't you tell the folks what does
it take to make a great travel booking and

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.260
planning app?

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, first as always you need
to be consistent with the Android design guide.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:20.209
Why is that important because we want to have
a consistent experience and users always know

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:22.319
how to do what they want to do.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.949
Now remember last week we talked about camera
apps and we said that they should be pretty

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.419
and consistent.

00:17:28.419 --> 00:17:32.250
In this case of course you want it to be pretty
but they don't need to be artistic.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:38.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: More than anything else they
need to be useful and consistent and probably

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.610
also branded.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.630
You want to make sure people know what they
are using and I think one thing which is consistent

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.600
here, you know, we are talking about particularly
when it comes to hotels and tourist attractions

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.920
to make good use of photos.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.139
You know, that's really was going to sell
people on the destinations is being able to

00:17:53.139 --> 00:17:54.139
see that.

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:56.570
So, we want to see nice big rich images.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:57.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.179
Now travel app just need to be location aware.

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.179
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:03.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Most apps do but certainly--no,
when you're--when you are traveling obviously

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.770
you are almost always going to be starting
from your current location somewhere you like.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.040
It should integrate with my digital life and
I can't over emphasize this.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.250
This is really, really important to me.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:23.610
I want to make sure that the tools that I
used to keep track of my life like calendar,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:33.860
like Google+ or Facebook or Twitter are integrated
into this tool so that my travel plans and

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.110
my real life--my regular life can fit together.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:42.500
And, you know, I mean maybe this is just me,
but I'm honestly sometimes forgotten that

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.210
I was going to go to China until the last
minute.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.999
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Wait, is that today?

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:48.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:49.999
Its like I would literally make plans.

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:52.090
Like, oh yeah, I can totally go out with you
on Tuesday night.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.200
Oh, yeah, I'm going to be in China.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.440
We want something to plans your trip.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.479
A trip is not just a flight.

00:19:01.479 --> 00:19:02.479
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:19:02.479 --> 00:19:03.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a flight, a hotel.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.720
It's transportation through and from the hotel.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.720
It's...

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The things to do...

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Random tourist [INDISTINCT] that
my wife likes and finally we want something

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:20.120
that's gong to let me do the entire set of
transaction by everything related at a trip

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120
on the device.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.210
I don't want to have to go to a website.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I definitely don't want to pop
up a browser window if possible.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:27.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.779
And I don't want to have to save something
and then look into my account on a computer

00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:31.779
to be able to complete things.

00:19:31.779 --> 00:19:34.670
You know, I just want to be able to do everything
right from whatever device I'm using.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, let's keep those in mind
to take a look at some of this apps.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.120
And while we do that I want to remind folks
that we have produce a [INDISTINCT].

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.970
Keeping an eye on our YouTube and Google+
events.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.539
So, if you have any questions or comments
about the apps that we are looking at maybe

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:53.049
ways in which, you know--what are the prescriptions
you guys think it takes to make a great app?

00:19:53.049 --> 00:19:56.690
Do let us know and we will try and answer
those questions as well.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.690
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.520
Producers Scott, do we have anything interesting
on the comments stream right now?

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.739
&gt;&gt; I'm not seeing a whole lot of interaction.

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:06.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Shame on you.

00:20:06.779 --> 00:20:08.600
Shame on you viewers.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.610
Talk to producer Scott.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.610
He's lonely.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:11.649
&gt;&gt; MEIER: He's very lonely.

00:20:11.649 --> 00:20:13.100
He's just checking his email.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.180
His got this frown on his face.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.180
I really don't know what you guys are talking
about.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's hard to be Scott.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.440
He just moved down here from Seattle and the
sun is killing him.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's foggy and overcast in Mountain
View today, but even still.

00:20:25.309 --> 00:20:28.020
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Even still the son is killing
him.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.580
And this doesnít look like September.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.600
It looks like late July.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.600
All right.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's put some...

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's go ahead and take a look
at.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.280
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's do that.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280
Yeah.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.799
Take a little deeper look at starting with
Worldscope.

00:20:39.799 --> 00:20:41.679
Now, this is going to be a quick one because...

00:20:41.679 --> 00:20:42.679
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:20:42.679 --> 00:20:43.679
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's not lot to this app.

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:44.679
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:20:44.679 --> 00:20:50.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But I did have some issues with
not just our prescription for a travel app

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.859
which don't necessarily apply to this particular
app.

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:53.859
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Cool.

00:20:53.859 --> 00:21:02.179
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But with the UI the first problem
that I had is that this area here it looks

00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:03.299
like a view pager, right?

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:04.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It does.

00:21:04.299 --> 00:21:05.640
Yeah, you should be able to fling that around.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.679
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:07.730
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: However, this is.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.580
So you've got the tabs...

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, okay.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.590
So, the tabs are most likeable.

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:20.720
Now, I think they may have done that because
when you get to the map which is zoomed way,

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.730
way out.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Way out.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a little bit difficult to
operate the size of view page and that's understandable

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.780
but...

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:29.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The view size.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...I don't feel like that's necessarily
an excuse for making it completely broken

00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:34.269
everywhere else.

00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:35.269
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:38.090
I mean there are ways that you can sort of
do an edge swipe as well so you can still

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.770
have a view page a type functionality while
you still got a full screen, a multi-pen...

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:43.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:44.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know.

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:51.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It also bothered me that the
search tab doesn't actually search.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:52.590
It's just the map view.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.529
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, so it's more browse like browse
file.

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:55.529
Well, it's just browse.

00:21:55.529 --> 00:21:56.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:21:56.529 --> 00:21:57.529
And then I have to do...

00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:58.529
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Get search.

00:21:58.529 --> 00:21:59.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I have to actually.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:01.563
Now, they are doing the regular search bar
in the action bar so that's very, very nice.

00:22:01.563 --> 00:22:02.563
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:22:02.563 --> 00:22:05.500
They've done that the nice--the right way
which is nice to see and you got your appropriate

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.169
app for [INDISTINCT] instead to escape out
of it which is nice to see.

00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:13.530
You can see here--one thing that I noticed
was that we're actually cutting of the name

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.940
of the app while were in portrait mode.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.770
So it seems like this might be an opportunity
to drop the name completely and just stick

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.450
with the logo rather than having in abbreviated
name which just kind of makes it look squished.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.880
You also might give some serious thought to
completely getting rid of these tabs and making

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.059
those a navigation drop down.

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:38.850
So, obviously you've decided that you don't
want view put-- view page activities and if

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:45.309
you don't want to view pager then being able
to just tap on the app icon, have a drop down

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:46.309
navigation...

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:47.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:50.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...is going to be just as fast,
pretty much just discoverable and you get

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.340
the screen really [INDISTINCT].

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.500
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And if I'm not mistaken I believe
that if you actually use the standard action

00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.520
bar tabs it will switch between having a drop
navigation in portrait mode and if you've

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.370
got space, so at landscape mode or on tablets
it actually switched to a tab layout instead.

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Very nice.

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:06.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Get it for free.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that would be very cool.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:14.169
And I mentioned before to that once you're
on this map zooming in is not particularly

00:23:14.169 --> 00:23:15.169
efficient.

00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:16.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:23:16.169 --> 00:23:20.340
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And if you already know where
you want to go being able to zoom in on the

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.340
specific location that you wanted is not impossible.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The best way I found to that
is to actually tap this key a little places

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:32.760
key and that will show you things you can
zoom in on.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Got you.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.850
And then you can just keep hitting that tab
until you're...

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:36.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.720
And readjusting and just feeling frustrated
the whole time.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Right.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.379
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is something where honestly
it might be better to just integrate with

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:52.899
nice maps that--API or at least give some
thought to how you would zoom in directly.

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:55.309
I actually thought this button might do it
but...

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:56.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It zooms out.

00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:58.429
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It actually does exactly the
opposite of what I wanted.

00:23:58.429 --> 00:23:59.429
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's interesting.

00:23:59.429 --> 00:24:03.200
As well, I look that icon on the first thing
I think is a full screen like I expected to

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.720
just, you know, go full screen...

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...and it doesn't.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720
So, that's a little bit of confusing.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, how can I zoom?

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:09.803
Well, I have to actually select it of a menu
which...

00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:11.049
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, it's on the streets.

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...wow.

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:13.309
Yeah.

00:24:13.309 --> 00:24:14.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:24:14.309 --> 00:24:15.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS.

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:18.210
1995 call they want your model of user interaction
back.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:20.962
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes, that's definitely something
you want to have front and center.

00:24:20.962 --> 00:24:25.060
That ability to really determine but it's--it's
an interesting app and I think, you know,

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:26.649
they've done something kind of cool there.

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:27.759
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:31.460
So, the scores here are--aren't fair at all.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:37.029
We score based on traveling booking as oppose
to the certain niche app and let's take a

00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:38.149
look at what we've got here.

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:39.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I rather suspect that the scores
are going to come in the end.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:40.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Scores are at the end.

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.850
We've...

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:42.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:43.850
Now, I can see where we were going now.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.409
&gt;&gt; MEIER: In fusion, the scores will go after
we've discussed the app.

00:24:47.409 --> 00:24:48.409
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.409
&gt;&gt; MEIER: For now, we're going to bump bounce
through each of the apps first and then go

00:24:50.409 --> 00:24:52.559
back and have a look how we each of them scored
on our...

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:53.559
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Perfect.

00:24:53.559 --> 00:24:54.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...prescriptions.

00:24:54.559 --> 00:24:55.559
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:56.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, the next app.

00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:58.509
Let's bring up Kayak and dig a little deeper
there as well.

00:24:58.509 --> 00:25:00.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Quite right.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.629
Did we want to bring up Kayak or did you want
to bring Hipmunk?

00:25:03.629 --> 00:25:04.629
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Hipmunk.

00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:05.629
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-huh.

00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:07.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm looking at next slide instead
of current slide.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.039
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I am absolutely not the only
one making mistakes today.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:12.479
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:13.909
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:15.350
Hipmunk, okay.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:21.479
First thing they really did make some efforts
to be more Androidy.

00:25:21.479 --> 00:25:22.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:25:22.869 --> 00:25:27.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Unfortunately, some of those
efforts felt a little misguided.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yup.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.931
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: For instance, it was actually
in the--they said oh, yeah we tried to make

00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:36.570
it more Androidy by squaring off a corner
so they're not rounded.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It shows it's Androidy.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320
I can see that.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.679
You know, what we don't have an entire hour
to discuss that so let's just--let's just

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:50.570
point out that--these buttons down here in
the corner should almost certainly be on a

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:51.570
action bar.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:53.570
I mean they are actions, right?

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They are.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.350
Now, the icons here look like more or less
standard like Android icons.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.230
They don't do the same thing.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The--this looks like settings
right down here.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Looks like settings.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.230
No, it is filter.

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There is a filter icon.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:09.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There's a filer icon.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.230
Yeah.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:11.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Settings should actually take
you to settings.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:14.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That should point out as well we
don't want settings to be an action.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.269
Which probably leave you [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:18.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There was an [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Unless settings is absolutely

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.220
crucial for your application.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This is nice.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, the [INDISTINCT] map is kind
of awesome.

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:26.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Very cool.

00:26:26.799 --> 00:26:27.799
Yeah.

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:29.629
Now, this is the list icon.

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:32.619
It's a little confusing but it will allow
you to view the hotels by list.

00:26:32.619 --> 00:26:33.619
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:34.750
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Here's the problem.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.919
It will pop out at the host.

00:26:37.919 --> 00:26:40.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Search first and tap to view this
list of hotels.

00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:43.879
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Please do not press this button
again.

00:26:43.879 --> 00:26:47.149
So, this is a scolding toast.

00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:48.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, it is.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You're scolding...

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: he's done the wrong the thing.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:52.950
Oops.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You're holding it wrong.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Instead, I mean you're popping
up the toast to tell them what to do.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.950
Why don't you just do it?

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.999
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:26:56.999 --> 00:27:00.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, you're never not looking
at a map in this cell.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:01.809
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This is true.

00:27:01.809 --> 00:27:04.870
I noticed that when I was sort of playing
around with the app earlier.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.960
I'm trying to find, you know, is there a sort
of a step back from that and it's not--it's

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.299
all map that and which is kind of a nice idea
you have this sort of reach interface you

00:27:13.299 --> 00:27:17.000
can see exactly way you're looking the way
you can stay.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Now...

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I really want you to [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: As far on a...

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.499
So, if I type in Venice it all will be...

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:28.139
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So this is something...

00:27:28.139 --> 00:27:29.159
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It still wants me to go to Florida.

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:35.850
Now, if I dismiss this, dismiss the keyboard
and say search then it works.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Interesting.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:37.850
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:42.429
Now, while it's working we can complain a
little bit about the progress bar.

00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:43.429
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:46.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, the progress bar is completely
running.

00:27:46.309 --> 00:27:51.490
It doesnít look like any progress bar that
exists in Android at all.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.029
And it's not clear exactly what I'm going
to do with.

00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:56.040
I guess the access for cancel--I mean that's
make sense.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Usually the cancel.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, that's nice but it's
down at the very bottom of the screen...

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.210
Small...

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...will be very...

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...soft touch.

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...yeah, very small touch target
would be very easy to accidentally hit the

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:09.210
home key.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.210
I'm not loving yet.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:12.450
Now, it just kind of looks tact on.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:20.100
You know, I really much prefer to see something
like a refreshing image in the action bar

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.610
something to show that progress is something
much like you would see if you hit refresh

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.679
on Gmail or something like that.

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:27.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, once I'm there it's very
cool.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.309
I can toggle all the heat maps and I can see
what kind of vice is in the area.

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.009
Oh, that's wrong.

00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:37.110
Venice is full of vice everywhere and I don't
where they count their vice.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's a very good question.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.929
Is it location specific or does it figure
out the way you're on now and then...

00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:43.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's a good question.

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:50.259
I think they're selling unrolled something
that we can't talk about on TV.

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.259
Okay.

00:28:51.259 --> 00:28:55.289
So, really nice features but the UI could
use some work.

00:28:55.289 --> 00:29:00.529
Now, once I actually get in here, you know,
we've got the nice stuff and it's says no,

00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:01.529
we've got...

00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:04.409
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And it even got a TripAdvisor reviews
and in fact.

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.409
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:06.850
Yeah, yeah, so I like that.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.509
That's nice.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:11.329
It would maybe like a few more pictures...

00:29:11.329 --> 00:29:12.489
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:29:12.489 --> 00:29:15.181
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You can see they've a--they done
some weird things.

00:29:15.181 --> 00:29:16.749
It's like they've got their own...

00:29:16.749 --> 00:29:18.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, that's not quite.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You see how that bounces around.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Not quite right.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.190
Yeah.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:24.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, it's cool.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:25.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I mean, you know, somebody obviously
spends some time with that, they certainly

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.889
didnít make it worse.

00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:34.899
My only concern is that when you write your
own unless it's doing something that is incredibly

00:29:34.899 --> 00:29:39.830
important to your app you sort of opening
yourself up for some real problems later on.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:48.570
Sure, you know, we love the bouncy feel now
but later on if the Android Platform goes

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.929
in a different direction everyone else is
going to pick up that updated field and you're

00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:57.190
going to be stock with this thing that is
going to end up feeling updated.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:02.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, there's no problem in taking
some of the built in framework components

00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:03.549
in modifying them.

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:07.249
Having--adding a little bit if your own spice
to it, but it something you want to do carefully

00:30:07.249 --> 00:30:11.620
knowing that at anytime you could run the
risk of starting to look aged and old.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.739
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's also very difficult to get
back to were you where.

00:30:14.739 --> 00:30:15.739
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:17.419
I noticed that the navigation isn't quite
right.

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:20.320
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's really easy to back out
of something.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.749
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: In fact they have multiple ways
to back out of a screen including the up affordance

00:30:25.749 --> 00:30:28.970
and an action button and the back button.

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.839
But then to get back into that hotel search
you got to research.

00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:34.209
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You do the whole thing.

00:30:34.209 --> 00:30:35.209
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: What's, you know, it's a pain.

00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:37.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's--one of the things which I--which
I noticed about this app, and it's something

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:41.940
I've seen quite a lot of, is sort of, you
navigate into something which has a view pager

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.059
and then that view pager has an entirely different
context.

00:30:45.059 --> 00:30:46.980
So it's like this is about the hotel.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.700
This is reviews.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.270
As you're swiping through it makes sense but
you kind of feel like you're navigating through

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.440
the app.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's sort of a totally different
UI.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:00.610
And then I often find myself then hitting
back to then, you know, go back to say the

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.500
previous, you know, the previous view pager
which isn't the behavior that should happen.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.270
But then I find myself back here, back here
at the--at the search screen and then I have

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.270
to do the whole thing again.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:16.559
I have wait for it to complete and so you
kind want a way to prevent that accidental

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:17.899
back behavior from really ruining your day.

00:31:17.899 --> 00:31:24.050
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And what's even worse is that
here--I'm going through exactly the same dance

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:25.519
that I had to go through last time.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.519
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:31.519
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Which is extremely disturbing
considering that if I go all the way back

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:35.799
here and tried a flight search, it has a recentÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It doesÖ

00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:36.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ösearches option.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:37.799
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:31:37.799 --> 00:31:41.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So why doesnít it have a recent
searches option for hotels?

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.070
I'm actually more likely to need thatÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:49.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ösince it's not all composed
because I haven't necessarily decided where

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.809
I'm going to stay or which particular suburbÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:52.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ÖI'm going to be in.

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:53.840
I mean I do a lot of different hotelÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ösearches andÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And typicallyÖ

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ÖI want to go back to them.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:59.369
Typically you're going to do, you know, several
different hotel searches in different areas.

00:31:59.369 --> 00:32:02.240
You want to be able to compare them easily
and I think that's really thing you want to

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.789
be able to do really quickly is have this
list of hotels that you're considering and

00:32:05.789 --> 00:32:08.120
just be able to click through them and thenÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öreview them all.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, notice it s location aware,
so it found outÖ

00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:11.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:32:11.169 --> 00:32:13.669
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Öyou know, where we're at and
I think, you know, we're going to Honolulu

00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:14.669
sure.

00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:15.669
No, no, no.

00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:16.669
I think we're going to Venice.

00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:17.860
Now, again.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.859
See, interesting so nowÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This is the most interestingÖ

00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:24.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öa little bit [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ömatch that I've seen actually.

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:25.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:26.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:32:26.929 --> 00:32:27.929
You know what, screw Venice.

00:32:27.929 --> 00:32:28.929
We're going toÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Going to Athens.

00:32:28.929 --> 00:32:29.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ÖAthens.

00:32:29.929 --> 00:32:30.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:32:30.929 --> 00:32:31.929
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:32.929
Now, this is the part I do really like.

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:34.059
This is a good UI.

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:36.970
I can--you know, I'm going to go over Thanksgiving.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:37.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.069
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No better time to go to Athens.

00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:43.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Now, the interesting thing here.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.970
So I looked at this app a little while ago
and you've correctly, you know, done your

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.340
from and to dates.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.619
I made the mistake the first time and I'm
not sure if it will work, of just pressing

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:55.619
the date I was going to leave and then hitting
done.

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:56.721
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And that will give you a one-way
flight.

00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:59.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And that gives me one-way flight
and I couldn't, for the life of me, figure

00:32:59.309 --> 00:33:03.429
out how to turn a one-way flight into a return
flight until someone had the good sense to

00:33:03.429 --> 00:33:05.380
just, you know, click a second date.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.169
So it's a really easy to use interface.

00:33:08.169 --> 00:33:09.750
It's wonderful but it's not discoverable.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.610
So that's something you want to consider is,
you know, chances are in most cases, people

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.610
are looking for a return flight.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:21.230
And so you want to make really obvious if
there--if anyone selected one date that this

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.450
going to result in a one-way and perhaps they
should click a return date if they want to

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.450
have a return.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, here is an example of a
case where they--they may not have completely

00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:33.820
thought through their layout because as you
can see over here.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.919
The calendar is very nicely formatted.

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:37.919
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:42.650
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Most of the really important
data has been put in to, you know, bold fonts

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.480
that are a good size and good readability
for the screen.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.629
But then you've got three areas, the two buttons
and this little area up here that says tap

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:54.210
down to continue, it is just sort of taking
up space.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:55.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:59.409
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Telling me something that I'm
sure I already knew.

00:33:59.409 --> 00:34:02.210
And those are in a tiny and almost illegible
font.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:03.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.210
You're right.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:08.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think a lot of this comes from
making some assumptions about the devices

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.049
that you program on.

00:34:10.049 --> 00:34:11.049
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:14.540
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Especially when it comes to screen
size and density.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:19.930
Remember that some screens are relatively
small but incredibly dense.

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:20.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And if you're not thinking about
that sort of HD density then you're going

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:27.669
to have a bad time.

00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:30.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And actually, while you had that
screen back upÖ

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.400
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öyou knowÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm going to do the search because

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.400
it's going toÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It just takes a little while.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Ötake a while, yeah.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.640
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So one of the interesting things
I noted is when you've got that calendar view

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.640
up, it comes up as a dialog.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.680
Now, I know why it comes up as a dialog, it's
because if you're on the web and you need

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.920
to choose a calendar entry, you want to put
it in a dialog.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.000
You want to put a little screen which comes
up rather than having the entire display taken

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.040
up with it.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:55.830
On your phone, that was already covering 90%
of the screen, why not just make it a full

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.870
screen activity and have it behave in that
same way.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.990
I have it done affordance at the top, so that
you can just continue that way rather than

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.150
having a sort of weird pop dialog which doesn't
really work.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.620
I think in most cases on a mobile device.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.810
It's harder to write code that way.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:15.010
It's a little harder to manage the activity
stack and it doesn't buy you anything does

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.010
it?

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.010
Because there'sÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.010
You donítÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Önothing you can [INDISTINCT]

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öget anything extra for it.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:25.250
So the other thing too is that if you put
it in a full screen activity then all of the

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:28.830
navigation has sort of been done for you by
the framework.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Good example of this would be
the alarm clock app, where you also have to

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.050
set a, you know, date and time.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.080
And they just have, you know, full screen
and done.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.951
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: At least they do now, I think.

00:35:40.951 --> 00:35:41.951
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:41.951 --> 00:35:42.951
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:35:42.951 --> 00:35:43.951
I think they didn't before actually.

00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:44.951
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Indeed.

00:35:44.951 --> 00:35:45.951
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I donít know.

00:35:45.951 --> 00:35:46.951
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think there use to be more of
those pop ups but it'sÖ

00:35:46.951 --> 00:35:47.951
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:35:47.951 --> 00:35:48.951
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öa trend that we seeing more and
more of in mobiles, sort of design.

00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:51.420
It's getting rid of dialogs in all places
and having full screen activities whenever

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.420
you can.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:53.420
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.420
Now, this is great.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.090
This is--it's showing me, you know, where
I can go.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:36:01.410
I mean, so if I do Cathay I'm going to have
a layover in Hong Kong which is great.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.410
Cathay isÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.410
Cathay is nice.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Öalways take that.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Emirates is nice too.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: First thing, you know, then you--you
know, oh yeah.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:12.105
Well, I've never been able to take Emirates,
you know why?

00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:13.105
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Why is that?

00:36:13.105 --> 00:36:14.105
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm not special.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.105
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:36:15.105 --> 00:36:16.105
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Based in the U.S.

00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:17.105
You'll get used to it.

00:36:17.105 --> 00:36:18.105
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This is great.

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.105
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You don't get any good service
from the U.S.

00:36:19.105 --> 00:36:20.105
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, you know, I moved here and
suddenly like all of the good airlines; Singapore,

00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:21.440
Emirates, Cathay, Yeah.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:23.530
Not so much.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.060
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And New Zealand is like the best
way to get back home.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:34.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm not sure what that says, but
it's nothing good.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.010
Just don't fly Northwest that's all I'm saying.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.290
Anyway so layover in Zurich, and then, you
know, et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.940
So that's some nice stuff and it's--again
it's listed by agony soÖ

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:41.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But this is--this a really nice
display.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can also always take that list
the price.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:45.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I really like what they're showing
here.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It feels like the actual way that
they've implemented the layout here isn't

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.660
quite as nice as it could be.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, they've something which
is incredibly useful.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.570
I mean this is I think one of real selling
points of the app, is just how useful the

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:05.140
screen is but, you know, if you look at things
like the, you know, the prices along--prices

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.380
along the left here.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.730
That it all feels a little bit cramped in.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:09.730
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There's not enough spacing around
the elements.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.640
Each of the line items seems just a little
bit too little.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Like the rows need to just be a
little bit higher, I think.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:21.770
You know, sort of 48 pixel rhythm, you know,
follow the sort of design guideline ideas

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.770
that we have there.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.040
And that will just make it feel a little bit
more natural.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.750
Here even though it's not--it feels cramped.

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.060
You know, some of the fonts are a bit too
small.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Some of the touch targets are a
little bit too small.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:32.250
It just feels like.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We'll to be fair, they are--they
are trying to present a lot of information.

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160
That should count.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And in their defense they do
have some really good zooming.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes,
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, you can see that as they

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.180
zoom, it actually feels very intuitive.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.800
You know, things are getting bigger but they're
getting bigger in ways that are useful to

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:57.170
me that arenít exactly what I would get if
it was just a naive zoom.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.050
You know, you can see these things resizing
in more of a smart way.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So overall I like it.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:08.520
The one things I would like is a few more
options here to filter, buy things like frequent

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520
flyer miles.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.370
Because if you're going--even if you only
take one trip a year, if it's this long, you

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.220
want to figure out some frequent flyer things.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.580
So nice app, few issues.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.920
Let's go ahead and take a look Kayak shall
we?

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:33.281
So Kayak I thought was not really a great
design from the UI standpoint, it certainly

00:38:33.281 --> 00:38:37.530
doesn't feel at all like an Android app when
you get into it for the first time.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.670
There's no action bar.

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.130
There's this notifications button down here
that's way, way too small.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it's down at the bottom where
I'm going to probably, you know, miss it.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.050
It's a--and then it's not even a button.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.390
It's kind of a drawer.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.390
The reverse drawer.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.990
That's an interesting pattern that was popular
for a little while until people realized it's

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:58.070
kind of counter intuitive.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.990
You know, the drawer comes down from the top.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Doesn't really slide out from the
bottom.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:06.790
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And, you know, and I'm not even
to complain too much except that it's tiny

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:09.950
and it should at least have some indication
that it's a drawer.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:10.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:11.950
Absolutely.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But all it's got is a little
gradient on it, which we hate anyway.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:20.400
And also it's got the anti-Roman Nurik pattern
of right chevrons becauseÖ

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.950
And we've got the gradient filled header with
the title in the center which again is a Roman

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:26.950
Nurik anti-pattern.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:27.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.310
Now, to be fair.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.770
I don't get an iOS vibe off of this as much
as I get justÖ

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:34.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:35.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ÖKayak branding vibe.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So I'm good with that.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:40.530
But, you know, it's a little unnecessary.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:46.890
Now, when I actually search, it gives me a
progress bar that apparently they poured it

00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.310
over from Gingerbread.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.560
One thing that I loved about it, was earlier
when I was inside the Faraday cage and had

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:58.420
no connectivity whatsoever, I actually tried
this and it turns out that progress bar goes

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.480
at a constant speed.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.310
Hits 99% and then just stops.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Progress bars are hard.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I love this, part.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.060
Yes.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.540
Probably a bar was not the greatest idea.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:10.820
I think a progress circle spinner.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.510
If you don't know how long it's going to take
and this is--this is a genuine problem often

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:15.510
you just--you just donít know.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:16.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I mean, you don't want to have that,
kind of, the old Microsoft joke were it's

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:20.240
like, you know, five minutes to two days,
three hours, you know.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's not good.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.780
If you don't know it, that's fine.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.060
Just have a spinner, have something which
basically implies, look work is being done.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.490
Rest assured, but we don't know how long.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:32.490
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.600
If you don't know how long--unless you are
actually trying to teach Zeno's paradox.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That would work.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that could be useful.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:44.470
So we get into this, once we got--we got some
branding here which is, I think attractive.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Feels a little odd to me given
that we have very little space on this device.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:57.270
So all of the rounding and drop shadows and
craziness that's going on there feels a little

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.760
bit like wasted space to me.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.360
But I think that's a matter of opinion.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.360
&gt;&gt;MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:09.340
I think my biggest concern looking at this
is more just the plethora of gradients.

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:14.560
And gradients with reverse gradients to imply
selection, you know, that bar up the top here

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.170
just looks, you know, kind of weird.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.170
&gt;&gt;NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:19.970
It's actually really difficult to see what
your selection is.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:20.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:27.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then, of course we've got
from gradient land down to ugly, ugly system

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.700
dialog land.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why?

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Plus, you know, this idea that you'll
lost unsafe progress.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.830
Don't tell me that I'm going to lose progress,
just make it so that I don't lose progress.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:37.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:38.830
Exactly.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's again it's the--you're holding
it wrong.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.280
That's not the way this app works, don't do
it this way.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: If you have enough users who are
using the app wrong, that you feel the need

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.680
to tell them, that they using the app wrongÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Maybe they are not the one's

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680
that are wrong.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm just saying.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.740
So anyway, let's--you know, so it's got a
lot of the features that you'd expect.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think they're all done relatively
well.

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:08.650
I don't know who this map provider is Bing,
but you know they seem to be all right, up

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:11.100
and coming, you know or whatever.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's doing all right.

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:18.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: This plus and minus zoom buttons
I think were maybe stolen from somewhere.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that looks--actually looks
like--I know, in fairness I think that's the

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.010
default control that you can apply to any
map or indeed anything.

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.010
So that's, you know.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's just looks kind of old school
but I think that'sÖ

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, All right.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's the Androids ones.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:31.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.590
There with the gradient?

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it was for back in Gingerbread
land.

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:36.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But I could be wrong.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:37.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.380
WellÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it looks--it looks familiar

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:40.380
to me.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I apologize.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:42.380
I apologize.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.420
So, again here you know you got the rounded
corners.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.750
You know, I don't know, I don't want to hate
on that.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.400
I think it looks good.

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.680
The main question that I had when I saw this
is; is it going to perform well?

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.680
And the truth is, yes.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.170
It performs really, really, really well.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:43:01.090
It's just very, very fast on this Jelly Bean
phone.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.530
So I can't really complain about it.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:09.280
It does have the right chevrons which bother
us just because, we feel like in Android it

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:17.270
should be apparent to everyone that items
in a list can be clicked on to get more stuff.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:22.970
And if you have a chevron it sort of implies
that there is something special about that

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.640
chevron as opposed to the rest of the list
item.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.070
And that's very rarely case.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And if it is the case then you
should actually separate it out and maybe

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.770
consider using something more descriptive
than a chevron for it.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:42.030
The main problem though that I have with Kayak,
is at some point it removes it's Android mask

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.950
and reveals itself for what it really is,
which is a front end to a bunch of lousy websites.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.140
Well, not lousyÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: They're not lousy.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.359
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Öbut certainly not optimized
for mobile.

00:43:50.359 --> 00:43:51.359
&gt;&gt; MEIER: They're not optimized.

00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:52.359
Yeah.

00:43:52.359 --> 00:43:55.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So, all of a sudden I'm back
a web browser, thinking, wow, why did I download

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.670
this app, it's just--it's just a bunch of
bookmarks.

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:02.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Why would you download an app
that's just a bookmark.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.290
All right, but again we do have a lot of nice
features.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, you got Flight Tracker here,
we've got you know currency conversion.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.720
So a lot of stuff that you want to have and
use while you're on the go.

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.840
I mean, one thing which I would point out
here, that--so in this implementation they

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:21.700
don't have a real action bar, or at least
they donít always use it.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:25.240
And so you've got this list view which is
kind of a dashboard pattern but it's a list

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.940
so it's kind of skirts the, you know, the
guidelines there.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.940
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is fine.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I have to ask myself, how
does this all fit together?

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:35.490
I mean, it seems like what we've done is put
a grab bag of really interesting functionality.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:38.570
I'm sorry I didn't mean to step on your foot
there.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:39.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's all right.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:40.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's all right.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:41.570
Yeah.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.570
This whole--this whole standing up thing is
going to take some getting used to.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:43.570
Yeah.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:44.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's kind of whack, yeah.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So the problem is you've got
a grab bag of functionality, all of which

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:53.810
seems useful but none of which really does
a task for me.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.780
It's not a task-oriented interface.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.710
What I really need is something that's going
to take me through the entire processes.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, where do you want to
go?

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:04.710
How do you want to get there?

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.710
What do you want to do when you're there?

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:06.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:07.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Here's where the holes are.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:11.320
You know, you forgot to get transportation
from this flight to this hotel.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.520
What are you doing?

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.680
And even here, like you look--you're looking
at these tasks and there's just an overwhelming

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.600
number of things that you can do, whereas
I think everything once you get past, you

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.380
know, price alerts really.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:29.570
airline directory, airline fees, airport information,
preferences, my location, watching tweets

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.910
from Kayak, feedbacks about, all of that seems
like it isn't really the purpose of the app.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.230
And it just becomes a distraction.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.680
You know, you're just flicking through here
going oh wow, there's a lot of stuff that

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.990
this can do, I'm really only going to look
at the first three, because everything beyond

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.990
that is just too much.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.260
You've got this whole list of extra features,
it's like oh thank God they're in this app

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.600
because it's not like it have a smart phoneÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ÖOr anything.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.330
So here is my advice.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:58.940
First, make the booking part of this app more
task-oriented, more oriented around planning

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:05.060
an entire trip as opposed to interacting with
different modes of travel.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:09.900
Second, why not figure out what the user needs
at the particular time.

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.590
If I'm sitting at home, I probably want to
do some booking.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.890
If I'm out on the road already, especially
if I'm inside of a trip, you know during a

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:24.320
trip that you know about because I booked
it through your app, why not give me all of

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.200
the features that are down here at the bottom.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Then.

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.820
Try and--basically you've got all of this
information, you are running on this person's

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.680
smart phone, you know a lot about them just
from the information which you have got from

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.160
their bookings if nothing else.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.670
So you really want to try and contextualize
your app based on what it is that people are

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:46.580
likely to be using, what they're likely to
be trying to do.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.650
All right.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.480
Well, let's go ahead and take a look at a
couple more.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.840
Now, you had a look at FastBooking.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:56.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I think we already looked
at several of the features of this app but

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.530
how do you feel about the UI?

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:08.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So again, this UI looks really kind
of--it's kind of interesting because it's--it

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.890
is flat which is nice.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:14.570
We kind of like this--the flat idea in Android
but again it feels like it's a little bit

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:15.800
too cramped.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.000
Like all of the details that we've got underneath
these almost tabs at the top are tiny, tiny

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
little fonts.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.640
To a degree we probably can't even see it
online.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.680
And I'd like to make that information bigger,
you know this is kind of key data.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.960
It's you're check-in dates, how many nights
you're staying, how many people.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's all of the filters that you
want to apply.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.290
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well this is something that always
kind of kills me.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:39.110
Because if you go back to main screen, look
at all this area down here, right.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You got a huge amount of blank space.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.301
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All we've got is an area that
says I don't have any results to show you.

00:47:44.301 --> 00:47:45.860
Well, you know what?

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.860
Awesome.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:50.610
Look it all that space that you can use to
make your interface less cramped.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:59.490
And what a great opportunity to get your users
started on a task, instead I start the app

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:02.530
by feeling inadequate alreadyÖ
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, [INDISTINCT]

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.230
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: because there's all this space
that I haven't filled.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:09.680
And then I need to figure out these little
tiny buttons up at the top.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.390
To be fair, they're not completely tiny, but
they're still pretty small.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: They are.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:14.450
Let see.

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:15.450
Here we go.

00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:16.450
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:17.450
Where is that?

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:19.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: If we're very lucky it's going to
come back, sweet.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Awesome.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And so again so you've this weird
combination between having tiny, tiny little

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.050
fonts and then, large amounts of white space.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.350
Like if you're looking over in this section
here, again white space.

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.130
And we've got these pictures which is nice,
but the pictures are tiny.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:38.471
So you almost want to do something, you know,
maybe even a full bleed effect, so it's just

00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:40.460
basically pictures with text over it.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.670
I don't know how well it would work.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:42.720
But I think it'sÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öit's a way to try and you know
get rid of some white space and replace it

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.690
with useful information.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:52.500
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I think really to boil
down what Reto is saying is that if you look

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:58.060
at modern apps right now, that are visually
oriented, you will see that the trend is to

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:03.220
make the pictures much bigger and much more
a part of the UI and people like that.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And they've done a great job.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It looks beautiful.

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Once you sort of navigate in, you
can see here, we've got this scrolling gallery

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720
of pictures.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is wonderful and this--you've
got these resources and this is something

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.910
that I think this App does better than most
of the ones we looked at, is really showing

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.443
of the pictures and having a big gallery of
things for each of the places.

00:49:19.443 --> 00:49:23.770
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, you're right, but I'll
tell you if this had been created by for instance

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:27.260
some of the photo people that we talked to
last week, you know what I think you'd be

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:35.230
seeing on that thing that you just switched
away from, I think that this entire area here

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.810
that the area with the caption.

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:38.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:43.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Would be semi-transparent over
the top of the picture.

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.474
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, I think you might be right.

00:49:45.474 --> 00:49:46.474
Yeah.

00:49:46.474 --> 00:49:48.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think they would make--use
that opportunity to just make the picture

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.480
a lot bigger.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly, I mean the picture here
is what's selling it right?

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.710
I mean we've got this big block of text which
you will really read but if you're sort of

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:58.290
flicking through a bunch of different hotel
options, it's the pictures which is going

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:02.650
to--is going to make you spot and actually
find out if the room offers features that

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.850
you want as well as looking great.

00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:07.680
You know, again we've kind of got this non-standard
tabs along the top.

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.740
It feels like you could do better just using
a sort of something like a view pager or at

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.210
least sort of more standard tabs.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:18.030
The gallery has, sort of again, unnecessary
white space, great opportunity to have something

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:19.300
really rich and engaging here.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.300
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The white space really is a shame.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.020
It really is.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So this interesting.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.210
So we've got the star affordance which is
the right way to indicate that, you know,

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:33.350
you want save something or like something
inside of Android, but you know again we're

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.942
using toasts along the bottom to notify folks
of what you've done.

00:50:35.942 --> 00:50:39.589
Again you shouldn't really need to tell peopleÖ
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah thatÖ

00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:40.589
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Öwhat it does.

00:50:40.589 --> 00:50:41.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Öfeels like a debug toast.

00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:42.589
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:44.950
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it feels like the programmer
wanted to make sure that something was actually

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:45.950
done.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:46.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All you need to do is fill in
the star, which is what they did.

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:49.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Filling in the star says, yeah
we made this a favorite.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:51.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, it's starred.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.880
You know, likewise once we navigate through
it, we can see that the up affordance isn't

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.160
being used at the top here.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.120
So that's--you know, given that this is a
standard action bar.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: A little display.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It would be nice to see that being
done.

00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:05.400
Otherwise, yeah, I mean, that's the thing
we've got the--we've got the chevrons here

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.280
which again we'd prefer not to see.

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.400
So, I think that's the key thing for this
app.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.700
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, do they--do they do anything
different?

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.830
I mean if I press the chevron, does it do
anything?

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:15.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I don't believe so.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.830
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's kind of the same.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.830
And you can actually see here that the scroll
bar...

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.369
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Is over the top of the chevrons.

00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:21.590
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...is overlay--overlaying this,
the chevrons.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, that's interesting.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:23.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, that's a [INDISTINCT] right
there.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.710
So, it's a, you know, the chevron isn't doing
anything, it's just confusing the user.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.880
There are UI designs that are not Android...

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:39.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...where the chevron is important
but those systems generally have a very strong

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.080
right word...

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...flow, right?

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080
So, that it'll actually...

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.080
It's like you click and everything moves.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, it kind of makes sense.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Whereas with Android, you don't
necessarily know that it's--what it's going

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.860
to do and it could be different based on platform
versions or even carrier implementations.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:52.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.500
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But otherwise--so, I think that's
the big feedback there.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:59.130
I think it could do, you know, you've got
great information, useful functionality.

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.570
It's just needs a little bit of the UI refreshed
to make a little bit more richer, a little

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.570
bit more engaging.

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:04.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:06.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, I think we've got a couple more
minutes.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.330
We want to get a chance to, you know, do an
overview of each of the apps but the last

00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:15.150
one we're about to look at is TripAdvisor,
which I really quite like, you know.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:19.130
So, again, it's a very similar sort of look
to Kayak, when we open it up here.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:22.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You've got hotels, restaurants,
flights, forums [INDISTINCT], my saves and

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:23.930
writer reviews.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.960
So, again, here, they've cut it off at--it's
about a page's worth, which is nice.

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And there's none of the extra stuff.

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.690
The extra stuff lives here in the other flow
menu.

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:37.210
And in fact, some of them are duplicated,
so [INDISTINCT] and my saves are both also

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.700
in the overflow.

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:42.020
So, you think you need them in both places,
could you save some space by moving these

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.980
off the main menu.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.940
And tools, I think they've got--basically
links to other apps, which is, I think going

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.140
along the model you were suggesting earlier.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:51.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Do you need to bundle a currency
converter or can you just include a link to

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:54.580
an app...

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:55.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...which does that specifically.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:57.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:58.580
I mean maybe it's a check box for people but...

00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.780
And so, for TripAdvisor, they've got city
guides, so this is...

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:01.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...you know, that full-service model,
which we were talking about, so that, you

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.580
know--you're in a place, you want to get the
guides, find out what to do, you can download

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:09.260
the city guides, so you got that extra information.

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:14.090
So, they're using the appropriate search,
which is nice if you navigate through.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.320
Again, they're not really using the up affordance
in the way we would expect in a big branding,

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.270
the TripAdvisor up along the top, in the action
bar.

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:25.790
I personally kind of prefer to see this changed
around, so that they're just using the icon

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:27.680
and then using up affordance to help the navigation.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.280
The truth is that, having TripAdvisor in the
title bar probably isn't important at all.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:40.630
You have a very distinctive icon and just
using the icon with some useful text there

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:41.740
instead of [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...tell me where I am in the
app for instance...

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:44.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:45.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...or use that space for buttons.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:49.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Because as far as--I think the app
falls down a little bit is that in terms of

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.790
navigation, it's very difficult to know where
you are, where you've been and what ways you

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.240
can back out of things, you know.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.680
We're just here, we've gone through three
levels of depth here.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:00.060
And there's sort of no indication that we're
anywhere other than the beginning of app.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:05.780
Similarly, if you sort of look at this display,
you've got kind of a mismatch or--yeah, like

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:10.210
a mismatch of different UI styles, you've
got these buttons with the sort of glassy

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:11.260
gradient...

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...which are way too small.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.280
The touch targets are much too small.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And the attractions at the top here,
just above it in tiny, tiny font, which is

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.500
actually really difficult to touch.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Looks like a web toolbar right
there.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It does.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.900
Yeah.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:24.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and then, let's talk about
the tabs above it, which...

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:25.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...you know, I wouldn't use this
word often but they look amateur.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: They do.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.160
They...

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They are not...

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.051
&gt;&gt; MEIER: They've got kind of the gradient,
reverse gradient, pressing them is very is

00:54:33.051 --> 00:54:34.051
really slow.

00:54:34.051 --> 00:54:37.530
It feels--and I'd rather suspect this might
be the case that this is actually--at least

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:38.880
some of this is actually a web view.

00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.880
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.880
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Which is fine.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.820
Like implementing it as such if you've already
got the skills but you want it to be really

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:48.330
responsive and fast and clicking on each of
these takes a fair while before it will flick

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:49.330
over.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:53.150
And we don't--we don't get any sort of the
view pager functionality, you know.

00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:57.850
These are scrolled, which again, is probably
fine but one thing I did want to highlight

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.200
here at the bottom is this, see 20 more.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.250
Don't make me press it.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:02.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Once I get to the bottom, just load
it.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:05.860
I'm down the bottom presumably I want to see
more.

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:09.980
So, it should sort of be able to keep track
of where I am in the list and automatically,

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.380
dynamically start bringing in that extra content
when...

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.380
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:14.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...I get there.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.620
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, we were over ambitious
today.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.490
We chose five apps to take a look at and that's
too much.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:20.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:22.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, you know, whatever.

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.300
We had fun and it's not like anybody else
needed this room after us, right?

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.300
In fact...

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's not like we're postponing,
you know, the new episode of Grey's Anatomy

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.780
or something.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Heaven forbid.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That sort of thing.

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.780
I don't know.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think there maybe a thing.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:35.780
I think there was a plane crash.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.780
I don't know.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:37.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Something's going on.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, let's take a look at the
final scores.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.780
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780
So, our final scores for the apps today.

00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.780
So, let's have a look.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.530
So, these are the prescriptions, just to remind
everyone because...

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:45.530
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.540
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it seems like that was a long
time ago that we had these last on screen.

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.030
So, this is what we're going to be judging
each of the apps on.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.200
I think we're using exciting star ratings
today.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:54.200
Is that right?

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.200
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.520
Well, you know, I got--I got tired of trying
to decode the color so.

00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.520
All right.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.720
You know, Worldscope Webcams did not score
well in this particular round up mostly because

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:08.560
it turned out it wasn't actually the type
of app we were looking for and also, I think

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:12.520
there was a bad by the refs, topical.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:18.260
It has a relatively consistent user interface
but it's not very good at following the Android

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:24.770
UI Guidelines, especially using a view pager
that's not really a view pager instead of

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:27.640
a navigation drop down, which is kind of what
it actually was.

00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:28.640
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And the rest of it, you know,
we're just going to skip because it's not

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:31.910
that app.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:32.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's not that app.

00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:33.910
Exactly.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:34.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's go ahead and go on to.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:40.030
Hipmunk on the other hand, much more consistent
with the design guide than a lot of the apps

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:41.030
we've looked at.

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:49.570
We gave it three stars just because it didn't
have a really consistent use of icons.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:55.020
They got some of the text completions horrifically
wrong.

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:59.590
And there are records saying that the main
thing they did for Android was taking the

00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:03.600
rounded corners off because Android can't
do rounded corners.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.600
So, if feels like they could do...

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:08.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, to be fair, they came and
apologized in person for that but still.

00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:10.220
All right.

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.220
But really, really excellent app.

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.940
We're looking forward to seeing the update
on that.

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:14.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, absolutely.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because it has very nice functionality.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.760
Kayak, of course is about as consistent as
Hipmunk, well, you know.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.580
I should've knocked off one more star here.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: They should've had an action
bar and I really wish they'd get rid of that

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.490
lengthy, lengthy list of all the things that
the app could possibly do.

00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:31.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.810
I mean we talk about this a lot and that's
focus.

00:57:32.810 --> 00:57:35.900
It's a really important thing when you're
developing an app for a smartphone, is to

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.320
figure out what it is that your app does,
which is the most important thing and make

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.600
that front and center.

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:44.040
Even at the cost of eliminating some of your
functionality.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:48.910
People tend to install your app for the main
thing it does, not because--oh, well, I was

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:53.740
choosing between Kayak and TripAdvisor but
Kayak had a currency converter, so that's

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:55.260
why I kept it around.

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:56.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's probably pretty unlikely.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.160
I feel like people are missing a golden opportunity
actually.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.450
Why not just install that separately?

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:04.380
Say, "hey, buy Kayak, you also get this currency
converter.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.380
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:09.460
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The other thing that it does
is, it doesn't complete transactions on your

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:10.630
device, it just sends you to the web.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:11.630
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:12.990
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can go to the web from any
device.

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.760
I didn't--I didn't need this app to send me
there.

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.150
So, let's take a look at the last two then.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.281
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, if I like that the stars are
moving around as we hit the button.

00:58:22.281 --> 00:58:23.281
That's kind of cool.

00:58:23.281 --> 00:58:24.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That was completely unintentional
but awesome.

00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:26.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it was.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.150
So, FastBooking, again, we kind of got the
same issue with the consistency with the design

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:32.150
guide.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.150
It feels like they're pretty close.

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:34.150
They're using an action bar.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:35.620
They've got a kind of a flat UI.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:39.960
I think they just need to look their spacing,
you know, look to have more--yeah.

00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.270
More images front and center.

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:42.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:43.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think they can really take this
and take it up to the next level.

00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:46.140
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And possibly rethink the color
scheme a little bit...

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:47.140
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:55.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...because you got a very light
name color on white and gray and it's a little

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:56.340
not contrasty enough.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.410
It could be--the whole thing could just be
have a little more punch.

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:00.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:02.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And the last app was TripAdvisor,
of course.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.330
And so, they did pretty well, they got a lot
of stars going on here.

00:59:05.330 --> 00:59:06.330
Good focus...

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think that's because we were--that
it was the end of the night.

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.260
We were both drunk and we were just giving
out stars like candy.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Stars to anyone.

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.290
It does pretty well.

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:16.290
It does your entire trip.

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:17.440
It's very location aware.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.210
It does the transactions on the device itself.

00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:24.540
Again, I think they could do a little bit
more with the design guide just to take it,

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.720
that a little bit further.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:29.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Make it a little bit more rich and
consistent.

00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:30.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:31.370
Okay.

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:32.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:33.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That was...

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:34.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, that was...

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That was fun.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:36.370
Let's not do that again.

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.781
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That was--let's not do that again.

00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:38.781
Interesting.

00:59:38.781 --> 00:59:42.100
So, if we could switch to the fullscreen view
of us as we say goodbye.

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.190
Nice.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:49.770
So, two of these apps are going to be looked
up by Roman and Nick and Adam on Android Design

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:50.770
and Action.

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:54.220
That's Kayak and Worldscope Webcam are both
going to be getting the Android Design and

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.220
Action...

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:56.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:59:56.220 --> 00:59:57.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...makeover next Tuesday morning.

00:59:57.220 --> 00:59:58.810
So, do tune in for that.

00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:03.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And stay tuned because I know
that at least some of these, Hipmunk and a

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:09.040
couple--I believe the couple of others are
updating soon and so we'll be able to see

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:13.710
what they do in response to some of the design
guidelines that we've shared with them already.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:14.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:17.710
And we'll be inviting all of the developers
from the apps that we looked at today to join

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:21.400
us next week for "The Developers Strike Back"
next Thursday at 11:30.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.130
So, if you guys--if you helped build one of
these apps and we would like to tell us exactly

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.610
what you think about our feedback.

01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:28.610
Let us know.

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:30.750
We'll make sure to get you on the show next
week.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:36.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It starts with "The App Clinic,"
then Roman and his design guidelines, then

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.870
"Developers Strike Back."

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:40.480
It is the circle of app life.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.580
We've also got--so, next week at "The App
clinic."

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.780
We're going to do video players.

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780
I think is the plan.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780
Yeah?

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.560
And we are actually going to settle on those,
right after the show.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.080
We're going to give ourselves a week this
time.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think that, that's possibly a
little ambitious because I don't think the

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.640
moderator page exists yet.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.050
So, maybe difficult for people to have nominated
their apps but we'll see.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.670
If it does exist and people have nominated,
then we will certainly be choosing them.

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:11.330
If not, then do get on quickly because as
soon as we have three to four likely candidates,

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:15.731
we will be choosing those to give us enough
time to really get into these apps and try

01:01:15.731 --> 01:01:17.260
and dig a little bit deeper.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:18.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:21.250
So, get out there, get on that moderator page.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:24.760
Hit refresh a lot, hit refresh like you're
going for Google I/O tickets.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's a lot of refreshing.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.480
We're going to take off.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.900
We've kept you guys for long enough.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.910
I think we have the Friday games review coming
up later today.

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:33.910
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:36.579
The games review is going to be at--I believe
2:00 PM and...

01:01:36.579 --> 01:01:41.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...they're paying with times,

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
they're playing with hosts.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160
They're playing with a lot of games.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Who knows what's going to happen?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160
So...

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's going to be crazy.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
Tune in.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: In any case--so, yeah.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
Tune in for that.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160
We'll be back for a bunch of shows but we're
certainly be back.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160
Hopefully we'll see you guys next week for
The App Clinic.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160
I'm Reto Meier.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm Ian Ni-Lewis
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We'll see you later.
