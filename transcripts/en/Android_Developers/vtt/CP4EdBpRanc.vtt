00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: Good afternoon and welcome to The
Friday App Clinic.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.870
My name is Reto Meier, I'm joined today in
the studio by Adam.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.870
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hello.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: And our executive producer, Ian.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.519
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hi, I'm Ian Ni-Lewis and I'm gigantic.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.520
&gt;&gt;Reto: And today, we're going to take a look
at music playing apps.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.199
These are all apps that you guys have nominated
in the moderator queue and we're going to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.039
try to get through the top five or six, depending
on how many we can get

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.649
through in the next forty-five minutes.

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.120
So, let's have a look at the apps that we're
going to check out today.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.780
So this is the list, or at least it was very
briefly and there it is again.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.610
So we'll take a look at TuneWiki--ooh,
these are all backwards on my monitor so I'm

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.610
going to look at them over here.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.750
We're going to look at
TuneWiki,XenoAmp, then we're going to check

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.070
out Spotify,UberHype, XenoAmp, PowerAmp, XenoAmp,
and Player Pro.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.540
[laughter] So--

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.570
&gt;&gt;Adam: It seems like something was nominated
more than once on that moderator queue--

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.220
There was a little bit of suspicious voting
patterns apparent on the moderator this week.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's a massive amount of enthusiasm
for XenoAmp.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely, and I personally look
forward to having a very close look at XenoAmp.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Before we do, let's have a look at our top
tips for what every good music playing app

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.300
should have.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.620
This is the music
player 'must haves.'

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.450
These are the things which we're really looking
for as fundamental to what we think makes

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.350
a
really good music playing experience.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.220
So the first one is it must play music.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now that one surprised me Reto.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.490
That seems like a really really stiff piece
of advice there--

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.490
&gt;&gt;Reto: I know.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: It might be difficult for many music
players to live up to that.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: We try and set a low bar that we thing
most people can achieve and I realize that

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.979
this one might be pushing
that a little bit high, but we'll see.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:52.979
We'll see.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.530
I think most of the apps should, should possibly
be able to match

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.530
that.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.659
&gt;&gt;Ian: We won't actually be able to tell though
because of 'The Man'.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.390
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right, "The Man" will not let
us play copyrighted music on air, so you'll

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.260
just have to take our word
for whether or not it's playing back.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Indeed.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: And in fact, that's why we have Ian
here on camera, he is going to be singing

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.840
all of the music tracks as they
come through to his headsets in real time.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: I will.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.900
I hope you cued up a lot of Lady Gaga.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.410
Well, we did use your phone so whatever's
there is what you got.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, wonderful.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: Perfect.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.480
So what else have we got on that list?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000
So we won't read through them all, we'll just
leave them up

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.340
there for you guys to check out but it's things
like--you know we're really looking for that

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.590
polished experience so
we're looking for things like the ability

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.270
to control playback over the lock screen,
through notifications.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.810
Sensible
things like using audio focus, muting when

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.010
we disconnect headphones, all those sorts
of things.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.970
We've actually gone
through and tested all of these apps for each

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.140
of these things so we will mention to you,
even if we don't necessarily

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.660
go through and try each piece for each app.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.660
So you want to get started then?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's get started.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.660
&gt;&gt;Reto: Perfect.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.470
So we're going to start off with TuneWiki
which was by far and away the most popular

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.459
of the votes
and in fact had zero down votes, which some

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.310
would consider suspicious and I just think
it's just an indication of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.510
people's enthusiasm for an awesome app.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.910
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, TuneWiki has been around on
Playstore before and on Android market for

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.910
quite some time.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.910
Yeah, it's a popular app.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.620
So why don't we--let's fire it up the tablet
so we can get the nice

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.490
high resolution graphics and see what it looks
like.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.310
&gt;&gt;Adam: All right.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.379
&gt;&gt;Reto: So--the first thing that I think we
noticed when we started this up is that it

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.550
takes an age to load.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.290
Transformer Prime is actually a pretty powerful
piece of hardware and still took like three

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.290
or four seconds.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.580
[off screen: "Transformer Prime is actually
a pretty powerful piece of hardware--"}

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: I’m sorry guys.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800
Producer fail.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
[laughter]

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
&gt;&gt;Reto: That was a little freaky.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.209
&gt;&gt;Adam: We gave you the executive title too.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.209
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think we might need to take that
back.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.070
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's exactly where you went wrong.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.070
[laughter]

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.260
&gt;&gt;Reto: Too much power.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.300
Too Quickly.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.940
&gt;&gt; Ian: You two say nothing.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.610
&gt;&gt;Adam: Even the load time that we noticed
just now, I think that this was just a little

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.760
bit quicker than the first
launch was that we tried earlier this morning.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Should we see if we can bring up the
phone cam and we'll see how long it takes

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.489
on that one.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.010
&gt;&gt;Ian: One second.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.010
[pause]

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.220
&gt;&gt;Adam: So starting now?

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.909
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.390
Two, three, four--so again, that was probably
quicker than the very first time we loaded

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.190
up but that's
still a good sort of four second load to bring

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.320
the first graphics up.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: Now that may have been influenced
by the advertising in the app as well in the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.190
free version.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.620
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's very possible so that's something
to keep in mind is that you really want that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.550
initial load time to be
as quick as you can so that developers, I

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.430
should say users, don't feel like the app
is frozen.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.430
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, that's true.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's sort of a killer move right
away.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.460
So okay, let's have a bit of the navigation
so I think first place

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.740
you want to go is 'My Music" right?

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.080
So let's see how that works.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.620
So we can see, in terms of a tablet layout,
this part hasn't been particularly

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.620
optimized.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.810
We have that sort of telltale really wide
list view sort of effect.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.000
You know which can be okay.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.560
Can be a
little bit off-putting I think if you've got

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.990
lots of black screen space or white screen
real estate that can be a big

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.130
of a negative, but generally speaking, I think
it kind of works.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.130
What do you--

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.130
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.130
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.570
&gt;&gt;Adam: They have used the action bar, you
can tell visually that they've used a view

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.800
pager with pager title strip style
here.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.949
So we have an instant indication that we swipe
left and right that we are going to get to

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.310
different content in
the application.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very nice.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.310
We've got the standard--standard looking action
bar.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.500
It doesn't look quite right, is it slightly
higher than it should be?

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.200
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, it looks like, on the tablet,
it's about the right size, but on the phone

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.640
it seems to be slightly
oversized.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:45.640
Okay.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.430
Yeah, I'm looking at them both in front of
me so that's interesting.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.570
All right.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.850
let's play a song, let's uh--

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.199
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually, would you mind putting the
phone up there Daniel so we can see what Adam's

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.639
talking about.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.070
&gt;&gt;Daniel: Sure.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: While Daniel's doing that I just want
to remind everybody that I'm watching the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.690
live stream right now on
YouTube, and so if you have any questions

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.020
that you want to pass along to Reto and Adam
go ahead and type them in

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.190
there--that's where we're watching, not on
the Google Plus stream 'cause I can only do

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.620
one thing at a time.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.389
[soft
laughter in background] All right, go ahead

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.389
guys.

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:24.460
&gt;&gt;Adam: All right, thanks man.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.449
&gt;&gt;Reto: We definitely should consider--we
should have kept something in reserve.

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.330
Executive producer should have been
the credit that you get when you CAN do two

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.330
things at once.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hmm.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: But in the meantime-- so let's have
a look--you reckon this is slightly too tall?

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.490
Can you talk us through--
how can you tell or are you just like Roman

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.930
and able to spot two pixel differences just
through raw eye?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.070
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's mostly that.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.940
&gt;&gt;Adam: In this case, it's mostly a matter
of sort of visually measuring against some

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.139
of the other elements on the
screen but the real tell-tell thing in this

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.889
UI in particular is if you check the size
of the touch highlight that

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.460
sits there, you notice that the button itself
of the touch target itself is slightly smaller

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.509
than the full bar.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:01.870
Now, that's not a bad thing on its own, but
it does sort of reveal the difference here.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.139
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.139
Okay.

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.990
So that's nice, I mean while we're looking
at the action bar as well, I'd point out that

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.069
you've kind of got settings menu is here as
well, which again isn't a standard preferences

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:18.340
screen--you can tell from
these right carets or chevrons which are non-standard

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.990
so it's obviously custom.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.139
It's looks relatively standard so
it's not too bad but it would be kind of nice--there's

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.639
no real reason not to go with the standard
on the preferences

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.280
screen here so would be kind of nice if you
guys did.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280
&gt;&gt;Adam: If you go back--

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can you touch one of those, I'm really
curious why people use the right caret.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.250
I have my own theories but--

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.500
&gt;&gt;Adam: Usually it's just to indicate that
there's another screen underneath it that's

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.069
going to take you someplace
different.

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:49.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: [sharp intake of breath] I think that's
true, but why in particular the right caret

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:56.770
because the action
for going to another screen has nothing to

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.960
do with anything to the right of what you
see right--

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960
That's true.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.639
&gt;&gt;Ian:-- so I guess what I'm implying is that
maybe that's a carryover from you know some

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.430
other type of system where
the animation is different or---

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, it feels that way, like as though
maybe the developers have used a different

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.110
operating system which
perhaps when you hit right everything slides

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.541
from left to right so that you can sort of--

00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.009
&gt;&gt;Adam: You mean an operating system like
Gingerbread?

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:20.069
&gt;&gt;Reto: Possibly.

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:23.160
[laughs] Possibly a different operating system
like Gingerbread.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.520
&gt;&gt;Adam: So one of the other elements here
as well is--the design guide I believe explicitly

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.320
calls out the case of
settings as something that shouldn't be either

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.930
frequent, important or typical--so realistically
that should be in an

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.930
overflow--

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.669
&gt;&gt;Adam:--but it's entirely understandable
in a case like this where that's the only

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:45.350
option that would be in the
overflow there's sort of a simple judgment

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.680
call to be made there.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680
I agree.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.929
I think in this case though I mean what you've
got here if nothing else is just taking up

00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:52.929
more screen real estate.

00:08:52.929 --> 00:08:55.480
It's something else the user has to look at
and understand.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.420
Like you see a cog and you're
like "What does the cog mean?"

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.940
Which means you need to press it to find out,
and I think just having that overflow

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.769
menu is kind of where users are expecting
things like settings to be so it makes it

00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:10.829
sort of cognitively easy to
understand what you're supposed to do because--and

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:14.040
again this is something I tend to go on a
bit at length but it's

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.309
creating that magical experience where as
soon as you launch the app, you should be

00:09:18.309 --> 00:09:21.839
doing whatever it is the app is
designed to do straightaway.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:25.160
So you shouldn't have to spend time exploring
the app and figuring out how it all works

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.720
in order to understand it's value.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.999
Like people are going to install this, start
using it, and the less they have to

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:35.160
think about how things work, it's kind of
the more of a magical experience it is for

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.160
those people.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.249
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's definitely true, but what you
need to watch out for as well--and I think

00:09:39.249 --> 00:09:44.071
what developers look at when they
make decisions such as this-- is what do you

00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.550
do--a lot of developers will count clicks--

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.550
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.480
&gt;&gt;Adam:-- in terms of how deep an action is
or how complex the process for getting to

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.420
a particular action is.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.920
And I
think in this case the decision was made "Okay,

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.200
one click is better than two."

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:06.410
&gt;&gt;Adam: So--but that's not always the only
metric you should use when deciding on UI

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.410
elements such as this.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, I think what you were saying
earlier is kind of the key there is--it's--you

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.550
want to make it really
quick and easy to do the things that are most

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.089
important for your app.

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:15.279
Anything that you don't want people to do
all

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:17.439
the time, can afford to live further away.

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:19.870
In fact, we had this discussion when we were
looking at this app earlier

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.879
today around the "My Profile" button.

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:22.879
&gt;&gt;Adam: We did.

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:24.679
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can I cut in for just a second?

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:25.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: You can.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:28.779
&gt;&gt;Ian: Umm, several people are mentioning
that Adam's far too quiet.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:30.009
&gt;&gt;Adam: Oh, am I?

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:32.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, so you might want to--

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.589
&gt;&gt;Adam: Is that just because I keep turning
my head when I'm talking?

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:35.589
&gt;&gt;Ian: That--possibly.

00:10:35.589 --> 00:10:39.439
Um, it might also be the mic volume and also
just project Adam, just project.

00:10:39.439 --> 00:10:41.249
I think you've
still got half a shot of whiskey there you

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:42.929
might want to down it.

00:10:42.929 --> 00:10:43.929
[laughter]

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:45.980
&gt;&gt;Adam: There's none here.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.980
Okay.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.029
&gt;&gt;Reto: All right, now we have loud Adam hopefully.

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:51.029
&gt;&gt;Adam: I think we're good to go.

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:53.959
&gt;&gt;Reto: Maybe I should just be more quiet
and we can just adjust all the gain up.

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:58.769
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think that would be a terrible idea,
I think you guys should be like our boss when

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:03.089
we're in a teleconference
[laughter] and he starts like shouting at

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:04.149
the people across the room.

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:06.670
I think that's how you guys
should think of yourself right now.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: All Right.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.670
We can do that.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:09.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Project!

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.670
&gt;&gt;Adam: Shout at the users.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.670
&gt;&gt;Reto: Shout at the users--

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Pretty much.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.670
&gt;&gt;Reto:--and the developers.

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:14.670
Wow.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.670
There's so many of us on screen now.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.670
[laughter]

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.670
Okay.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.670
Like we were saying we had this exact discussion
about 'My Profile' and---

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.670
&gt;&gt;Adam: Do we want to look at that?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.980
I think that we had some other elements or
do we want to move on straight to

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980
"does it play music?"

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.850
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's look at this first and then
we'll go on to--"will it play music?"

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:30.209
next because I'm sure we need to keep
something there as a suspense for our users,

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:31.209
does it play music?

00:11:31.209 --> 00:11:32.209
&gt;&gt;Adam: This is true.

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:35.389
&gt;&gt;Reto: So my opinion with 'My Profile' seemed
like the kind of thing that should go on the

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:36.389
overflow menu.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:37.740
It's
like, how often are you going to change it?

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.110
With any kind of social networking, you do
your profile once and you're

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.110
kind of done.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.110
You disagree.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.110
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, I--

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: And at the time we hadn't logged in
so...

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.180
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.180
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, it's hard to say.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.350
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well I thought there was especially
a defense for an app like this that aims to

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.589
make your music a bit more
social, a bit more of a connected experience.

00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:57.224
So I thought that that decision reflected
[whoosh of bottle opening]

00:11:57.224 --> 00:11:58.740
on where they wanted this app to go.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:03.709
&gt;&gt;Reto: So basically you're saying if the
whole point is to make it more of a social

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:06.639
song experience then it sort of
makes sense to have that social media stuff

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.839
front and center.

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:08.839
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:13.579
&gt;&gt;Reto: So in fact, if we go in, we can see
that it really is, it's more than just who

00:12:13.579 --> 00:12:17.009
are you and what's your
current status, you can add personal messages,

00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:20.549
list your top songs, your top artists--so
it's really stuff which is

00:12:20.549 --> 00:12:21.549
going to change--

00:12:21.549 --> 00:12:22.549
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:23.549
&gt;&gt;Reto:-- on almost a daily basis, right?

00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.589
So I guess in summary we're saying, yeah,
fair enough.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:28.980
And they've got all
of this soc--basically this 'My Profile" is

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.829
just a way into the more social experience
of the app.

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:36.910
Though I have to
say that the styling of this section could

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.429
do with something of a revamp.

00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:40.429
Feels a little old.

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:42.879
Feels a little you know static-y , absolute
lay out-y almost.

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:48.519
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well it is using the Holo style buttons
and such, but I think that it's --it sort

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:49.649
of forms this grid of
gray--

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:50.649
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:52.600
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's a little bit difficult visually
get away from.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.999
&gt;&gt;Adam: I think that some icons--er--some
other splashes of color on this screen--

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:57.999
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:12:57.999 --> 00:12:59.029
&gt;&gt;Adam:--could really liven things up a little
bit.

00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:03.660
&gt;&gt;Reto:This is the thing, I've spent entirely
too much of my life, before joining Android,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.779
writing applications in
Cshell.net format for financial organizations

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:12.249
so I've seen far too many of these screens
which are just ranges of

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:19.480
gray buttons on lighter gray backgrounds so--maybe
it's just a hind brain thing that just sets

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.480
me off but--

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.480
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's entirely fair.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.519
I'd like it to look a little bit prettier,
particularly considering that the rest of

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.519
the app is styled.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.310
Like, you've obviously got a designer here
creating these, you know, very strong visual

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.939
graphics and so it'd be great
to see that sort of promoted throughout the

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:34.240
entire app.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.910
Do we want to have a look to see if it plays
any music?

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.910
[pause]

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.679
&gt;&gt;Adam: I don't know that sounds a little
bit daring.

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:42.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: I know, but at some point we're going
to have to run this apps really through their

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360
paces.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.360
&gt;&gt;Adam: Let's give it a shot.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let's take a look.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.540
&gt;&gt;Adam: So let's take a look at our music.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:52.419
So we jump into what's at this point a fairly
standard list of tracks.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:56.899
We
noticed that again the view pager title indicator

00:13:56.899 --> 00:13:59.589
gives us a simple indication of some of the
other functions that

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:01.549
exist just off screen.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:02.549
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:05.600
&gt;&gt;Adam: We have a streaming radio built in,
via SHOUTcast that's [unintelligible]

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is really nice.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.419
And this is something that me and Ian actually
called out for podcast players that we

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:16.471
would like to see a media player which has
both live--you know, our own audio we can

00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:20.149
listen to and also having live
streaming radio type functionality, so this

00:14:20.149 --> 00:14:21.410
is a big plus for me.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.359
It kind of takes account of two different
apps in

00:14:23.359 --> 00:14:24.359
one place.

00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:25.359
&gt;&gt;Adam: Absolutely.

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:27.939
&gt;&gt;Reto: I have to say though, I found it a
little bit hidden, because if we go back to

00:14:27.939 --> 00:14:30.040
the main menu it's 'My Music'
right?

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.819
So I'm expecting this is where I go to listen
to things that are already in my library.

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:34.819
And it's not until--

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:36.929
&gt;&gt;Adam: It gives it a little bit of this 'My
Computer'--

00:14:36.929 --> 00:14:37.929
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:14:37.929 --> 00:14:39.619
&gt;&gt;Adam: --nineties feel to it in that case.

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:40.619
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:42.220
And really what we're just saying is Music.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.249
So it would be much nicer there and being
able to have

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:49.930
the streaming stuff more readily available
and readily apparent I think would be a real

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.930
plus.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.930
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.429
So, next we get into some of the things on
the library screen here.

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:57.251
The 'shuffle all', 'show all songs' and 'show
all

00:14:57.251 --> 00:15:00.369
albums' elements here are really tiny touch
targets.

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:01.369
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:03.720
&gt;&gt;Adam: I mean, these things are probably
under 40 DP tall.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.449
Generally we try and go at least 48 in both
dimensions to

00:15:07.449 --> 00:15:11.749
try and get a nice, happy touch target, so
it's easy to hit.

00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:12.749
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:14.189
&gt;&gt;Adam: So it would be nice if those were
a little bit bigger.

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:17.529
I definitely can see wanting to break it up
and still

00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:21.579
see a little bit more of the content and still
separate it out from the songs themselves

00:15:21.579 --> 00:15:22.579
a little bit--

00:15:22.579 --> 00:15:23.579
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:25.730
&gt;&gt;Adam: But I think that the icons and some
other styling could be used to help with that

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.730
as well.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:27.730
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.839
I mean, there's a few options you've got here.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:34.320
Personally this as sort of three touch targets
all a bit bigger with sort of icons with text

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.740
underneath or something along those lines.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.740
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's an option.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.240
&gt;&gt;Reto: But something certainly easier to
touch.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.359
Every time someone tries to touch something
and feels like they're

00:15:40.359 --> 00:15:44.169
going to miss or touches the wrong thing,
it's kind of a bad experience for your users

00:15:44.169 --> 00:15:47.679
so you want to, you know,
avoid that if at all possible.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:48.679
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:49.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: All right.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:50.679
Lyle Lovett.

00:15:50.679 --> 00:15:51.679
Let's have a look.

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:52.929
Songs and Albums.

00:15:52.929 --> 00:15:55.279
So again we go through here, we've got the
album

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:57.869
covers at this points along with the names
and everything else.

00:15:57.869 --> 00:15:58.869
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's right.

00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:01.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: We've got touch targets on the end--see
this is--

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.880
&gt;&gt;Adam: So this was something that stood out
while we were testing this as well.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.540
&gt;&gt;Adam: We have the secondary touch targets
along this list items, very similar to what

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.939
Google Play Music has, but
you'll notice that these don't actually have

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:16.169
any sort of a press highlight that's readily
visible or if it does, it's

00:16:16.169 --> 00:16:17.569
very very subtle.

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:22.170
Again, that's just one of those small polish
type of elements, but it is responsive.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.249
I haven't
actually managed to miss that touch target,

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.249
yet.

00:16:25.249 --> 00:16:27.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: It looks like it's the right size,
you just don't know that you're touching it.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:28.930
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.329
It would be nice to see a little bit more
of a visual confirmation as well.

00:16:31.329 --> 00:16:35.689
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's also worth noting as well, it's
almost a contradiction in styles here.

00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:39.350
Where in the config menu, we've
got the right facing caret and here we've

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:44.399
got the sort of bottom right corner caret
indicating a drop down menu.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.160
I
think it's probably clear to most users how

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.839
those are different but it kind of highlights
that in Android clicking on

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:54.939
something means navigate to or perform that
action and anything else you've got on the

00:16:54.939 --> 00:16:58.730
right is sort of an in place
context menu if you will.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.470
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.419
So should we actually try and play some music?

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:03.509
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's try, yeah.

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:05.400
Make sure that the volume control works.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.709
So this is good, we're actually adjusting
the

00:17:07.709 --> 00:17:11.130
volume control of the media stream rather
than the ringer.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.759
Even though we're not playing music so that's
important.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:17.299
I'm going to mute that so "The Man" doesn't
get us.

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:20.780
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well it's always great to make sure
that you can adjust that volume before you

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.780
actually start playing.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.780
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.770
&gt;&gt;Adam: No one wants to get blasted by music
the second they hit the play button.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:26.770
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly right.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:28.770
Or miss the start if the audio is too low.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:29.770
&gt;&gt;Adam: Also true.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: Just as bad.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.230
Okay.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:37.220
Which title which looks, you know, kind of
like an innuendo should we go with?

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.870
'Lyle Lovett and His Large--' or 'It's Not
Big It's Large ?'

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.309
Let's go with '--and His Large'

00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:44.309
&gt;&gt;Adam: Band.

00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:45.309
&gt;&gt;Reto: BAND!

00:17:45.309 --> 00:17:46.759
Of course, that's what you were all thinking.

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:52.210
Okay, so again we've navigate down through
the albums, and now we go through to the song,

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.830
and it all works.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.750
So it's
instrumental so you can see here kind of one

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:02.110
of the key selling points of TuneWiki--is
that it will allow you to

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.990
view the lyrics of songs if they happen to
be in the library.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: And not only that, but it follows
a very karaoke scrolling mechanism for each

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:15.409
line in the song so as the song
plays, it scrolls forward and shows the current

00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:16.409
lyrics.

00:18:16.409 --> 00:18:17.540
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's see if we can find one.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.540
Uh--let's see.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:23.870
We might have more likelihood of having lyrics
for--so you can

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.450
see that the lyrics are loading up, it gets
uh--that's been pulled--

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.529
&gt;&gt;Adam: At the publisher's request--

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:30.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: You can see that as it's sort of pulling
down making that request you got a little

00:18:30.679 --> 00:18:34.169
flashy in that box it
feels like you could probably do all of that

00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:37.220
stuff like do all the caching, all the checking,
do all that offline

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.769
before you start updating the UI so that you
kind of get away from that, you know, things

00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:42.769
flashing.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:45.779
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true, especially when you have
a local music library that's not going to

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:48.700
change terribly often, or
when it does, you know that you're re-indexing

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.000
and that you have some new content.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.080
Here you can see exactly what we're talking
about.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.639
You’ll slowly eventually start to see the
lyrics start to move as the song continues

00:18:57.639 --> 00:18:58.639
to play.

00:18:58.639 --> 00:19:00.970
Ian, did you want to sing along for us?

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.049
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, I don't sing The Clash.

00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:05.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah.

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:07.519
You should have checked on this beforehand.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:09.309
Otherwise, it works pretty well.

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:12.539
One thing that you may want to be a little
bit cautious of, and I think it's okay in

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:17.059
this app but just a general piece of advice,
you've got some pretty small touch targets

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:21.220
along the bottom to control
the music playback right next to the ad.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.600
Now there are some ad policies around making
sure that you don't have action targets where

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.789
they could accidentally
result in an ad click.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:33.309
I think the general way that music players
are constructed is there is an expectation

00:19:33.309 --> 00:19:35.210
that
that's where the playback controls will be--

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.210
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: But, you know, it's definitely something
to be cautious of here.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.990
Particularly because these are all a little
bit small, particularly when you get to things

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.880
like random and repeat, you know, the icons
themselves are quite

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.649
little and immediately next to the ad.

00:19:48.649 --> 00:19:52.360
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right and keep in mind, it doesn't
necessarily matter how large the icon is.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.350
It matters how large the touch
target itself is.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.360
How easy is it to really miss.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.360
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.179
&gt;&gt;Adam: So you can see as we go into press
this--once again this is actually fairly small

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.860
but it is separated out
from the ad as well so I think that in terms

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.160
of being too close to the ad, that's not too
much of a problem.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.929
Oh, my
head's in the frame.

00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:08.929
[Reto laughs]

00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:13.490
In terms of being too close to the ad, that's
not much of a problem but it might be a little

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.279
bit easy to miss those
depending on--

00:20:15.279 --> 00:20:16.279
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:20:16.279 --> 00:20:18.200
&gt;&gt;Adam: Depending on how you're using it.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: And how big your fingers are.

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:20.559
&gt;&gt;Adam: All but true.

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:23.950
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we can scroll along here so while
we're listening to a particular artist you

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.539
can see we've got more
information about the group, there's this

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:29.299
whole community aspect that we talked about
before, and so you can see

00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:33.889
other people who have shared this music or
are fans of The Clash.

00:20:33.889 --> 00:20:36.269
So this is where it gets a little bit interesting.

00:20:36.269 --> 00:20:40.150
We discussed this a little beforehand but
basically all of the

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.029
sharing options that you have within the app
are tightly bound to Facebook and Twitter.

00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:48.509
Now they're probably two of
the most popular mechanisms for social sharing

00:20:48.509 --> 00:20:50.570
but then, they're not the only ones and as
it happens, on this phone

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.710
we have neither of these apps installed because
we want to share things other ways.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.900
And so, you know, you've got
basically this app which you want people to

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.389
promote for you, and I can't promote them
on G-plus, I can't promote them

00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:06.590
via email or anything else because I can only
use these two things.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.289
So we'd really like to see you sort of using
a

00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:12.929
more standard share intent or send intent
so that any app that I've got on the app that

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:16.049
I use for sharing can be used
to get this information out there.

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:20.370
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right and just because you use this--just
because we recommend the standard android

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:23.120
sharing doesn't mean that
you can't do some deeper integration with

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.390
some of these other specific SDK's but in
the case of this app, if you go

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.590
to the specific share action that's here,
we get something that's once again very very

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.320
tailored to these two
networks such that it's not actually possible

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.620
to share any other way.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:39.960
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.310
&gt;&gt;Adam: Either that or we missed that functionality
somewhere buried---

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: And if we missed it, it's kind of
too buried and that's kind of the key, right?

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.090
You want to make it
something which people can get to.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:52.139
So you go through the overflow menu, that's
all great so now--actually I'm gonna

00:21:52.139 --> 00:21:53.139
scroll back to this song as it continues to
play.

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:55.290
&gt;&gt;Adam: So I just want to point out some of
the other features that they include in the

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.070
overflow menu that are kind
of interesting.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.370
&gt;&gt;Adam: They do have some really convenient
things like 'keep screen on' and again this

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.529
could be useful for the
karaoke style lyrics--

00:22:02.529 --> 00:22:03.529
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:06.539
&gt;&gt;Adam: You’ve got 'set as ringtone' which
is always convenient.

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:09.759
You've got 'start a sleep timer' in case you've
got

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:12.049
a long playlist that you want to shut off
after a while--

00:22:12.049 --> 00:22:13.049
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nice.

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:14.049
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's a fairly feature full app.

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:16.809
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely and I think that's something
that we definitely decided when we were looking

00:22:16.809 --> 00:22:20.260
at this was that as
far as music playing apps go, this has kind

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.059
of everything you could ask for and most of
what we're pointing out here

00:22:23.059 --> 00:22:27.730
is relatively minor UI tweaks sort of things
you can do to make the app a little bit cleaner,

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.769
a little bit more
polished but I think, overall, we're really

00:22:30.769 --> 00:22:31.769
really happy with this.

00:22:31.769 --> 00:22:34.070
I think this is a great example.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.630
So let's check out a couple more things.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:40.019
So we're playing audio at the moment, if we
turn on turn off--try that

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:45.929
again--so unfortunately no lock screen controls
now this kind of sucks because for me--a big

00:22:45.929 --> 00:22:50.110
use case for me is while
I'm driving so I want to be able to get to

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.730
those controls really quickly and easily without
having to look at my

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:56.559
phone at all like, I only, of course, will
be doing this while I'm stopped but even still,

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.690
I don't want to play with
my phone and unlock it.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.039
I have a PIN unlock and all those sorts of
things.

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:06.590
Makes it more tiresome, I just want to be
able to unlock--turn on screen and hit skip

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.669
basically for it to do its thing.

00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:14.080
If we look in the notification--we've got
the notification there so it's here, but we

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.940
don't have the controls in
notification either which again it's a bit

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.960
painful--means I need to navigate into the
app to be able to control it.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.210
And we also see that it hasn't actually navigated
me to--directly to the lyrics page.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.500
But I guess there's no need,
right?

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.500
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.500
It's still on the [unintelligible]

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.230
&gt;&gt;Reto: Anything here that lets me hit pause
is probably sufficient.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:32.230
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:37.429
We also have what seems to be a bit of a legacy
FROYO style notification icon in the status

00:23:37.429 --> 00:23:40.149
bar here
as well with the gradient frame around it.

00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:41.149
It's a minor--

00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:42.149
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:43.149
Cool.

00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:44.940
Should we have a quick look at the playback
on the tablet as well.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.129
I'm just curious to see
whether the experience on the tablet sort

00:23:48.129 --> 00:23:49.570
of lives up to the phone version.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.570
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: While you're going over to that, let
me break in for just a second.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:59.110
There's a couple things--oh, there's two
of you-- the couple of things that I wanted

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.610
to bring up, first, that apparently TuneWiki
is a massively complex

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:08.120
program that deserves its own hour of work
because you're still talking about it half

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.769
an hour after the show has
started.

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:10.769
[Reto laughs]

00:24:10.769 --> 00:24:12.259
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's true, we probably should move
on.

00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:16.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Most importantly though, we actually
did get a comment on the G-plus stream last

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.049
night from Rafael Szuminski
who I think has a really good question, he

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:25.129
asks, "if you have time, can you please go
into detail and explain the behavior of the

00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:28.380
up
navigation versus the back button in the play

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.530
music apps, specifically how is it affected
by different entry points

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.530
into the app?"

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:37.870
So when you guys get a chance, as you're looking
at the action bar, I think a lot of people

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:41.519
would
like to have a better explanation of up versus

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.519
back.

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:46.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: And happily we have the right person
in the room because Adam gave a talk about

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.760
this very subject at Google
IO this year.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760
&gt;Adam: Oh.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Did he invent the word 'affordance'?

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.760
&gt;&gt;Reto: I hope so.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: 'Cause I'm still confused by that,
so--

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760
&gt;&gt;Adam: No.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.760
No, not at all.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Okay.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.840
&gt;&gt;Reto: You're not willing to take blame slash
credit for 'affordance'?

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840
No?

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840
All right.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.960
&gt;&gt;Adam: I don't think so.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.510
So we can definitely go ahead and include
links not only to the design guide on the

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.130
topic of up versus back but also
to the talk that we gave at IO for that topic

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.130
as well.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.149
I think that it, depending on some of the
complex cases that

00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:17.429
you can get into, it can get somewhat sophisticated
although I think that there's a few overarching

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:20.499
guidelines that
tend to dominate.

00:25:20.499 --> 00:25:21.499
&gt;&gt;Reto: Cool.

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:25.010
Well as we go through these other apps, we'll
see if there's an opportunity, because you're

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.830
absolutely
right we should move on.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:30.640
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right, and in the interest of time
as well, I know that we were going to look

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.000
at the Tablet UI on some of
these.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.960
&gt;&gt;Adam: But by and large, I think that music
apps are the sort of apps that--it's used

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.919
to replace pocket MP3 players
in many cases.

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:41.919
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:46.470
&gt;&gt;Adam: I mean it's entirely reasonable to
really focus on the experience on a phone

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.149
for a music app, so--

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:49.149
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:53.950
&gt;&gt;Adam: We'll go ahead and call out when an
application did a particularly good job of

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.999
providing a tablet UI in
addition to the phone experience--

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:56.999
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:58.324
&gt;&gt;Adam: But in the interest of time maybe
we should skip it for now.

00:25:58.324 --> 00:25:59.679
&gt;&gt;Reto: We should move on.

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:02.150
Let's have a look at--actually, let's have
a look at a few of these together.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.159
We'll check
out XenoAmp, XenoAmp, and probably XenoAmp

00:26:05.159 --> 00:26:06.159
at the same time?

00:26:06.159 --> 00:26:07.159
&gt;&gt;Adam: Okay, I think that might save some
time there.

00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:08.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think that makes sense.

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.429
Okay, cool.

00:26:09.429 --> 00:26:11.220
So let's switch to the phone.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.559
We've cleared data so we can start from scratch.

00:26:13.559 --> 00:26:15.480
All right, perfect.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.379
&gt;&gt;Adam: First off, I think that we might have
a bit of a trademark issue on this.

00:26:19.379 --> 00:26:26.309
It looks like the XenoAmp has used
the Nexus X four color iconography in its

00:26:26.309 --> 00:26:27.309
app icon.

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:28.309
&gt;&gt;Reto: [sharp intake of breath] Mmm, yeah.

00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:30.860
So you want to watch that so maybe choose
a different logo that doesn't

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.650
quite infringe on another trademark.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:34.929
Let's fire it up.

00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:40.399
So it's warning us that this is an early version
and we need to turn off our firewall or disable

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:41.399
it for XenoAmp.

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:42.980
[clicks tongue]
Yeah.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.509
I don't know that that's the first thing you
want to be telling people to inspire confidence,

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:50.769
like you know,
"Remove security precautions so that our app

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:51.820
can do stuff."

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.539
I don't know that makes me a little nervous.

00:26:53.539 --> 00:26:56.679
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's slightly sketchy, although they
do have a nice playful voice with this, with

00:26:56.679 --> 00:26:58.490
their 'yeah yeah' button
instead of an 'okay'.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: And these kind of goes throughout
the whole app which are quite nice, and so

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.590
[claps hands together] we're
going to go right off the bat and point out

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.019
that this is clearly an early version and
so we're gonna--it's definitely

00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:12.559
something we're going to look at--but in line
with the playful attitude of the developers,

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:15.240
we're going to take a
similar attitude, I think, in looking at this

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.340
app and hopefully you guys will take it in
the spirit it was intended.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:25.940
So, this is where we start, with authentication
failure.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.070
'Touch me here stopped.'

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.169
So I touch here, and nothing
happens.

00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:31.710
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well something's lighting up there.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:32.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: So there is something.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.039
&gt;&gt;Adam: So if we touch and hold here--okay--

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:36.039
&gt;&gt;Reto: Okay.

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:38.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: Now we've got something that starts
resembling a UI.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.409
&gt;&gt;Reto: So let go so we can see what else
to press.

00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:41.409
&gt;&gt;Adam: All right.

00:27:41.409 --> 00:27:42.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Nope, now it's fading away.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.600
&gt;&gt;Adam: Fading away.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.039
So the first thing that I notice--

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.039
&gt;&gt;Reto: Ah!

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:49.720
&gt;&gt;Adam:--with this app is not only do they
hide the status bar, but then they create

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.720
their own.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:55.630
So XenoAmp has its
own clock and its title is occupying the space

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.860
where notifications would normally be, along
with what looks to be a

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.860
battery read out.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.340
&gt;&gt;Reto:Yeah,and so okay, so to be clear, we
spend a lot of time, and I think I in particular

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.460
have spent a lot of time
online talking about how I hate it when apps

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.830
hide the status bar because you know I use
the status bar to see what

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.760
time it is, to see how much battery I've got
left.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.950
The solution I was looking for was not to
just put the time and

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:21.889
the battery into your own fake status bar--I
was kind of just using those as examples--leave

00:28:21.889 --> 00:28:22.929
the status bar.

00:28:22.929 --> 00:28:24.630
Unless
you're just sort of consuming content that's

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.150
supposed to be immersive, there's really no
reason to take that away.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.269
&gt;&gt;Adam: So there was one exception to that
actually.

00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:31.269
&gt;&gt;Reto: Please.

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:35.299
&gt;Adam: You'll notice this in a lot of apps--is
that if you go into landscape mode--landscape

00:28:35.299 --> 00:28:38.249
mode you're very
constrained for that vertical real estate--so

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:41.749
a lot of times it makes sense to hide the
status bar in landscape but

00:28:41.749 --> 00:28:45.779
still bring it back in portrait so that if
the user needs to get back to their notifications

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:49.259
so on and so forth, they
can simply rotate the device and get it back.

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:51.520
In this case, this app offers neither.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:56.519
&gt;&gt;Reto: All right, so let's continue to touch--see,
I'm touching the wrong place 'cause I can't

00:28:56.519 --> 00:28:57.519
get that--oop--there
we go.

00:28:57.519 --> 00:28:58.519
So I need to drag--

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.519
&gt;&gt;Adam: You need to start sliding around.

00:28:59.519 --> 00:29:03.009
&gt;&gt;Reto: So I need to move in order to get
things and so again, none of these is entirely

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:06.330
clear what I need to do to
listen to stuff.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.330
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, we could try music down at the
bottom.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:08.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: But I guess music makes sense.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.799
So if I drag down to music, then I get this
kind of wacky display.

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:16.259
Now it's
clear that whoever has put this together has

00:29:16.259 --> 00:29:19.840
some, I'm guessing, open GL skills?

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.780
But this list view is kind of
surreal in that--

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.650
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's clearly not a list view just
in the way that it behaves.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.309
It doesn't follow the same sort of fling
physics--

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:31.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: The fling physics are phenomenal,
it's almost like --just sort of accelerates.

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:35.309
So I start a little and
straightaway it shoots up and seems to just

00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:38.659
want to keep going like it's in some sort
of anti-gravity well.

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:40.580
Which is kind of cool.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.330
And then I can move these thing around but
it's not really clear to what purpose.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.249
See, it was
just going off screen beforehand, but it isn't

00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:49.309
happening now, but--

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:54.749
&gt;&gt;Adam: I think this is meant to get to different
albums within a certain artist's catalog--

00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:58.559
but why you're able to
scroll this one when all of it would fit on

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:01.570
screen and there's only one album available--ehhhhh,
it's maybe

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:02.570
questionable.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.139
&gt;&gt;Reto: You're just kind of wondering what
is the--you know, I'm touching things and

00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:07.929
everything's moving and I'm not
really sure why and how.

00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:08.929
Oop.

00:30:08.929 --> 00:30:09.929
There I guess.

00:30:09.929 --> 00:30:10.929
The Jimmy Smith is gone.

00:30:10.929 --> 00:30:12.210
I think I can get him back--

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.210
&gt;&gt;Adam: Maybe not.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.210
&gt;&gt;Reto: Maybe not.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.659
So I'll have to come back.

00:30:15.659 --> 00:30:21.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, one thing to notice on the,
on that scrolling list view is that that actually

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:28.940
does look a lot like
what you'd see with our default physics, if

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:32.269
you don't know the magic numbers to plug in
to scale it.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:33.269
&gt;&gt;Reto: Is that right?

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:34.269
&gt;&gt;Ian: Uh, yeah.

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:36.940
Yeah, if you look at the class that I wrote
on custom controls--

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.940
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm Hmm.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: You'll actually see that I actually
had to plug in a couple magic numbers that

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:46.450
I pulled out of a Speed code base
to make sure that the physics scaled correctly

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.999
and didn't feel like they were too fast.

00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:48.999
&gt;&gt;Adam: Really, all right.

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:54.070
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's an Android U class you've
got at, let's see, developer@android.com/training?

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.740
And it's called
"Building Custom Views?"

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: It is called, yeah, something like
"Building Custom views," "Making Custom Views",

00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:59.970
something like that.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:00.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: Cool.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.450
We'll paste that link into the G-plus stream
I think, and check that out.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sounds wonderful.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.750
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, and in a spirit of a BETA, we
also have our FPS counter up in the corner

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.750
there that's uh---

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's right.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.309
You probably can't quite see it, but that's
what this number here is.

00:31:11.309 --> 00:31:14.259
Which is running at a
pretty decent sort of twenty-nine to thirty?

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:16.899
&gt;&gt;Adam: Thirty-ish, until you actually start
scrolling at which point--

00:31:16.899 --> 00:31:19.470
&gt;&gt;Reto:No, it's still staying up around thirty.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.090
&gt;&gt;Adam: It gets down--it gets down here and
there but--

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.330
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's not bad.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.970
&gt;&gt;Adam: They're tracking performance which
is good at a phase of development like this.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:27.970
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's good.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.389
So let's actually navigate in and try and
play an album.

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.899
So we've got this album, and again, everything
is this nice

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:35.179
slide-y, scroll-y view.

00:31:35.179 --> 00:31:40.220
It looks really cool, if a little impenetrable
in terms of navigation, because we're here

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:46.210
now and I'm not really clear where we are--there's
no action bar, there's no sort of obvious

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.440
navigation, I can bring
up this weird sort of slider-y thing which

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.580
is kind of like my navigation-y thing and
I can move stuff around but it's

00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.019
not entirely clear what I'm doing or why these
things are moving.

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:03.519
&gt;&gt;Adam: So, if we try to drill in on this--

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:05.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: See, nothing happens.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.570
&gt;&gt;Adam: Then select something.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.419
&gt;&gt;Reto: So what you guys can't tell, which
we can tell is that this is actually failing

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:15.220
the first test--we can't
figure out how to make it play music.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.750
Pressing this, selecting this does nothing.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.820
There's no sort of play affordance, see I
love that word.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:22.820
&gt;&gt;Adam: Now wait, now we have it on a list--

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.130
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's here on a list--

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: Have we added this to a playlist at
this point?

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.809
&gt;&gt;Reto: I think so, but I don't know how to
make the playlist play.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:33.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: You just said my pet peeve, which is
playlist, you know I have nothing against

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.519
playlist per se, but
when you're required to put something on a

00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:42.029
playlist before you freakin' play it--that's
wrong.

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:45.659
You shouldn't have to
set things up before you do what the app is

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:46.659
meant to do.

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:47.659
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:32:47.659 --> 00:32:48.659
This is--

00:32:48.659 --> 00:32:51.639
&gt;&gt;Ian: We discussed this in podcast players
and went nuts on it then, this is even worse.

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:52.639
[laughter]

00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:53.639
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:57.200
I totally agree--it fails that fundamental
rule which is you should be able to start

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.630
doing
whatever the point of the app is with as few--

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.630
[music starts playing]

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: OH.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:02.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh you found a way!

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:03.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: We started playing music.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:04.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: Outstanding!

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.630
How?

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Crap!

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.630
Now The Man's gonna cut us off.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's a good question.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: We have four seconds.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: We got it closed down.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.630
[laughter]

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:13.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: How did you do this Adam?

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:14.630
While we, me--

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's a good question.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:16.630
&gt;&gt;Reto: And Ian were talking shit you managed
to play music.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:17.970
&gt;&gt;Adam:I'm going to assume, right.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.980
I think the core issue about this app is really
discoverability.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.980
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mmm.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.169
&gt;Adam: I think that they've got this really
interesting UI that they are putting together

00:33:26.169 --> 00:33:30.549
something that is clearly
meant to be operated using fingers, using

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:31.940
gestures.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.899
It seems like they might be onto something
really interesting--

00:33:33.899 --> 00:33:34.919
&gt;&gt;Reto: Mm hmm.

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:37.919
&gt;&gt;Adam: But you can really end up spending
a lot of time with this app without it being

00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:42.210
entirely obvious how to
perform basic functions that you may be familiar

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.530
with from other music apps.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.450
I think that's kind of the key here and so
it--and this is something which I think Ian

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.139
and
myself have spoken about particularly in--hopefully

00:33:52.139 --> 00:33:55.880
he'll agree with me--you don't have to make
an app that looks

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.289
like every other android app.

00:33:57.289 --> 00:34:00.159
Doesn't have to have an action bar, doesn't
have to have to have list views, like

00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:04.450
something like what they've done here to create
something quite radically different is actually

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:05.639
kind of cool.

00:34:05.639 --> 00:34:07.769
You
know, we like apps which are innovative and

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:09.750
change the way you expect things to happen
--

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:10.750
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: But--

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.440
&gt;&gt;Adam: And music apps have long been the
source of this sort of innovation--

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.250
&gt;&gt;Adam:-- and a number of different operating
systems and I mean you can think back to the

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.179
early '90's where had
things that looked like car stereos on your

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:22.550
desktops and so on and so forth.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.550
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:26.330
It was the whole skinning community about
WinAmp which no one nominated this week so

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:27.679
we're not
going to look at it, but that was kind of

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.349
the whole point of WinAmp was to get all these
cool different custom

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:32.349
looking UI's--

00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:33.349
&gt;&gt;Adam: Exactly.

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:34.349
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is kind of cool.

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:38.159
&gt;&gt;Adam: So if there's ever a place to experiment
like this, a music or media player app is

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.159
really kind of a great
fertile ground for doing so.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:41.159
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:45.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: I actually feel like I could find myself
totally loving this app, like it could become

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.179
my favorite music
player.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.760
Partly just because, I think what they're
doing, now I could be wrong, but I think what

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.899
they're doing with
the UI is making it easy to operate without

00:34:54.899 --> 00:34:55.960
really looking at it.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.849
You know, I'm just going to touch it in a
really

00:34:58.849 --> 00:35:03.710
predictable place in the middle of the screen
on a target that's gigantic and then I'm just

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.460
going to slide my finger
one way or the other right?

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.599
Not right now, because it's not working, but
seemed like you might be able to.

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:13.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, this is part of the navigation
issue that we see now.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.960
Now that the various things come up, and so
I

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.270
guess that's really it, it's just--

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.619
&gt;&gt;Adam: It almost seems like perhaps we're
running into bugs at that point.

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:23.569
&gt;&gt;Reto: It could well be and I think, if that's
what you guys are trying to do, I think that's

00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:26.119
great like and maybe
you're just suffering from that eighty-twenty

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:29.569
rule where it's eighty percent of the way
there, you've got all the

00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:33.160
functionality; you've got all the navigation
but twenty percent that remains to be done

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.390
is the bit that makes it
actually impossible to navigate if you don't

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.900
know the magic things to press.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's right.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.640
&gt;&gt;Reto: And that's why it's really important
that you get people to BETA test your apps

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.670
and really watch to see how
they use them.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.839
Because I'm sure if the developer for this
app were standing behind us, he'd be like.

00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:48.309
"No, no, no.

00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:49.869
You just have to press here and then here.

00:35:49.869 --> 00:35:50.910
Why are you pressing over there?

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:51.910
Why are you dragging that?

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:52.910
Why are you
pressing the back button?"

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:55.670
&gt;&gt;Adam: BETA testing is really an illuminating
experience.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.750
&gt;&gt;Reto: It really is.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.880
&gt;&gt;Adam: When you're sitting behind a glass
where they can't see you [Reto laughs], you

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.920
just want to jump through
and--

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: Pound on the glass, "Why?!?!?"

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:06.250
Yeah, and this is why testers are really valuable.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.260
Us engineering folks, we have this tendency
to know how it works

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.780
and then do it the right way.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.930
And then you put it in front of testers and
they're like trying to press two buttons at

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.140
the same time.

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.920
"Why are you pressing okay and cancel at the
same time?

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.930
Why are you pressing okay like ten times in
a

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.270
row real quick?"

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.890
All these little bits and pieces when you
see people actually using your app, or testing

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.130
them,
trying to break them, is how you really get

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:31.150
that next stage polish to something which
people really love and are

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.150
excited about.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.150
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's right.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.369
So this app doesn't claim to be more than
a BETA at this point and I think that at this

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:38.369
point,
it's good.

00:36:38.369 --> 00:36:40.930
&gt;&gt;Reto:[Absolutely] I think at this point
it's really more of an Alpha just given that

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.609
it's just a little too hard to
use.

00:36:42.609 --> 00:36:43.880
It's a little too frustrating.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.710
I want to see you guys spend a little more
time building something that's just a

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:53.150
little bit more predictable before you spend
too much more effort getting it out there.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:57.609
&gt;&gt;Adam: Or at least start guiding the user
through the first time--that always makes

00:36:57.609 --> 00:36:58.609
it a little more--

00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:59.609
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:36:59.609 --> 00:37:00.950
All right, let's move on to the next app.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.589
Now, none of us have a Spotify account set
up right now.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:07.119
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, we tested this on some other
devices previously.

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:08.119
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:37:08.119 --> 00:37:11.099
Spotify in general, given that we're running
out of time a little bit here, I think it's

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:12.570
probably a
reasonable one to skip.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.040
It's a great app, fantastic functionality
and a pretty decent UI.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.950
And they've actually worked
pretty well in terms of getting some of the

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.750
newest features integrated.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.400
Things like widgets and universal search
they were building those sorts of things straight

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.069
off the bat so so check out Spotify it's pretty
cool, but we're

00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:30.150
going to skip past that one.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.430
&gt;&gt;Adam: One of the other things that we were
going to highlight in Spotify as well is that

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:37.490
they do use the ever
emerging pattern of the side drawer that slides

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:42.170
out from one side so I believe that the most
recent update to the

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.480
Android design guide has a few words to say
about that as well so--

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yes.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.480
It does.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480
&gt;&gt;Adam: Definitely go check that out if you're
interested.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's the big tip.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.619
Yeah, so definitely go check that out if you're
interested in the drawer pattern, do

00:37:49.619 --> 00:37:51.530
check out the new design site update.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.900
It has a whole section on that.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.490
The "too long didn't read" version, the way
YouTube does it, is pretty much spot on.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.339
So if you do want to know what is the right
way to implement that, that’s

00:38:00.339 --> 00:38:01.470
probably the right place to start.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.470
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's right.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.600
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let’s look at UberHype.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.220
[pause]

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.910
&gt;&gt;Adam: Powered by the hype machine.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: There's a lot of hype going on here.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:16.550
So you know again, this passes the test of
straightaway--you start up

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.510
the app, you have a list of music, you press
a music track--

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.890
&gt;&gt;Adam: And it actually does start playing--

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.450
&gt;&gt;Reto: It starts playing music.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.450
Which is perfect.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.200
It’s exactly what you want from an app--from
a music playing app.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.700
We go to the home screen, we can go down here,
I think that's, yeah, that's it's--

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.420
&gt;&gt;Adam: You can go back.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.420
It has back navigation.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.420
&gt;&gt;Reto: We can navigate here.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.220
Unfortunately, there's no ability to control
the playback from the notifications, which

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.250
is a bit of a disappointment.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.250
&gt;&gt;Adam: How 'bout the lock screen?

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:43.250
&gt;&gt;Reto: Let's try the lock screen.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.460
Let's try the lock screen again.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.861
&gt;&gt;Adam: Oh, there we go.

00:38:46.861 --> 00:38:47.861
&gt;&gt;Reto: It does.

00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:48.861
How nice.

00:38:48.861 --> 00:38:49.861
So they have the lock screen integrate--

00:38:49.861 --> 00:38:50.861
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hold on wait a second.

00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:51.861
Was this the same song we were--

00:38:51.861 --> 00:38:52.861
&gt;&gt;Reto: Wait.

00:38:52.861 --> 00:38:53.861
&gt;&gt;Adam:--no I believe this was from one of
our earlier apps.

00:38:53.861 --> 00:38:55.950
I think that we still have the--is that XenoAmp
or one

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:56.950
of the other ones?

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:57.950
&gt;&gt;Reto: Could be one of the other ones which
is already running.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:00.810
&gt;&gt;Adam: Let's go ahead and clear these out
just to

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.890
[Reto laughs]
make sure that we're set here.

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.570
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:05.570
So let's go back to UberHype.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:08.680
&gt;&gt;Adam: We still have an indication sitting
up there in that corner.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680
[pause]

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.680
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680
&gt;&gt;Adam: Interesting.

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:12.680
[Reto laughs]

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.820
All right we may need to be a little more
aggressive for that one.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.820
&gt;&gt;Reto: All right.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.309
So that's another app that's behaving a little
less politely.

00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:20.309
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:25.880
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, so the music is there but unfortunately
not on the lock screen but it does mean that

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.930
they are probably not using the audio focus
quite correctly because that should clear

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.260
out any other app that's
playing.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.260
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's right.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:36.680
Let's just go ahead and kill this too to be
sure here--

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.990
&gt;&gt;Reto: What's confusing is it's what's playing
on the tablet.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.850
&gt;&gt;Adam: Ah, yeah that's true.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:42.990
[Reto laughs]

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:45.850
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah it was XenoAmp.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.589
So that works anyway on having the lock screen
controls.

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:51.700
&gt;&gt;Adam: [unintelligible] Okay.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.700
[pause]

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.220
So testing once again.

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.510
We don't, in fact, have lock screen controls.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Boo.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.510
Oh, I was so hopeful.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:59.510
&gt;&gt;Adam: Oh wait.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.510
Does it happen when we're playing perhaps?

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Maybe that helps.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:02.510
Let's have a look.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.510
No.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.510
&gt;&gt;Adam: Nope.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.510
We still have nothin'.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.510
[Reto laughs]

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:07.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Okay, so that's fine.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:08.630
You can heart things here, which is nice.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.630
Well, theoretically.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:10.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: Oh.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.470
&gt;&gt;Reto: So you need to be a member of the
HypeMachine for that.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.470
&gt;&gt;Adam: HypeMachine.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.329
&gt;&gt;Reto: And actually this is a pattern that
I actually quite like.

00:40:16.329 --> 00:40:17.890
Nothing gets hidden, nothing gets removed.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.180
If you
try and do something that requires a membership,

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.980
then you point it out and give people the
opportunity to join.

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.980
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:26.660
You wait until the last minute to require
that log in so that people can really make

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.500
that informed
decision whether or not they take that step

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.510
and want to create an account for your service.

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:35.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: I am going to make one--I've got one
thing to say about that heart button.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.319
Shouldn't that be a star button?

00:40:37.319 --> 00:40:41.740
&gt;&gt;Reto: Well, you know, it probably should,
but I guess it kind of depends on what they

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.880
mean by it, by the heart
button.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:48.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: If they're favoriting something for
their own sake, I think that star is a much

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:52.670
better metaphor, but if they
are favoriting it, as in promoting it to their

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:57.099
friends as something which they are enjoying,
the heart--it kind of almost

00:40:57.099 --> 00:40:58.099
makes more sense.

00:40:58.099 --> 00:40:59.099
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hmm.

00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:02.440
By the way, I noticed that when we're doing
this top to bottom thing, it totally doesn't

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.059
work to have us looking left
to right.

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:07.280
I think what we--yeah--what we want is to
be like this-- like 'Brady Bunch' style.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: What do you see?

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hey Reto, how's it going?

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280
&gt;&gt;Reto: This is weird.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.280
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hey.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280
LOVE it!

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280
[laughter]

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:21.210
Yeah, I'm just saying that you don't get to
pick your favorite, you know, 'Lucky Charms'

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.210
metaphor.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.210
There's a star

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.210
[Reto laughs]

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.410
for making something your favorite and the
heart means kind of nothing to the average

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.410
Android user.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.410
&gt;&gt;Reto: That's true.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.410
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, something to think about.

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:34.859
&gt;&gt;Adam: Well, for something that ties into
an existing service, if you already have a

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:38.559
metaphor for doing--performing
an action like this--then sometimes it makes

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:40.922
sense to stay consistent with the rest of
that service as well.

00:41:40.922 --> 00:41:42.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is a really good point, yeah.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: So we see that in this screen, we
actually have the menu button of shame.

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.680
It's there, it does nothing.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.630
Which
is particularly weird because we've got this

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.600
action bar type metaphor.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.370
While we're here, we'll also see what happens
when we hit the share button--we get the sharing

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:57.370
apps which is nice.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:58.370
&gt;&gt;Adam: [unintelligible].

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.370
&gt;&gt;Reto: So that's happy making.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.680
Now what's a little bit weirder is this icon
here which I have no idea what that

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.930
means--a sort of filter?

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:04.930
&gt;&gt;Adam: So great.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.520
&gt;&gt;Reto: It's an overflow button, right?

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:10.180
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's almost an overflow located in
the opposite position that you normally would

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180
expect an overflow button to
be.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.530
&gt;&gt;Reto: So it's kind of a right to left overflow,
and now it's weird, because if we've got an

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:16.720
overflow then we don't
need the menu button along the bottom.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.720
And if we go back--

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.559
&gt;&gt;Adam: This is another example of a non-standard
action bar as well.

00:42:21.559 --> 00:42:22.559
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:24.970
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's using just a little bit different
size for everything.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.049
Little bit different metrics, and it stands
out.

00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:31.460
&gt;&gt;Reto: And if we go back to the main menu--we
find out that here, the menu button isn't

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.609
a button of shame, but it is
confusing because everything in this is just

00:42:35.609 --> 00:42:38.880
as appropriate when you're listening to a
track as when you're looking

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.880
at list of tracks.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.319
&gt;&gt;Adam: And we do have one of your favorite
actions--[unintelligible]

00:42:41.319 --> 00:42:43.000
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exit button.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Yay!

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
NO!

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.190
There's no need for an exit button.

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:50.980
For a music playing app, as soon as you are
paused, that should be the equivalent of everything

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:52.960
stopping, there shouldn't be any services
running, there

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.359
shouldn't be any difference at that point
between hitting exit or just hitting back.

00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:01.170
That should be equivalent, so
then there's no need to put it in there because,

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:04.450
again, as soon as you have an exit button--I
understand that some

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:09.420
users like an exit button and it's a nice
thing to put in there but it's totally ambiguous.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.420
It's meaningless.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.440
You don't--no one actually knows what that
exit button is going to do--so putting it

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:17.530
there just runs the risk of
frustrating your users and annoying the hell

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:18.530
out of me.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.940
Let's go back in here.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.940
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:24.609
&gt;&gt;Reto: Splash screen every time we start
up again--is that really necessary?

00:43:24.609 --> 00:43:27.589
Like, you know, reticulating splines
here.

00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:30.869
You should just be able to start off and have
these things cached so that we get a nice

00:43:30.869 --> 00:43:32.549
clean quick startup
every time.

00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:36.070
&gt;&gt;Adam: Although I do have to say that if
you are loading something for the very first

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.520
time, showing something a
little more attractive than a loading spinner

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.530
I think that that gets points.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.530
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, I think so.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:44.750
I think the first time you load, you want
to have something and we have sort of preferences

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:48.569
around how much time you should be showing
a blank screen, i.e. no time.

00:43:48.569 --> 00:43:52.700
So definitely having a splash screen or
loading screen the first time is nice, but

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.930
everything after the first time, I feel like
you should already have that

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:57.710
data cached in a way that you can bring stuff
up quickly.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.960
&gt;&gt;Adam: And just to run through a couple of
other things very quickly before we move on--you'll

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.000
notice that we do
have the top tabs here to move between some

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.619
different elements, but we don't actually
have the ability to swipe

00:44:07.619 --> 00:44:11.620
between these--we do have sort of a long press
action, presented in a nicer way than your

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.660
standard pop up dialog.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah, that's reasonable.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.890
&gt;&gt;Adam: So as you flip between here, we do
get a short period of loading before we bring

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:18.890
it up.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.890
&gt;&gt;Reto: Yeah.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.890
A bit of pre-caching would be nice as well.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:21.890
There's a good chance that you're going to
hit these top

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:25.700
actions so after you've loaded the first one
and nothing else is happening, just pre-load

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:26.700
them in the background.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.700
&gt;&gt;Adam: Sounds good.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.700
&gt;&gt;Reto: And it would be relatively cheap.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.430
&gt;&gt;Adam: And if this was something that sits
in a view pager then suddenly the loader's

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.020
attached to different fragments
make that very easy to implement so on and

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.020
so forth.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.020
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020
Let's--

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.299
&gt;&gt;Adam: The other thing that sort of kind
of shows as well, is we have this bottom strip

00:44:41.299 --> 00:44:43.220
on each one of these pages
as well.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.869
It's kind of like a second set of tabs, kind
of not.

00:44:46.869 --> 00:44:47.869
Is it more of a filter?

00:44:47.869 --> 00:44:49.430
Is it from different sources?

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:53.829
We can go for Twitter over here as well--
so this is something that always sort of bothers

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:58.670
me in apps, when you try to
sandwich different levels of hierarchy on

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.180
opposite sides of the content.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.500
I think it makes it more difficult to tell
where you're drilling down into that hierarchy

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.500
so on and so forth.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:07.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.040
&gt;&gt;Adam: And in this app in particular, you
have a very small touch target for these bottom

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:13.600
tabs that sits right next
to the capacitive buttons for navigation,

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.480
even on devices that don't use the soft navigation.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.480
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:21.380
A couple of other points really quickly before
we jump on the lightning round for the last

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.640
two apps in
two minutes.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.610
We're using a non-standard font here?

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.010
And Roman's not here, so he can't go on at
length about

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.350
typography.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.839
It's a nice font.

00:45:29.839 --> 00:45:32.950
But it is a little disconcerting maybe?

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.299
Just having that different that font style
here, I don't know that it entirely works,

00:45:36.299 --> 00:45:37.299
but--

00:45:37.299 --> 00:45:39.549
&gt;&gt;Adam: It looks like it might be part of
their brand for the rest of the service they

00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:40.549
hold so--

00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:41.549
&gt;&gt;Reto: That could well be, that could well
be.

00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:43.130
&gt;&gt;Adam: So we'd have to dig a little bit deeper
into that.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:47.059
&gt;&gt; Reto: And the very last thing I want to
say is that what's not clear to me as a music

00:45:47.059 --> 00:45:50.780
listener is where this music
is coming from and what the rights are for

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.780
them.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.330
So it seems like someone is blogging about
them, you know, I'm very

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:58.580
conscious of not wanting to pirate music when
there's plenty of sources that I can use to

00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.580
get it for free.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.490
I have
absolutely no idea what the scenario is here,

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.539
but that's kind of the point is it would be
nice to have some better

00:46:05.539 --> 00:46:09.290
idea exactly how this music is coming to be
on my phone.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.359
&gt;&gt;Adam: Or how it's going to be available
to me if I get on an airplane?

00:46:13.359 --> 00:46:14.359
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:46:14.359 --> 00:46:19.890
All right, so lightening round, we've got
Poweramp and PlayerPro, which both have very

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.690
similar icon stylings and as
it turns out fairly similar functionality.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.299
So let's start with Poweramp real quick.

00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:29.510
&gt;&gt;Adam: So Poweramp's been a longtime favorite
of a lot of others around the office here.

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:30.510
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.990
&gt;&gt;Adam: And once you start getting into it,
it becomes really easy to see why.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.480
So they seem to stick with a lot of
Android conventions just keep you familiar

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.470
with basic functionality.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:45.099
You've got not quite in action bar but very
similar here.

00:46:45.099 --> 00:46:48.740
Metrics are a little bit off-- It looks like
it may actually be in action bar [thumping

00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:53.120
and pouring
sounds] with some other modifications to it--we'd

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.599
have to look a little bit closer to be certain.

00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:55.599
&gt;&gt;Reto: Hmm.

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:56.790
&gt;&gt;Adam: But the convention is there.

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:57.790
See you know where to look for the sort of
thing.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.790
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:02.300
And as soon as you start pressing on the screen
it shows that these are bars and things that

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.050
you
can press and you get the little help texts

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.050
and things as well.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.050
&gt;&gt;Adam: Absolutely.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:07.050
&gt;&gt;Reto: Which is really nice.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:11.559
&gt;&gt;Adam: So this is a great feature as well--is
this ability to just swipe between tracks

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:12.559
that you have available.

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:17.809
&gt;&gt;Reto: So this totally makes my 'in the car'
experience work in that if I want to skip

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:18.809
the track, is just a swipe.

00:47:18.809 --> 00:47:21.060
I don't need to look at it or find the fast
forward key.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:22.349
I just swipe in the middle of the screen.

00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:23.349
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right.

00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:27.859
&gt;&gt;Reto: If we hit play--I can't change the
volume which is nice--we actually find out

00:47:27.859 --> 00:47:32.710
here, we can see that it does
have controls in the notification.

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:35.109
Which is excellent.

00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:40.369
And I don't know if it has it in the lock
screen.

00:47:40.369 --> 00:47:41.819
Unfortunately it doesn't have it in the lock
screen.

00:47:41.819 --> 00:47:44.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: No, this is the one where we had slightly
different options.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.200
&gt;&gt;Reto: Oh, right.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:49.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: User Jimjam mentions that you actually
do need to enable the lock screen controls

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.300
in the settings.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.930
&gt;&gt;Reto: We did in fact discover that, or at
least Adam did.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.339
&gt;&gt;Adam: Right, this is the sort of thing it
would be really great if the app would detect

00:47:56.339 --> 00:47:59.180
which sort of platform it
was running on and just automatically enable

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.180
this on default.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.740
But the fact that it is there it still gets
points.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:05.910
&gt;&gt;Reto: Exactly so that's great but it doesn't
seem like there's a good reason not to have

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.609
that as a default action.

00:48:07.609 --> 00:48:11.930
I'd actually be quite curious to know from
the developers' perspective why that is.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:15.930
You know why not default it on
given that you can detect what version of

00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:16.930
Android you're running on.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:20.680
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, it seems to be that they had
some other functionality to enable controls

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:24.141
on the lock screen in previous
versions of the platform as well so it may

00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:27.660
have been a matter of trying to keep your
settings as migrated so as not

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.359
to lose users through in OS upgrade.

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:30.500
&gt;&gt;Reto: That makes sense.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.539
So maybe it's just a simple case of checking
to see whether it's an upgrade or not in

00:48:34.539 --> 00:48:36.630
default in your options that way.

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:37.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:40.220
&gt;&gt;Reto: We had some really nice options here,
we're not going to go in too much depth but

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.730
really pretty controls for
the equalizer.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.220
In fact, you know, base, treble, volume, the
whole the whole thing.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:51.700
In fact if you go back--oh it
doesn't--maybe it's just in landscape version--it

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.809
has this nice effect.

00:48:52.809 --> 00:48:57.069
At least I thought that it did of showing
the equalizer in the action bar.

00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:58.279
I can't get that to come up right now.

00:48:58.279 --> 00:48:59.779
&gt;&gt;Adam: Oh I think that was if you run it
on a tablet.

00:48:59.779 --> 00:49:00.789
&gt;&gt;Reto: Maybe that was [unintelligible].

00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:04.190
&gt;&gt;Adam: This is one of the apps that provides
some interesting functionality on a tablet

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.190
as well.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.190
&gt;&gt;Reto: Cool.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.180
So we are totally out of time so we're not
going to into any more detail here.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.579
But generally speaking
this is a really nice app.

00:49:10.579 --> 00:49:14.480
Great functionality, does pretty much everything
that we ask it to in terms of what a

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.930
music player should do.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.150
So yeah, nicely done.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:22.890
&gt;&gt;Adam: Most of all, I really want to pull
this out as well, PowerAmp, and TuneWiki on

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:28.280
its list of songs as well,
you can really tell that they spent time optimizing

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.869
and made sure that the entire experience was
very smooth.

00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:32.869
&gt;&gt;Reto: Absolutely.

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.930
They're really polished, really nicely done.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.520
Now I know that our engineer is going to--

00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520
&gt;&gt;Adam: Get nervous.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:40.521
&gt;&gt;Reto: He's going to get really nervous if
we don't wrap up soon 'cause we're not going

00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:43.920
to have any time for the
team at The Friday Game Review to get started

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.340
so we're going to put a hold on PlayerPro
and see if we can't get a

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.520
chance to look at that at another point.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.661
Absolutely so far, we're really happy with
most of the apps we looked at

00:49:53.661 --> 00:49:54.661
today.

00:49:54.661 --> 00:49:58.900
I think that there's some really polished
experiences and some interesting up and comers

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:02.260
so definitely some
interesting perspectives on the genre.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.640
&gt;&gt;Adam: And what was really great was all
these apps really took a different approach

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.720
to playing music, I mean, you
don't see a lot of clone functionality between

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.720
these apps.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.720
&gt;&gt;Reto: Very true.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.770
And we didn't even have to go and pick and
choose different things that was just by virtue

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.319
of what
was on front page at moderator.

00:50:17.319 --> 00:50:22.470
Speaking of which, next week we're going to
be looking at football apps in celebration

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:27.160
of the beginning of the NFL
season here in the U.S. so if you have a football

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:31.330
app of any kind, please do nominate it in
the moderator so the team

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.289
can check it out next week.

00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:39.000
We're also going to try and start integrating
interviews with some of the developers of

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.020
some of these apps probably a week afterwards,
so anyone who been reviewed on The Friday

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.609
App Clinic or The Friday
Review which came before hand, do drop us

00:50:47.609 --> 00:50:50.700
a line if you're interesting in talking through
some of your decisions or

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.450
in fact if you've made any changes that you'd
like to share with us all.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:58.849
