&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Welcome everyone to another
APAC Developer Office Hours.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.430
I am joined here today by Anirudh Dewani
he's from Hyderabad--

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.430
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Hey guys.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.570
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Tony Chan from Hong Kong

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.220
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Hi everyone.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.590
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: And I am Ankur Kotwal from
Sydney.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.610
So those of you who haven't joined us before,
Developer APAC

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.590
Office Hours is all about you asking us questions
live.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.870
And we try our best to give you responses
to them.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.440
So these
are developer questions focusing on developing

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.720
on android.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.860
So we have a Google moderator link and you
can post

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.380
questions on there and yeah, so you can feel
free to do so.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.410
It's on the Google event, and we'll put the
link again

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.060
just as a reminder on the thread for the Hangout
itself.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.119
So with that, let's go to the first question.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.619
Okay.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:22.310
"So thanks for the answers"--I guess this
person joined us last time--"Sorry I couldn't

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.329
join last time.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.900
My question
is related to Secure Element access and selection.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.130
In my case my phone has two Secure Elements
and both are having

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.539
the same Base ID's.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.630
Which one will be selected over NFC?"

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.729
So typically I haven't seen too many devices
with more than one NFC device so it's pretty

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.359
cool that you have a phone
with two.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:57.539
I should probably clear up one thing, the
Secure Element is something we haven't got

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.929
API's for yet.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.099
It's a
secure element because we want to make sure

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.399
it doesn't get abused and misused.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.451
So there aren't API's for the Secure
Element itself, but you're asking about how

00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:19.610
to access the NFC adapter, well, distinguishing
between those two NFC

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.990
adapters Again, there's actually not a good
API for that now.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.660
If you look at the NFC adapter class or the
NFC

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.540
manager class, you can say "give me the default
device," but you can't actually say "give

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.730
me a specific device."

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.100
So right now it's going to give you whichever
one it considers to be the default.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.340
It also depends on what you are
doing with NFC because if you're integrating

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.870
with the sort of android beam technology you
can do that, I meant

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.460
that's abstracted for you, so just override
the right methods there and implement beam

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.460
support that way.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.930
If you have
a really low level NFC, then it's going to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.660
be different.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.140
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: I have just a quick note, I think
we are jumping between your screen and the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.340
moderator's screen,
constantly,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.680
so maybe we need to fix that because--for
the recording.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.570
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Sure.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.150
Thanks Tony.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.280
Okay, next question.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.140
" Low level media.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.530
Will future versions support decoding/demuxing
to byte arrays and encoding/muxing from byte

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.500
arrays
or bitmaps or sound samples, as opposed to

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.990
the microphone and speaker?"

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.410
Anirudh, do you want to take this one?

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.930
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Yep, so the one thing we
would like to say is we don't really have

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.510
media experts with us today.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.160
We
are in no way in a session from North America,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.250
about low level media APIs but we'll try our
best to answer these but just

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.690
in case we cannot, we'll forward it to our
team at North America.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:13.150
so, “will future version support decoding/demuxing"--so
right now we have the new low level media

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.010
API's , we have a way
of providing a byte buffer to a decoder or

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.269
an encoder and then cue the buffer using the
byte buffer which you can

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.860
create, so that is one way of doing it.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.389
The future, I don't really know and I guess
we can't really tell you right

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.389
now.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.389
[pinging noise]

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.729
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Thank you Anirudh.

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.530
So again, another low level media question.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:51.509
"Can LibStagefright classes be used in JNI
code somehow?" --it says--"JNI versus Android

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:56.210
source tree
Incompatibilities and stable native interfaces?"

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.340
I'm actually not an expert in the low level
media side of things and I actually didn't

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.199
understand what you mean by
the second part of the question.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:13.270
In terms of LibStagefright, I'm not sure,
what we'll do is again--today basically

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.699
just so you know, we have a lot of low level
media questions from Marcus in Europe and

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.080
unfortunately we don't have
any low level media experts on the Hangout

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.080
today.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.719
So what we'll do is we'll forward it to the
engineering team,

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.669
and ask the relevant developers and we'll
try to get responses to you in a future hangout.

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.720
So I don't know the answer to this particular
question, how 'bout you guys?

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.240
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Uh, no.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.600
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Not for this one.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:49.160
Also just a quick note for people who want
to look at the list of questions, they can

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:57.870
actually pin the screen for the moderator,
so if you want to, under the people tab, you

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.270
can actually just pin down
the moderator screen if you want to look at

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.330
the questions.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.770
Just a small tip.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:15.900
I will take the next question so the next
question is from Bala in Thanjavure:

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.039
"Android is now reached all the people who
use mobile phones.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.550
My question is if it goes to an Educational
Purpose

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.550
Tablet.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.059
How can we protect them from High maturity
content.

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:33.909
How to block the porn sites and Apps by default
on OS?"

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:42.289
So, first of all, I think this one is not
really a developer question but we're going

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.249
to answer this anyway.

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:54.139
So, one thing about maturity content, in Google
Play there is a content filter parents can

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.999
enable, so you can
set the setting to high maturity and then

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:07.229
give it a pin, so for children--this way we
can filter out all the maturity

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:10.150
contents from Google Play store.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:19.009
Another thing I want to point out is this
is not really a specific problem on mobile,

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.189
it is just a general problem on
even desktop environment.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:35.050
I guess also we need to be relying on parents
and also on teachers to help to fight this

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.050
issue.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.900
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: I'd like to add something
to that.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.440
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Mm Hm.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.039
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: I know some educational
institutions that are using Google Apps accounts

00:07:46.039 --> 00:07:47.879
as their university
accounts or

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:51.809
domain accounts to deploy these devices, a
provision with those accounts.

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:58.240
So with Google Apps you certainly have
some filters relating to mature content and

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.469
so if you are provisioning the accounts for
your students using Google

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:06.460
Apps, you have an actual way of filtering
that at the domain level or at the account

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.750
level before android so you can
define some policies there.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.060
The other one is as Google Device administrator
you also have some control over some

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:20.009
policies over the device if the device--if
the account is attached to a domain.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:25.629
For example you can say cameras not
allowed or stuff like that, but , yeah, those

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:27.610
are some of the other options you can think
up.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.610
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Yeah.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.590
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Yeah, I'll just bring this
back to developers and just say this is why

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:33.830
it is really important when
you

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:39.110
publish an app on Google play that you rate
it accordingly.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.070
It's--one, it's the right thing to do but
two, it's

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:50.770
actually against our policy to rate something
as being universally available when it should

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.020
be targeted at a mature
age group.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.870
So just keep that in mind developers.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:05.460
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: And one last thing I want to
add is in Google Play we do have policy to

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:11.520
for nudity containing content is
not allowed at all.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.640
If anyone, user or see this content, please
report those to us, and we will take the action

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.260
to
take those apps down.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.090
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: All right, thanks everyone.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.910
So, next question.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:32.840
"I have several apps on Google Play, but when
I search for my apps through Google search

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.570
I realized that other
websites are also selling my apps on their

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.950
sites, is there a way to protect my apps from
being sold on unauthorized

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.950
sites?"

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.410
And the answer is yes.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.500
What you should be using is what we have --something
that we have called License Verification

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.500
Library.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.320
I've brought up the page here, which is the
relevant section.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.800
But basically what you are doing is, your
app

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:05.160
is making a call to Google Play to confirm
whether the app has been purchased by that

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.140
user or not.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.450
And it's
particularly important that--I mean here we're

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.130
talking about the issue where, you know, it’s
been uploaded to other

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:20.650
sites but in general to combat piracy the
LVL is certainly one way to do it.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:27.810
So I suggest you go through this
Application Licensing section on the developer.android.com

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.640
site.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.650
The other thing is--I mean there's a couple
of

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:39.770
things to keep in mind here-- One is that
you want to use LVL to detect whether the

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.990
app has been pirated or being
badly sold, but it's important that you don't

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.510
just totally destroy the user's experience
of your app because if

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:54.000
they've installed your app and they're actually
using it, then you can see this as an opportunity

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.030
to try and convince
them to purchase it at the right place so

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.440
link it to the Play store.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.870
You may argue that it may or may not --you
might

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.750
not get too many people that will do this,
that convert from being a pirate to being

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:13.530
a legitimate paid user,
but in a way, the way you should look at it

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.990
is, even if you only convert a small percentage
of them, those are a

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.890
small percentage that you wouldn't have otherwise
been paid for--paid by.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:28.110
So it's really important that you look at
this but make sure that you don't implement

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.600
it in a way that degrades the experience for
the people who've already

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.750
purchased it.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.800
So make sure that you think about the offline
scenario when somebody hops onto a plane and

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.760
they're
using your app, if the LVL check is not able

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.880
to succeed at that point because the device
is offline, don't block the

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.050
user from using your app.

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.800
So there is a fine balance but the service
helps you.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.841
The last thing that I really should
argue that --

00:11:54.841 --> 00:12:02.180
[techno music sounds loudly]
--sorry I'm just going to mute on the Hangout,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.820
Yep.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.090
Sorry Andrew.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.810
But LVL basically we provide it as an open
source

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:15.100
implementation so it's a library; you can
grab it; you can incorporate it into your

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:21.130
app; you need to make sure that
you modify that source code.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.550
Don't just implement it the way it is because
there are people that are writing

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.090
automated tools to try and crack software
so if you implement that source code the same

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:34.180
way that it is now-- that
license checking--people are going to defeat

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.180
it.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.090
You need to come up with a unique implementation
and that's why it

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.310
is open source.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.020
We've tried to be as transparent as possible
there.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.630
Do you guys want to add anything?

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.630
Anirudh or
Tony?

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.910
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: I think it's--I think it's good.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.980
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Think it's good.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.400
&gt;&gt;Andrew Kelly: Just one thing on that one,
does that mean that you have to include extra

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.220
permissions for using the
Internet,so if you've got an app that would

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.690
have maybe one or two permissions then you
have to add extra permissions

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.380
just to use the Licensing Verification?

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.400
&gt;&gt; Ankur Kotwal: I think that is true.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.590
So yes, you'd probably need Internet permission
for that.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.430
Network permission,
yeah.

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.180
&gt;&gt;Andrew Kelly: Okay.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.940
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Okay.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.410
We have another low level media question from
Marcus.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:27.850
"Is there or will there be any supported way
to stream live video and audio?"

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:28.850
Anirudh?

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:35.190
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: I'm not sure if there are
any high level application API's, but certainly

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.190
possible.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.400
I mean many
apps do it.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.720
Many video conferencing apps have streaming
videos and audio.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.320
So I don't know of anybody with a high
level API, that you can just say start streaming

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.420
and stuff like that but it's definitely possible.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.380
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Yeah.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.790
Okay, next one.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:06.010
"Will the camera service auto-unlock in future
versions, so a crashed app doesn't block the

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.470
camera for every other app
until the phone is rebooted?"

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:14.390
I think Marcus is actually reporting an issue
where if an app that's grabbed the camera

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:20.290
service crashes
that it's locking the other apps from using

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:21.290
the camera.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:27.110
I haven't heard of this particular issue
and so if it exists, we should certainly--we

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.950
will certainly funnel it through to the engineering
team.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.700
And it is
something we should include in our compatibility

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:40.310
testing suite too to make sure that it's generally
reliable

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.430
everywhere.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.410
So thanks for that Marcus.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:52.880
From Andrew: "By default the Droid Sans font
is used on earlier versions of Android.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.311
With the new Roboto font, is
that only used on 4.x devices, or do you also

00:14:58.311 --> 00:15:00.670
need to use the Holo theme?

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.810
If Roboto is automatically used, is there
a

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.800
way to force Droid Sans?"

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.920
That's a very good question.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.350
Certainly when you use the Holo theme, it
will use the Roboto font.

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:17.860
I believe the Droid
Sans font is still there to insure backward

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.020
compatibility.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.020
Anything else?

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.740
Anirudh or Tony want to add to that?

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:36.570
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: So I guess like if you want to
use the Droid Sans font this is something

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:42.020
you need to override the
theme--the Holo theme right?

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.070
View on top of it?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.671
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Yeah, I'm not using the Holo theme.

00:15:45.671 --> 00:15:49.540
I was just wanting to make sure when my app
runs on all the different

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.270
devices it's going to use the same font across
all of them.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.940
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Oh.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:01.440
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: It's my understanding that
we still kept the Droid Sans font, and I think

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.410
it might even have to do
with which SDK version you're targeting--

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.570
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Okay.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.640
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: --as to whether it picks it
up or not.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.500
Certainly switching to the Holo theme will
enable it.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.070
&gt;&gt;Andrew: Okay, cool.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:18.590
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Okay, low level media again.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:26.260
"Is there a way to record multiple video streams
seamlessly (without gap between the end of

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.450
one and the start of the
next recording)?"

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.560
Not to my knowledge.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560
Anirudh?

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.340
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: No, I don't know the answer
to this one.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:39.529
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Sorry, we've obviously been
bombarded with low level media questions this

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:48.630
week and we are not experts
at that low level basically.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:56.010
This seems to be commentary: "The media APIs
seem to be developed for the sole use case

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:01.730
of recording single, short
files to disk and playing it back.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.980
Were other use cases like live video conferencing
on a camera smartphone or simple

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.150
video editing even considered?"

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:17.790
So I don't have any insight into what's happened
with the design side of things, but we've

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.500
got a video editor on--
that ships with the recent devices and I've

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.620
certainly seen video editing software on Play.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:29.710
So there are people that
are doing this with the high level API's that

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.370
we already provide.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.559
So, yeah, I'm sure there's a way to do it.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:37.250
&gt;&gt;Anirudh: Yeah.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:43.860
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: "How do you detect if an audio
codec is not supported?"

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:50.760
Well, for starters, we, on the android developers
website, actually have a list of supported

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.790
media formats.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.880
And these ones are the ones that will be guaranteed
to be supported across devices because it's

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.870
part of the
certification process for the platform itself.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:08.830
Now obviously with different versions of Android,
the support has grown

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:17.040
and grown so what I suggest you do is look
through these--this particular document and

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:22.930
then you can see which formats
are officially supported versus ones you might--you

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.700
know-- are definitely maybe's, as I like to
call them.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.570
Because
they could be value adds by the OEM's.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:38.010
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: I guess Marcus' question could
be also--the other part of the question could

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.130
be like, is there a way
to detect the list of supported codecs dynamically

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.960
based on the phone?

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:52.380
In Jellybean, we have a new class introduced
called Media Codec List.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:59.670
So they are causing that class--you can query
the cellphone by what type of media codec

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.630
is currently supported on that device.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:07.300
So--unfortunately it is only
available in API level 16.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:13.100
But hopefully in the future--hopefully that
will be useful for future phones.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.220
&gt;&gt;Ankur Dewani: Yeah.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:20.380
All right, thanks Tony.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.059
So I didn't see any more questions on the
thread.

00:19:24.059 --> 00:19:29.530
Andrew, did you have
any more that you hadn't put up on moderator

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:30.530
yet?

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:31.730
&gt;&gt;Andrew Kelly: No, uh, I only have one question.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.430
How do I get hold of an Android t-shirt with
Jellybean on the

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:35.430
front?

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.430
[laughter]

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.490
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: Uh, not sure yet.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:45.890
In the past we've --you know we have the Google
store--and we've had them--we've

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.290
sold these t-shirts there in the past.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:55.780
These are kind of hot off the press so we
thought we'd get them out today, so,

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.780
uh--

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.130
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: We've also given some of
those through communities, through the GDG's

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:06.660
and G-dots so, yeah, so just
get Ankur on your side and he might just send

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.200
you a box of each --

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.809
&gt;&gt;Andrew Kelly: I'll catch him at the next
GFG then--GDT?

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:12.809
[laughter]

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:14.330
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Okay.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.850
&gt;&gt;Ankur Kotwal: All right.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:23.330
Well that concludes the Q and A part of the
show for this week, but we wanted to just

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:28.390
cover a few announcements that we've had.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:33.300
So the first one I'd like to talk about is
actually about this show itself.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:38.230
There are some changes afoot,
and we're going to be changing the way we

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.330
do this show next week onwards, so I don't
want to go into the details

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.050
but stay tuned.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.630
We're hoping these will be--that these changes
are an improvement.

00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.440
We've been listening to all the
feedback that we've been getting and we've

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.430
been trying to implement as much of it as
possible.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:06.510
All right, the other things that I wanted
to mention are relating to some news that

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.650
we've had through the week.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.630
Firstly, we've had an update to the Android
SDK tools.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:17.850
This is mainly just a minor bug fix.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.679
But on top of that, we're
also updated the Android Support Library.

00:21:21.679 --> 00:21:28.531
So we have a new notification builder API
to try and sort of add some

00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:34.420
backward compatibility for some of the cool
new notifications that we introduced in Jellybean.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.190
So worth your while to
go and update your--through the SDK manager--just

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:46.300
keep in mind that there was a bug that was
there in the SDK manager

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:52.400
where the update may not show up so as the
Post says, just you might need to go into

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:59.090
packages and then hit the reload
option to refresh the SDK manager cache so

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.700
that the update shows up.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:08.240
Next thing--one of my favorite websites is
the Android Design website.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.670
So that's a developer.android.com/design.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:14.000
It
will add the index.html for you so you don't

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.860
need to put that in yourself.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:23.240
But this has been a great website that we
introduced around December or January.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.630
December 2011, January of this year.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:32.260
And basically it covers all of the great design
guidelines that we follow when developing

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.730
our own Android apps.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:40.230
So we've had some new updates to this site
that we put live this week, so it's certainly

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.200
worth your while to going
and checking those out.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:51.320
So, things like how to confirm and acknowledge
input from the user, and it goes through all

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:57.320
of this in some great detail, and it will
help you add that level of polish, you know.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:02.940
When are you asking too many
questions, when are you asking the right questions--as

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.880
you all will know you don't want to approach
mobile

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.250
development with a very desktop centric mindset.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:15.850
This particular section is really great for
just explaining how it should

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:16.850
work.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:23.000
So the same thing when it comes to selection--the
selection site is actually just talking about

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.470
how we transitioned to using the
contextual action bar instead of having a

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.890
popup for menus.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:38.840
There is now a new section on widgets, and
including the

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.750
updated widgets that we have like for the
gallery for example.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.890
And you know, the re-sizing and so on and
so forth.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.559
So it's really really interesting.

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:55.809
As you all will know, widgets just add a great
user experience.

00:23:55.809 --> 00:24:01.470
It's a way to--I
mean--if you think about it from a developer's

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:06.450
standpoint, if a user is putting your widget
on their home screen

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.410
you have an opportunity to draw users into
your content.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.410
This is dynamic content that you are updating
and it is so

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:17.110
much more powerful than just having your app
icon on their home screen.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:23.350
Because you can change the content, you can
alert users to changes that will again, I

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.929
mean you're given the opportunity to invite
them in.

00:24:26.929 --> 00:24:31.240
So widgets are really
important and in the future, you know, we'd

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.410
love to talk to you about how to make it well
known to your users that

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.600
you have a widget.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.231
How do you help them discover that?

00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:42.820
That's certainly a topic we'd like to discuss
in the future.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.860
So that's widgets, uh, notifications.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.929
Obviously there was tons of information on
notifications before but in Jellybean we added

00:24:50.929 --> 00:24:53.020
rich notifications.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.660
So with
these rich notifications you can expand them

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:01.360
and have all sorts of beautiful images and
so again the design site is

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.160
going through and describing what that experience
should be like.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:11.620
The design site is more --is literally for
designers so it's not showing you code but

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:17.210
all you have to do is flip from the design
section to the develop section

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.170
to jump to the relevant code pieces.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:24.070
And, finally, settings, uh, this is actually
a section we introduced a little while ago

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:29.620
but it's still fairly new
and it just talks about how--what things should

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.220
be settings, you know, when is it right to
offer a setting for a

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:35.690
particular option?

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.030
And finally I'm going to close off with a
section that we introduced called Videos.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:45.220
So Google IO this year there was
a whole range of videos on the design process,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.450
when it comes to designing an Android app
so we've basically collated

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.670
and grouped these Android design videos on
one convenient page so you can watch them

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.700
all in one go.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.960
So for budding
designers or Android designers these videos

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.460
are really really really useful.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.750
Some great tips there.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:14.120
So that's pretty much it for What's New with
Android this week, uh so what about Tony and

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.970
Anirudh, anything else?

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.570
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: Nothing much.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.720
So--

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:31.740
&gt;&gt;Ankur Dewani: All right if that's it then
thank you for tuning in this week and we'll

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.770
catch you next week with some
big changes.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:35.790
All right, thank you.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:37.059
&gt;&gt;Andrew Kelly: Cool, cheers guys.

00:26:37.059 --> 00:26:38.070
&gt;&gt;Tony Chan: [unintelligible] thanks.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.600
&gt;&gt;Anirudh Dewani: Have a nice one.
