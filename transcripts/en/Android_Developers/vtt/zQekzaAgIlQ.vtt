IAN LAKE: Welcome to Android
Development Patterns, where

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.460
we help you build better apps.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.570
I'm Ian Lake.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.510
Let's get to work.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.930
Let's think about how you
navigate through an app.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.440
You navigate to a detailed
view from the parent view,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.470
or you can navigate
between sibling views.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.570
That's where tabs and
ViewPagers come in.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900
So what is a ViewPager?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.210
That's what controls the actual
swiping between different pages

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.270
of content.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.416
ViewPager gets its content
from a PagerAdapter.

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:36.630
This could be a
generic view-- one

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.880
for each page-- or
whole fragments,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.970
if you use a
FragmentPagerAdapter

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.178
or FragmentStatePagerAdapter.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.920
FragmentPagerAdapter
keeps each fragment

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.130
it creates in memory, making
it lightning fast to switch

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.480
between already loaded tabs.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.186
However, this can get
expensive, memory-wise,

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:59.330
if you have a large
number of fragments.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.760
Something
FragmentStatePagerAdapter

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.910
solves by destroying and
recreating fragments as needed,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.230
only saving the state.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.060
There isn't a lot
to a PagerAdapter.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750
You'll need to override
getCount to return

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.630
the number of pages you have.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.730
Then, in the case of a
FragmentPagerAdapter,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.830
you'll need to
implement getItem,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.350
which returns the fragment
associated with each position.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.680
Here, we'll just do a
simple switch statement,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.810
selecting the right
fragment for each position.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.252
But you have the flexibility
to use any approach you want.

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.960
The other thing we
might want to override

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.830
is getPageTitle, returning a
string describing each page.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.970
Why would you want a page title?

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.810
Well, those page titles
will be really helpful

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.620
if you want to have some tabs
associated with your ViewPager.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.840
Tabs give users a
great way to see

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.810
exactly what those pages
contain without having

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.230
to scroll through each one.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.650
They also allow users
to jump between pages

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.216
by tapping on a tab.

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:07.250
The TabLayout class, part of the
Android Design Support Library,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.538
makes it easy to implement tabs,
with all the material design

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:11.520
styling.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.740
And it's backward
compatible to Android 2.1.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.660
Let's hook everything together.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.230
First, we need to
hook our ViewPager up

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.890
to a PagerAdapter
using setAdapter.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.820
Then, hooking up a TabLayout
is just a single method

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.860
setupWithViewPager.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.920
With just that, you get tabs
from the PagerAdapter's titles.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.390
And swiping through pages
will change the tabs,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.480
and tapping on tabs will change
the pages-- as you'd expect.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.130
Get started with the
TabLayout and ViewPagers

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.980
by adding the Design Library.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.000
Be sure to check out
the design guidelines

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.340
and the detailed training docs.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.800
Thanks for joining me here on
Android Development Patterns.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.000
Use tabs and ViewPagers
to build better apps.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.950
