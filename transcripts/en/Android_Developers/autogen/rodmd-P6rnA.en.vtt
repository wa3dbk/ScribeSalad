00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.869
 the staff is also starting here 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.390
 an edition of May 29 for Brazil 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 I am bruno oliveira nelson born 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.400
 marim and we are presenting here 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.540
 directly from the google reptiles in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.250
 mountain view california 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.050
 I know our our android studio 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.960
 then we have a series of 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.789
 a collection on big dolls android 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.809
 a lot of other things like that arose 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.180
 cool 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.530
 so in today's issue we're going 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 do the following takes place I think 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.370
 Let's talk a little while, I think. 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.130
 there is a novelty that is also 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 interesting that it is only recently 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.000
 interesting who does not take a look 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 still take a look because it is that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 recently released a new version of the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.220
 developer user interface 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 So comfort when you go there 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.120
 console that allows you to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 publishing android applications has a 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.000
 interface new deli we're done 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.489
 to launch 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 so just enter the procon novel 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.770
 You'll see an orange link up there. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.600
 trend destroys preview 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.460
 de nico predicted it will change our 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 for new interface in international 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.900
 much improved potato and makes it very 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 make it easier for you to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.549
 You keep track of what's happening. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.110
 with your application because what I want 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.490
 always say that you publish a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 application is easy, right? 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.900
 The same hard is you do over active 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 having success once published is very 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 important that you publish the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.130
 application and then keep an eye on 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.260
 see what's happening with him right? 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.939
 It is not just put there and I hope it gives 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.799
 sure one of the things that is very 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.659
 It is important that you always keep track of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.610
 which are the statistics of use of the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.110
 application or whatever device 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.850
 that is being used to access the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.990
 application which is the type of user with 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.210
 the user profile 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 finally a successful developer always 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.619
 knows very well who your users are 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.659
 so if I ever ask the provider 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.430
 so it gives me a characteristic one 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.229
 characterization of how you are and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.729
 if I want to talk I do not know 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.909
 this guy is probably not doing 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.970
 An application is then always ideal. 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.970
 you have this answer is to cut or 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.530
 No matter how you use it, you do not have 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.530
 that having this always moves 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.330
 interesting news and I felt that the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.980
 people who would be good even if they have good 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.870
 and it's is I think this is one of the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.489
 main criticisms recently 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.550
 Let's move on to the questions of the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.440
 reader tamer is there are those of you 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.540
 questions you have asked through the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.400
 elector mode on another time a right or 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.510
 directly through our page on the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.940
 google developer day live 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 so let's start to do is respond 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 to questions in order of popularity 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.310
 the first question he got here 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.660
 it's dodo rafael had abstain from spring 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.239
 following we use a record level 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.620
 to record videos and we're not 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.170
 satisfied with the audio quality 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 specially generated video recorded in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.530
 concerts where there is a lot of noise 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.959
 tips to get the best out of your 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.370
 audio the android is then the question is the 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.069
 I have an application that 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.510
 it records audio in then it's audio from 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.310
 android records obviously it is 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 limited by the radio's characteristic 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.080
 device did not explode I have one 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.299
 positive number is it has a microphone 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.950
 embedded here is then clearly a 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.109
 built-in microphone 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.850
 I mean, it's made for some 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.829
 uses such as make you do 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.660
 legal says is to make connections this kind of 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.760
 thing but there are some environments in which 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.590
 it does not perform as well as 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.079
 for example in an auditorium room 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.690
 health and victory has a problem with it 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.980
 has the echo of feedback right when 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.079
 example you are receiving the sound of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.480
 various sources at the same time 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.519
 Just happens to arrive here at one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.500
 certain time and then there is another sound that is 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.910
 a sound copy that arrived at no 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.430
 slightly longer interval 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.920
 this does that reverb effect 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.139
 which decreases the audio quality is 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.489
 first place this is not a norm 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.840
 thing you're doing wrong or 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.040
 be it is not a thing that you do not 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.380
 goal is doing wrong obviously 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.700
 is not only capturing the audio and 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.920
 so it comes because the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.780
 hardware feature now exists 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.970
 software techniques that allow you to 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.709
 get this signal that is recorded and you 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.450
 treat this signal for you to try 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.220
 eliminate this poor quality a bit 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.650
 one of the things you can do yourself 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.570
 pick up this raw nacinal sign and you 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.570
 do a post-processing for example the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.539
 on android has one has a casino package 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.330
 android on the question, I guess I think 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:29.330
 android 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.170
 inside this package you will see that 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.480
 there are a number of classes your 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.580
 Letters to you make media effect 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.020
 android one of the parts that I remember 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 There you have it. 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.650
 that it has several effects that you 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.150
 can create there using android audio né 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.640
 one of the effects they have there if I do not 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.740
 deception calls ecom cancellation is a 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.420
 thing, and it serves precisely to 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.210
 when you want to treat an audio that it 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.340
 was recorded or captured in some 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.530
 environment in which you have very much 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.270
 you need to cancel the redundant echo in which 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.140
 would be for example the case of a 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.250
 concert 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.320
 Can you do the opposite? 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.940
 also wants to get the pure audio and do 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.830
 sound like it's a concert hall 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.780
 It's you who has to get a 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.510
 audio that is heavily polluted is with 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.390
 echoes and redundancy you want to remove 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.280
 effects and become purer in the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.920
 so I'd recommend you take a look 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.930
 in this set of classes in which 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.700
 android if that's our mistake 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.890
 point dot android 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.910
 the media effects wait for something 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.380
 so it is otherwise the exercise did not solve 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.930
 problem for you would recommend trying 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.060
 use some external library to see 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.730
 if you can process signal I extracted 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.890
 the original audio of it you treat the 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.800
 audio in general so the experience that 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.540
 it means that I had that of others 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.820
 developers that audio accent 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.700
 of the android she gives gives you a power of 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.320
 processing is very reasonable 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.210
 most apps think it will 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.760
 being will be enough to do this 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.440
 note that not all versions are ap 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.790
 It's available and I forgot that it was 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.950
 it just started 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.080
 I know it certainly does not match roney 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:07.690
 how do you do that i do not know if it says brad 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.729
 Jackson does not remember but if you want to 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.530
 can not hear this does not mean that you 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.330
 can not use this does not mean that 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.850
 you have to detect if the user is 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.150
 using the minimum or higher version you 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.919
 this feature this user is not 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.260
 using a version enough for this 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.270
 You do not use the child or you do or beck. 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.010
 for an alternate version that you can 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.360
 implement using an external note 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.610
 something like this in proposal one 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.440
 last warning with a year nothing what had 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.830
 to lose a little quality a thing 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.419
 like this 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.040
 is exactly the user's communication is 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.750
 very important in this case he understood 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.740
 starting a new application that is 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.960
 doing post processing 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.509
 Well, you know perfectly well that 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.400
 exactly is it good for the next question 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:48.199
 We are monitoring the post here. 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.410
 if anyone has a question to ask 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:53.990
 live just enough you catch and say 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:58.160
 just take the android post 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:07:00.289
 developers and post it from new profiles in the 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.410
 bruno's number but the original 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:05.000
 aa gym and now it would be interesting 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.080
 get this post on the screen in the 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.240
 comments 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.590
 but until it resolves is the second 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.050
 question receipt 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.729
 bruno since google asks that the 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.710
 developers do not web to 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.729
 specific versions of android provides 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.380
 meters for this 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.630
 good reminder area we have several 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.940
 for this as explaining that the 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.880
 chrome and calendar fact does not work 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:30.349
 in versions prior to the ics world was 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.360
 of lucas xavier aracaju bomba happens 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:34.190
 so summarizing the question if we are 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.690
 telling you to do here to 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.159
 all android versions because we 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.690
 does the opposite of what you are talking about and 

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.069
 makes the chrome available only this way 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.979
 being says up, right? 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:44.780
 the answer is we, our county in 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:47.630
 general is not easy is for all 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.789
 android versions is independent of the 

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.740
 ether make apps that works with my 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.659
 version of android you need right? 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.699
 Certainly you will not fail to launch. 

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:57.320
 an ep because it does not work in the car 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:59.599
 hot then there are certain applications 

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.539
 which rely on resources that only 

00:07:59.599 --> 00:08:04.130
 advanced versions android has to 

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.840
 chrome is the browser is the 

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.280
 extremely complex browser it has 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.800
 a complexity that is extremely 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.330
 big and he really needs 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.380
 some movies that are available there 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:17.780
 nuno only in Haiti on the scene then 

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.030
 depending on the case, what we do is 

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.370
 of course any player can do this 

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.690
 is you unfairly restrict the version 

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.550
 android when that is 

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.349
 absolutely necessary does not always have 

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:29.180
 that balance that has to be has to 

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:30.289
 being hit between you has a 

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.079
 application that works for everyone 

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:34.789
 users and you suddenly spend a lot 

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:38.419
 time with old versions that are not 

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:40.430
 your target audience is as far as the 

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.719
 possible we advice is always easy is 

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.740
 an application that works for all 

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:45.680
 android versions 

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.310
 from time to time it will or will not be 

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:51.030
 possible to follow if this gasoline 

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.500
 that including ourselves 

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.420
 we do not know if he in the case of 

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.820
 chrome at the time of the collective is what 

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.110
 will also dedicate you personal and that is the 

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.810
 next you will develop some 

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.550
 anything ideal starts with the version 

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.840
 more sporty without you 

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.240
 chatted as old as possible only 

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.310
 put with the pillar for your project 

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.560
 if during the project as a fischer 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.120
 Let's give a very basic example if you want 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.960
 make animation do the animation 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.760
 view 

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.320
 remembering that version 1.6 had no 

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.300
 jury even though it's okay that you connect 

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.250
 nobody uses the version with three but let's 

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.090
 an example was only to understand how the 

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:22.920
 business 

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.540
 obviously make an animation the 

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.500
 view is not something that prevents the dream 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.080
 that I had to leave 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.390
 so you can do maybe you can not 

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.220
 fit or use a feature for the part is 

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.930
 available in two versions 

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.670
 now if it's a thing that can not be 

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.290
 done maybe you will have to limit 

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.840
 raise this barrier a little and 

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.210
 with the newest version and e there 

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:45.210
 unfortunately you can have some kind of 

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.710
 loss of people who will power 

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.830
 use but unfortunately this can 

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.240
 happen but it is by a limitation it is 

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.790
 specific applications have the minimum 

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:57.600
 It's best not to have no qualification 

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.170
 remembering this, we already talked about the dap 

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.980
 site 

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:04.890
 I wanted a chat this week I think 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.720
 that will not power is true the attack is 

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:10.050
 one will only get what this is a camera 

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.400
 seems in fact depending on the cause of 

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.600
 resolution to this may end up being a 

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.980
 green pixel ne 

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.160
 this here is actually a machine 

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:19.050
 android but I'm not kid our brand 

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.490
 android it does all the functions of being 

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.690
 an android doll or in all 

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.280
 the sites be a doll, right? 

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:26.250
 specifically it stays there being a 

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.230
 doll and it also works as 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.920
 one not from below for finding him line 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:34.050
 I have here to get your legs out 

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.450
 him and he turns a pen drive 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.400
 so he not only stays there being 

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.930
 android as it also serves to 

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.280
 store thing inside bag 

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.930
 impress all the staff of the 

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.000
 office with the pen drive is a robot with 

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.560
 also some with exactly that 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.420
 Incredible and revolutionary pendrive 

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.730
 android then we would like to 

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.570
 software and today only the problem is that 

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.400
 we have to we are in 

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.070
 mountain view and 

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.170
 To send Brazil, I did not remember. 

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:00.650
 one thing I have some 

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.340
 the table is ok then it will not be 

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.710
 today 

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.210
 We're going to draw today but he's only going to be. 

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.830
 sent from next week 

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.860
 when I return to Brazil 

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.480
 so we can send more 

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.710
 enjoying the week he had thought 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.930
 in raffle this robot super robot drive 

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.240
 we made the 1-0 that always makes a 

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.980
 some challenge is not the type of the last one 

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.990
 The defense wanted the numbers challenge 

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.310
 cousins ​​taking advantage of which was the 

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.720
 number with certain characteristics 

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.720
 the smallest prime number 

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:33.860
 Let's do something like this again. 

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.740
 he made that draw based on since 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.480
 Twitter posts is not that it was good is a 

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.920
 way you are sure that the 

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.150
 lottery is really the win 

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.660
 unless we are controlled 

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:46.280
 of the inter in the thing that does not happen 

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.690
 So what are we going to do next? 

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.730
 The winner of this signal pendrive is 

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.080
 of 1 exactly the same and if that is going to be 

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:56.060
 that this winter from Brazil does not 

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.970
 said specifically because this now 

00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:04.280
 mine is going to be the next one who first 

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.840
 post a comment in this passage from 

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.940
 regal time just looking at the passage of 

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.210
 real said no no in my dreams 

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.080
 comments on my profile neither 

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.490
 nuno gomes neto 

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.990
 We're just looking at the 

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.970
 comments from the original post that people 

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.910
 made for legal commission and is the 

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:23.300
 first you post a direct link 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:25.490
 we want a link to the assignment of the 

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.350
 android design guide are depositing 

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.760
 at this point 1 bar design right this is the 

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:31.130
 our android design 

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.620
 then the first to the first post 

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.690
 a link there to the session that talks about 

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.910
 Context sentences 

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.950
 then the rain will continue to capture action and 

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.840
 in a contextual bar than the one that 

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:44.060
 that it appears when you 

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.980
 select one or more items it appears is 

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.140
 call her change of face she turns max one 

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.300
 bar no more graduation she turned one more 

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.580
 bar that is contextual that it gives you actions 

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.140
 to perform on those items that 

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.330
 are deleting an email from gmail 

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:58.190
 also in things like that but it has to be 

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:00.080
 this part of the floor hit this key 

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.760
 hit the specific page does not work 

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.460
 bet on a link there then the great 

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.740
 combat point 

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.090
 zaine speak that is at stake is the letter is 

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.370
 not we do not go resources equally 

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.360
 no recursion book exactly from 

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.100
 depth 

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.530
 I can not even speak after legal people 

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:16.110
 go look and and communicate the winner 

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.330
 and then next week I'll let you know 

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.100
 I communicate with the winner in vila do 

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.120
 Brazil remembering that it is only valid for 

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.520
 Who is in the national territory? 

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.770
 that's what it's worth and for 

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.030
 locations that are served by the 

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.530
 sedex service 

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.870
 It's the only way we can 

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.250
 send is ours and lex ne 

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.660
 if you live in a region that is not 

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.890
 answered by sedex, we can not 

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.140
 go to you that we can not 

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.030
 take you to your house in memphis 

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.500
 but I will not be able to spend a day with 

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.000
 evolution of technology, we do not go out 

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.250
 can get something like that and put 

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.310
 in the cloud the embassy of the night thinking 

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.140
 How much surprise, send it to me. 

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.900
 send a file biological reason was 

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:55.020
 low and it looks cool on the return of 

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:56.700
 patent to a patent is why there is 

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.160
 the next question we have here 

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.710
 of the madureira is the following is the question 

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.650
 from marcelo h da guerra minas gerais 

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:07.380
 the new idea of ​​oracle and ef mobile in 

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.070
 the link of ideas cross will be the 

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.880
 best 

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:14.610
 good to one of the things I like best 

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.410
 android is what it does not have is a 

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.790
 open platform so you are not 

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.560
 thank you to use a specific idea 

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.490
 you are not required to use a 

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.410
 specific 

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.210
 so you have complete freedom to 

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.680
 You use cordel you want you have 

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.030
 Why tell you as a player? 

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.620
 you also have complete freedom to 

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.510
 develop your own leg 

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.600
 I find it difficult to answer objectively 

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.040
 what better idea because the idea is 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.870
 best idea is the one in which you 

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.220
 productive to this is a lot of taste 

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:40.200
 Guys I think I hear this one. 

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.000
 discussion since when I started to 

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.370
 to win with java ten years ago that had 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.660
 the staff used gel that used netbeans 

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.120
 eclipse 

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.830
 this is very particular you adapt 

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.020
 better with the shortcut key of a duo 

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.580
 with the shortcut key of another né 

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:56.130
 There are a lot of people still talking 

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.480
 so send send the best interface 

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.970
 of movement 

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.980
 another fan of max so that's a lot 

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.300
 It is difficult for us to reach a 

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.190
 I suddenly like what I prefer 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.180
 that Bruno prefers what you prefer 

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:10.710
 so there is not much is whoever wants to stay 

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:13.140
 the tip going from marcelo whoever you want 

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.340
 try for sure it was worth the hint but it's 

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.900
 a person known many options 

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:18.060
 people try and 

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.530
 but this day really better interface 

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:21.480
 we could spend hours here 

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.740
 arguing which is better but they do not 

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.390
 reached a consensus is that a 

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.580
 very personal and personal enjoyment 

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:29.790
 I personally like the eclipse, right? 

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.710
 because he's the team he does everything he 

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.870
 There are no comments 

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:36.480
 positive and negative on the team but 

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.160
 so in general it is a tool that 

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.850
 made me very productive in the sentence 

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.770
 judicial and appropriate to him 

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.200
 solves a lot and what is legal about 

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.760
 bt plugin that evolves very fast I 

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.650
 remember that today is already in the version 

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.720
 20 I do not know how much when I came in 

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.910
 in google it was here in version 8 

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.800
 he was rather rudimentary compared to him 

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:57.540
 today he means the 

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.950
 landfill was very very fast today in 

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.110
 for example when you create a 

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:01.800
 new a new android application on 

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.360
 eclipse 

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.580
 He already wanted you, for example, 

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.200
 tv that already has one more bar since it is 

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.760
 You on the TV that already has that master of 

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.800
 have focus then it does a lot 

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.390
 automatically to you and pulp you 

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.690
 can create a template including god 

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:18.510
 it is also very flexible, but also 

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:20.790
 staff you want to use fire three 

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:26.330
 I'm not going to give my 

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:32.880
 also the mayor is also the eclipse but 

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:37.650
 I had to years of arguing where is where 

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:44.550
 we make a cup of snow is 

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:46.470
 interesting this bag in brazil 

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.300
 next question that we have here 

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.360
 Madureira is the following is the question 

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.830
 about teams nelinha souza do brasil is 

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.270
 possible to get a team here from 

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.640
 own user to use the service 

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.100
 the goal my application makes use of places 

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.630
 and piaui is there is a way the user 

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.490
 do the quest avoiding the limit 

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.830
 recognizes that they use them 

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:08.160
 here is the short answer to this 

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:09.839
 is not everything is produced in every idea 

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.360
 behind you have a team here is 

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:13.709
 You just keep the load. 

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.050
 servers in a way that is 

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:18.750
 just for all the rodents, right? 

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.450
 without us having to make a do 

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.830
 a very aggressive charge on what 

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.470
 happens when you have a team here 

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:27.090
 it is he establishes for you a limit by 

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.620
 application regardless of how old 

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.480
 you have 

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.860
 it is also that limit that is free or 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.050
 you can use to explore the 

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.970
 kite to small applications and the week 

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.770
 of a certain limit of the 

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:39.020
 You start to have to pay a little to 

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.630
 you receive it then as far as I 

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:43.550
 I know there is no crisis by design, no 

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.960
 there is a way for every user to sau 

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.750
 It's different because you have 

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.460
 just the ipi that is for is to be 

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.500
 for everyone an application independent of 

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.850
 how many users does it have? 

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.890
 also uses only your own 

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:56.120
 application is to try the executive 

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.800
 that they are always transparent 

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.420
 user make usability 

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.520
 so if you ask to fall for a 

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.410
 page does recognize of a penalty that 

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.480
 this can only be born a user 

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.280
 technician may be accustomed to the 

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.890
 registration page of an app store 

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.210
 so it's really something that the 

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.950
 people recommended or skipped the 

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.140
 holland the technical usability side 

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.240
 oblige the technician to give you news 

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:19.250
 deliver everything goes to the usability of 

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.080
 your own application actually resembles 

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:23.150
 that so the user's eyes exist 

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:24.950
 application when when the 

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.840
 documentation has two pages imagine if 

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.820
 you if you ask the user to enter 

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.530
 on a site to generate a key such as 

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.809
 applications wheel switch means nodes 

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.580
 it's a practical thing just if you 

00:18:32.809 --> 00:18:36.320
 you may have passed this limit then 

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.540
 This is cool, and you and I are trying to see. 

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.130
 a way to monetize an application that 

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.429
 you are passing the limit of the limit to the 

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.080
 reasonable number of resources per day 

00:18:43.429 --> 00:18:46.370
 exceeding this limit is a sign that 

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.770
 this app is doing starting 

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:50.690
 a success the same people can you can 

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.450
 look for a way to monetize this 

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:55.580
 live time with subscription with com 

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.320
 premium version app sales 

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.750
 until then because if you are passing 

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.420
 Congratulations, the application is doing 

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.010
 a cool success so you have some 

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.290
 doubt search the world forums have 

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:09.050
 documents monetization year not developing 

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.460
 android dot com then so maybe it is 

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.920
 the moment to look also for you to see 

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.490
 that the title is well because the 

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.010
 limit 

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.110
 no one talks enough has in the head of 

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:21.020
 limit for 39 

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:22.730
 only maybe we speak in china is not 

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.650
 so low is born the application is 

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.210
 serene if it is limited because it certainly 

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.100
 is going well as the grandson said 'no 

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.540
 You can try to exploit this to 

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.130
 monetize the application in some way 

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.290
 to cover these costs 

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.380
 even so, but there she would have to talk more 

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.090
 the application is not there I do not want 

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.890
 same users also in this case asks 

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.050
 asks for donations in this case if you have a 

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.640
 application that has a whole impact and it 

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.840
 not an app that is not commercial 

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.970
 you do not want to put a 

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.590
 commercial component and no ads on it 

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.940
 it's certainly because he does a service 

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.430
 for the user it is very valuable that the 

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.870
 people like exactly for example 

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.640
 there are many sites and applications that 

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:57.910
 are fully moved or 

00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:00.880
 then the dwarf does not underestimate the 

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.050
 Donate power is sometimes much better. 

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.850
 you have an application that accepts 

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.100
 donations what puts advertisement depending on 

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.290
 application will be left over 

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.120
 then it means monetizing is not a 

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.920
 necessarily mercantilist thing 

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.600
 monetized capitalists and also 

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.550
 means you put a lapa button goes 

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.260
 get donations and keep your uncle 

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.600
 that working 

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.220
 Do you have any questions online we'll see 

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.810
 If you have any questions online 

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.610
 I can not access the post 

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.650
 here then do the following a question 

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:28.960
 I'll arrive directly at the rescue. 

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:33.090
 here is some legal participant who 

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.480
 want to come in and ask a question jack 

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:46.740
 jones 

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:46.740
 only in one year 

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.270
 only that someone talking about something can 

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.190
 talk there, just raise your hand and only 

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.440
 she's something to know that 

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.690
 Do you want to ask the water question? 

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.970
 that's a question he'll talk 

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:04.440
 Can you ask Gabriela a question, does not it hurt? 

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.440
 the lipstick we're talking about 

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:20.730
 the fall of the dollar here only increase so 

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:20.730
 that I am not alone I know the weight that demands 

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:32.380
 ipad just for him to stay a little this 

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:34.750
 service is that this google service is 

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.060
 the following it is a is a way of 

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:39.700
 you authenticate using the identity of the 

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:42.790
 google user play this through 

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.020
 of the goal and services then the suit is 

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.120
 a component of it calls google places 

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:49.510
 ice cream that applications can 

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.770
 access one of these children's 

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.330
 that he has just the authentication 

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.620
 per user in a way that you 

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.600
 can do in a consistent way 

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.040
 in several applications for example you 

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.020
 need the user only with the 

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.520
 google and linus account the app you 

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.080
 could make its own interface is 

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.460
 certain is no longer the user now 

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.100
 much more comfortable if you use a 

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.450
 interface you already saw had in the 

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.920
 device is not what it is for 

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:11.020
 this part authentication of google places 

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.940
 and after that you can for example 

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.710
 got a token gave to the end né 

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.170
 and mentioned who you can use for you 

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.000
 make calls given to some just the 

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.340
 google so that's what it's all about 

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.400
 this is not for the user to be able to 

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:26.470
 call country using a pic of your own 

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:29.560
 user will still be limited to 

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:32.170
 the use of the mode ae pierre kipré place zip 

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.840
 and other birds that are limited in the new 

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.490
 from an app application 

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.050
 exactly as it is a 

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.550
 way you can get a token by 

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.150
 for you to call service from the 

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.040
 Google 

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.560
 but this does not influence the counting of 

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.790
 already thinking of itself the identity of the 

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.400
 the user is making that call 

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.620
 for example if users make a 

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.840
 call to get for example things 

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.550
 he has on google docs drive 

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.260
 currently you will get it you need 

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.400
 authenticated knowing that I am for 

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:59.650
 friends info on google drive 

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.860
 flash that serves this touch but it does not 

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.940
 It's meant to make a metric of mine. 

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:06.250
 usage quota 

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.070
 You do not need some 

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.580
 ipi is here that is pure application now 

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.580
 cool 

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.640
 So let's move on to the next one. 

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.720
 ask here the next question valley 

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:20.710
 is 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.750
 the lucas xavier cashew 

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.850
 bruno besides developing for android 

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:27.159
 developed beach but also with this 

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.419
 ex gold storyboard tool exists 

00:23:27.159 --> 00:23:30.070
 the possibility of launching a tool 

00:23:28.419 --> 00:23:31.990
 similar for android 

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.909
 then to the one who does not know the 

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.500
 Storyboard tool of choice 

00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:37.809
 I do not have much experience with 

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.700
 apple but so I've seen people using 

00:23:37.809 --> 00:23:41.230
 the storyboard the themes - war is a 

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.380
 tool that allows you to make your own 

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:46.000
 data layout tell my phone and it shows 

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.710
 for example the hierarchical relationship between 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.929
 the screens with this land leads to this 

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.740
 That hurry back to this is 

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:55.260
 that excuse does not know 

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.220
 only this 

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.230
 Wow if we through our 

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.700
 specialty but giving a summary 

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.140
 so already risking talking 

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.789
 bullshit I think I'm just like 

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:09.100
 one thing that does it there is in our 

00:24:05.789 --> 00:24:10.330
 what does adp mean? 

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.190
 tools that have evolved the most 

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.650
 to pass the time and with the passage of time 

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:16.419
 it has evolved a lot in relation to this 

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.850
 part you design visual interface on the 

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:20.890
 android we do not have one yet 

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:23.320
 The way you draw it means the 

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.450
 interactions and hierarchies between several 

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.760
 activities in your app 

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.500
 This is not only because the 

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.570
 government does not implement this is because 

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.010
 android this is a little more has one 

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.299
 bit more in depth with respect to 

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.190
 this issue rather the concept of 

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:39.039
 different concentration is not the concept it 

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:41.230
 It's more complex because 

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:42.970
 wants to be more flexible because you 

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.830
 has this exact mapping of a layout 

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.510
 for an activity does not remember what 

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.130
 make a tv and she stated her layout 

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.350
 she carries the royalties 

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:52.419
 at that moment android nothing prevents 

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.740
 given your tiger load layouts 

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:55.570
 different depending on the game or 

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.450
 some other factor eg tv can 

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:00.549
 decide whether it is based on some factor 

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:02.799
 some external factor 

00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:04.419
 she wants to load another layout then 

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:06.340
 it would be difficult to use a tool that 

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:07.659
 compile time knows what the layout is 

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.640
 that will be applied to characterize 

00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:11.230
 clearly out there but also there 

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.750
 already complicated everything you will have to 

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.520
 Use what you're doing. 

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:18.280
 after the wreck are being displayed 

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.909
 may increase between fragments of the river 

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.230
 kisses other things so he 

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:25.090
 remembering that this may change according to 

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.370
 with layout after which you should do the 

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.080
 higher time out threshold that meets the 

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.340
 phone, so that's how it looks 

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:32.380
 complicated we have 

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.720
 This way it's more work than 

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.909
 You'll make logic there yourself. 

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.440
 taking care of the beto shop possibly 

00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:40.330
 I would have more working than you care. 

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.279
 logic means manually 

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.840
 coaches the code is and when I say 

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:44.950
 again through the code means 

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.049
 sometimes it gives the impression that they have 

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.159
 that writing 200 lines of code is not 

00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:49.900
 only you 

00:25:48.159 --> 00:25:52.179
 are two or three lines of code for 

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:55.090
 accelerate when this TV ends 

00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:56.500
 This is ours, that's you. 

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.570
 It would have to be anyway I do not think 

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.429
 who did not want or not you would have to 

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.649
 expect this game in some way and it is 

00:26:00.429 --> 00:26:04.960
 exactly what to have when you create a 

00:26:02.649 --> 00:26:06.760
 new activity he already asks himself what 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.039
 the activity that is hierarchically parent 

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.539
 activity that is created and means 

00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:12.220
 that he is going to insert for you alone 

00:26:10.539 --> 00:26:13.659
 the code that allows you to navigate 

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.789
 parent productivity for example when 

00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:17.830
 You click the pen button then you 

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:19.750
 you have in your art a boat in 

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:23.020
 what button to pen when you click 

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:25.390
 in it the user should be taken 

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.130
 for activity parent that I 

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:30.159
 imagined a choice should show 

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.899
 some other activity there but not 

00:26:30.159 --> 00:26:33.520
 android you already specify if the time in 

00:26:31.899 --> 00:26:35.289
 that you creatively and automatically 

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.450
 code is implemented for you there in the 

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:39.370
 so the fact that it does not have a 

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.020
 visual diagram between activities and think 

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.390
 that I want to say oh I think it's a 

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.010
 thing that harms so much more than 

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.539
 Any way I think it stays with the movie. 

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.090
 crash on tt test 

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:50.649
 or better yet all of a sudden you that I 

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.380
 and you can create a tool that 

00:26:50.649 --> 00:26:55.659
 Does this or the bad as you are talking about? 

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.190
 does not seem repetitive but one of the things 

00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:59.320
 I like the android is the 

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.399
 open the system so if you think 

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.470
 that this tool will be extremely 

00:27:00.399 --> 00:27:04.450
 useful for developers and you do not 

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.399
 Do you want to wait, do not you see? 

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.929
 there is nothing prevents the fall from you will 

00:27:06.399 --> 00:27:09.820
 develop and launch this all of a sudden 

00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:14.950
 become a very successful tool and the 

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:18.039
 eclipse is also the same as the 

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:22.240
 eclipse plugins or a tool 

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:24.220
 is an interesting question like 

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.720
 does any versions how does it work 

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:30.250
 for all versions of android 

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:31.570
 all these works all ours is then 

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.549
 this is something we always talk about 

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:35.470
 I think at least everywhere that the 

00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:38.710
 we've done at least one 

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:40.210
 time ooo central android focus you 

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:43.240
 can not talk about android without talking 

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:45.280
 in diversity device in the a nodes 

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.780
 we do not have a mentality that has a 

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.679
 android device that is sure to 

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.150
 everybody, right? 

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:50.559
 if you remember when you released the nexus s 

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.059
 anybody else from the 

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:53.559
 Google said no, this is the 

00:27:52.059 --> 00:27:57.160
 device that will replace all 

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:58.720
 it's a lie, no, no, no 

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.070
 This is the best screen size for 

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.690
 who likes this screen size is the 

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.550
 Only thing I can say then 

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:06.040
 I liked the screen for me, it's the best 

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:08.290
 Breakfast was also quite convenient 

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.490
 but the we have to say a variety 

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.320
 of devices that we have in the 

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.870
 android is very big you have your 

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:17.170
 two small daughters until those have gugu 

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:19.480
 would have the android is very practical my father 

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:22.360
 for example he spent money bought 

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:25.030
 1 902 but did not like the screen there too 

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:27.910
 I got a galaxy 5 that is much smaller then 

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:29.500
 to him he the fire in the head two in the eep 

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:31.660
 but that is older treatment have 

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.330
 less memory but liked the size 

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.980
 so that the executive channel that is 

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.710
 What's in the name of a personal battle at 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.870
 sometimes it does not suit or can not be 

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.500
 ported to google tv not because 

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.780
 has 

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:45.790
 It's like you cut. 

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:48.670
 make sense a tv for example more 

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.950
 attractive a game of a kind of game 

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.800
 set of gps for example will have 

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:56.650
 behaved like this until you can 

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.870
 very strong and have a team gps on tv 

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.000
 and a battery in excuse now with that 

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.920
 of rochi in season after changing the psb 

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.660
 Does a bicycle that generates energy go 

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.640
 pedalando by são paulo or any 

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.010
 another city you go at the same time 

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.110
 You're feeding your tv and the TV has 

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:16.290
 gps and can use for example was 

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:19.330
 with her on tv here in places not here 

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.070
 It's just a matter of people having to take 

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.990
 he remembers bruno has a very selection 

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.360
 Good thing you presented together frame 

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:27.429
 Paulo in the goal of that year that a video 

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.010
 available online and that you 

00:29:27.429 --> 00:29:31.660
 only a lot of this is how to do it 

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.630
 on how to charge eclectic phones 

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.610
 be the coach completely will speak 

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.500
 a lot is talking a lot did not know how 

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.690
 carry three bikes and yes on 

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.190
 how to make the user interface that 

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.630
 are compatible like making versions 

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.210
 Android 

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.950
 remembering that the rule to make a 

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.559
 application should be compatible with 

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.780
 all versions as much as possible né 

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:55.580
 there is sold in the history of the club and 

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:56.990
 chrome is not compatible but then the 

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.910
 always careful to only do your app 

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.200
 be compatible with the maximum number of 

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.820
 versions possible 

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.680
 even if they are not all maximum 

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.050
 possible then precisely this 

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:09.080
 google talk what it's about is 

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.430
 just about is to interface the 

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.990
 that are compatible with the number 

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.750
 possible versions of android 

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:15.890
 This is very important, it's different. 

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.390
 developer who is afraid of 

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:19.190
 android diversity it for example 

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.300
 I'm here he came here he speaks my 

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.650
 God, I'm going to have to write one now. 

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.660
 application so it does not stay active 

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.740
 That's when someone says to 

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.800
 there is a third device 

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.150
 that were only on TV or have a 

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.500
 third one that is very similar to him 

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:32.180
 but it's a little bigger a bit more 

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.560
 wide he already caught he panics 

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.480
 starts tearing her hair now 

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.480
 I'll have to write an application 500 

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.040
 a thousand times it is actually the just 

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.070
 like android and has been thought since 

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.900
 start with adversity mind it all 

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.790
 the entire set of tools 

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.160
 android already thought for this he already is 

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:51.140
 thought of in a way that you can 

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.730
 without much additional effort he wrote 

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.280
 asking you to function equally well 

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:57.500
 tablet or cell phone on a TV or in a series 

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.780
 of devices said holguín and if it is 

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.460
 well-planned well-planned code in 

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.590
 yourself 

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.710
 Maybe you do not even realize that you made a 

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:09.050
 are you cut to different devices 

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.400
 because you can use the whole 

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.740
 question of US dollar resources. 

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.560
 recipes in your favor 

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:20.270
 and even charge you can write and 

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:22.340
 write no cut but also no 

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:24.800
 be afraid to stay alone afraid of us 

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:26.720
 go is not done just this in code since 

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.590
 that is correct were tips 

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.260
 cool 

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:32.480
 enjoy the features of android know 

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.250
 to use this is very important since only 

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.780
 remembering that the advice we give 

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.650
 We'll talk soon after, do not be afraid. 

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.840
 lif 

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.760
 according to the council be afraid because 

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.680
 Your books start to get very 

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.270
 complicated to get out is certainly because 

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.840
 something you ride is going 

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:47.120
 good 

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.650
 If you or if you were training well 

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.420
 then it certainly has a structure 

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:52.400
 better than I went to do that but 

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.450
 in the worst case, so in the worst case 

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.920
 cases when you are doing 

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.630
 application for multiple versions of the 

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.070
 android you will have to have 

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.810
 some activities they will be doing 

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:02.000
 different for example large 

00:31:59.810 --> 00:32:03.890
 device version changes are not 

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.720
 If you know what type you have a version of 

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.330
 your tv by brad another planet a 

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.960
 internal bureaucracy of another project 

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.640
 It's also complicated, I do not know what to do. 

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.010
 It's a complicated thing, right? 

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.110
 this is now if you have only two versions 

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.690
 one for example for the preview or bed and 

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:22.330
 another after more reasonable American-rj 

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:24.670
 so you may have to in the worst case have 

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:27.040
 that make a separation in two by two 

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.840
 for example in the era after the 

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.240
 nail in the field it is important not to 

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:33.670
 only a catch and if possible 

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.040
 keep pk only you keep all your 

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:38.910
 the issue of the history of 

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:45.570
 reviews of downloads is legal and 

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:45.570
 is forming your doctor question 

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:54.310
 gilson júnior de curitiba even more 

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:58.120
 specifics may come next, yes I 

00:32:54.310 --> 00:33:00.550
 wanted to make one out with list to use 

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.640
 chumba and such and can not make a 

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:05.140
 specific version the hypothesis of launching 

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.490
 a more specific product we have 

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.230
 the pleasure to help also stay at 

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.880
 I want you guys 

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:11.740
 now you just get confused by something that 

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.300
 I remember that we as a goalkeeper 

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.710
 already gave several talks saying to 

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.330
 everybody does not no you have to do 

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.430
 a small leftovers as you are talking about 

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:21.820
 will offer to make a very precarious 

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:24.730
 best in terms of cut rate 

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.530
 Only I remember that recently launched 

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:31.330
 google places launched just showed 

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:33.730
 sins that sense does it then the 

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:35.830
 sense of you and you throw many 

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.540
 apply is the following at the time people 

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.150
 You're always talking, do not make a 

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:42.730
 we only make a chair and after 

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:45.580
 Throw your ninth black goal ufop coke was 

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.110
 our logic in this is not is not is not 

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.970
 it was an accident being very easy 

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:51.310
 to pick up but this is the one I already posted 

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:54.330
 new has not been 

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:56.440
 is the following when you have the 

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:58.330
 some specific classes of 

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:00.220
 applications such as games 

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.080
 they have resources within them that are 

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:03.370
 specific to a certain certain 

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.440
 hardware features for example 

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.150
 one of the examples I always use is 

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.700
 shape and texture compressed in the 

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.800
 gospel notes how specific it is 

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.550
 in the form of textures included in 

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.240
 pdl 

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:17.800
 so in this case you have certain devices 

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.440
 in those a format and texture and others 

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.419
 that the use 

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.310
 the ep format to the video card in the 

00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:23.480
 truth differences through the law all 

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:25.970
 different people 

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.800
 so in these cases sometimes it's worth it 

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:29.450
 apply separately because otherwise 

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.700
 You'll have to put all the 

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.929
 textures for some device and all 

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.429
 the sectors to other positives within 

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:36.530
 of the same score only that the children 

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:38.200
 deaf on some little saved 

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.730
 hundreds of megabytes 

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:42.730
 especially about 3g super fast for 

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:46.940
 download 

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:49.429
 that is when the son of musicians 

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.050
 even home exists for a scenario and last 

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.800
 if that is the scenario if you really 

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:56.329
 Can not make a small one for 

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.980
 work because you're going to 

00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:59.329
 if you fall into those cases where you 

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.800
 have to do very specific things 

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:03.020
 for specific cases 

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.819
 then yes I use multiple apk if it can be 

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:06.859
 a good idea but as soon as 

00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:08.900
 routinely this should not be 

00:35:06.859 --> 00:35:10.010
 your first solution does not even sign on 

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:13.550
 second solution 

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:16.160
 when you when you make a 50 51 

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:19.040
 number 52 years later 52 solutions that 

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.420
 did not work and in the 53rd 

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.900
 accept you think make multiple 

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:27.140
 but it is a stay of the 53rd 

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:30.109
 Thinking about this incompatibility jean 

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:32.720
 Souza with your Brazil with the state here. 

00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:34.609
 he said the following part with 

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.609
 possibility exists an easy way 

00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:39.740
 use mep saw fragment by what 

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:42.290
 I researched a size but changed 

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:44.270
 online support and that's right 

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.950
 then to that question enough 

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.940
 frequency is just to summarize the 

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.190
 problem with that 

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.230
 is when you use a goal and saw it has 

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.700
 to take from one in category to 

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:54.349
 province is trying to put that 

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:59.230
 fragments our great value in the 

00:35:54.349 --> 00:36:01.640
 then there is a problem and in the 

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:03.710
 dance and when you are using the 

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:08.450
 pious shopping a flagrant 

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:10.150
 the solution then you will see that this 

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:13.010
 conflict 

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.960
 so there is no official way of 

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.030
 laws that is not how you download or 

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.010
 our support for it will not get out of the 

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.690
 box working though has a good 

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.130
 she is open source news 

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.140
 so you can make a 

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:25.760
 change in her if a rap is made in her 

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.020
 which is a well-known echo in the 

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:29.270
 true if you look for this I think 

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.069
 I do not know that the return must have I think 

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.000
 way to do this is that it is a 

00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:35.000
 way of you 

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.470
 Are you changing it from the father to the father of each 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.950
 class in a way that you can do 

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.450
 this is not it 

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.610
 but it is so answering the question has a 

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.320
 Easy way I think this is easy and 

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:45.590
 is not paper from all quarters 

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.990
 example they already lose it's nothing you go 

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:50.090
 will spend half of your day and having 

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.860
 problem with that now ask yourself why 

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:53.690
 have the official way of doing this using 

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:56.120
 the way she has it is in the 

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:57.890
 moment is not good but it is a movie that is 

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.450
 Frequently we're looking at this. 

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:00.920
 Our happy port is one of the other 

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.780
 areas that are very important for the 

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.280
 people then the crisis is always 

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.310
 improving it a lot we are 

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:09.350
 working now for example on how to 

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:11.090
 make this port happy and want to function 

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.640
 with edson barboza power to use action 

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:15.110
 boats through the superliga in 

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.170
 previous versions 

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:19.970
 That's what we announced in Brazil and the 

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.530
 We've been working on this a lot. 

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.970
 since then we still do not have a 

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.970
 prediction of when this will launch in 

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:27.380
 because it is a very complicated thing and the 

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.940
 people want to do it right it's no use 

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.040
 we throw a frightful thing 

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.290
 playing different version the luck that I 

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.970
 I think you make a version just goes 

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.410
 It might take a little longer 

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:38.870
 In this issue, we do not have a 

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.130
 prediction repeats tomorrow our colleague 

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:41.900
 It's going to launch, we're actually maybe 

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.460
 it may take you where you do not know where 

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.980
 He's and he's at his desk flipping. 

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:47.900
 now he knows we do not know anything but it's in 

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:49.700
 general is that engineering calendar 

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.280
 that you all know exists 

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:54.200
 released exists soon there never ever 

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.360
 certainly of his three administrations 

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.450
 certainly action bar in porto alegre 

00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:02.750
 It's going to be soon It's not even launched nor ever 

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:04.700
 certainly soon to the regal question 

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:09.920
 Is there a moment you have any more connection to? 

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:12.530
 person then the flag slipper has more 

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.000
 a question we do not have a question to 

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:19.360
 question where I'm from January 

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.360
 let's act the fashion sound and beauty beauty 

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:29.120
 android the company recently is that 

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.920
 was issued a version of the express that is 

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.640
 the fucking business that we use 

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.860
 been here right now and was released for 

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.380
 and of course what a software event is like 

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:41.060
 was asked why he did not have a 

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:44.120
 android version 

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:45.290
 only that the ninth case gives the boy what 

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.590
 made the system 

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:50.540
 he explained as soon as Google did not 

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.640
 do not know that some things in 

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.530
 that in my view, how I always participate 

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.880
 I did not think I did much of these lectures. 

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.500
 right direction 

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.200
 I just wanted to know about you how 

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.330
 works like this with the company android is 

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.730
 more so it does not support what the 

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.830
 sir putting so he expresses a 

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:09.290
 owner application that developed 

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:12.350
 a customer like this option that does not 

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:14.330
 they are entitled to question then the express 

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.670
 it's like you're an e-mail server 

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:20.000
 which is used for so state only 

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:22.160
 17 in the case of work for the government and 

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.870
 It's used for everything everything has to do. 

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.980
 with government is to use the express as and 

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:27.140
 among them 

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.430
 You understood that we have now released a version 

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:33.620
 for i is the one there, for example i 

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:35.510
 I work as a neighborhood but I 

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.580
 interested in learning I would like to 

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:39.440
 who knows the opportunity to 

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:42.440
 development for android 

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.490
 so I think that's the comment 

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.080
 the developer was that he did not 

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:50.210
 decided to ban because there is no support 

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:51.950
 of the egg is that the retreat is not because the 

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:54.050
 next is when he says there is no 

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.550
 support he may be meaning 

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:57.680
 several things certainly for example not 

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:59.690
 there is a line that does not exist 10 800 that 

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.220
 You pick up the phone and call soon or 

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:03.710
 having problem with this class other than 

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.890
 Understand that it was naomi, it does not exist 

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:08.450
 this in fact we do not have support in this 

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.820
 level because we believe the following 

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:12.350
 we want our platform to be 

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.760
 good enough you do not need to talk 

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:16.130
 with someone specifically for why 

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.270
 is giving trouble in Lebanon and one of the 

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.430
 our outbreaks 

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:21.860
 it means here with android or any 

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:23.420
 another thing is scalability ie we 

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:25.730
 we want to take courses and work from a 

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.800
 So that we help many people 

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:30.890
 at the same time then for us the 

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.750
 help a person individually wants to 

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:34.070
 saying it's worth less than if I can 

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:37.190
 a way day of god in the community 

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:38.510
 as a whole then for example up to 

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.220
 because if you have a common problem with 

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:41.480
 many people see having to solve a 

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.890
 only to ensure that they have a 

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.900
 solid platform 

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:47.180
 I think what we have every time 

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.460
 plus our support that the entity 

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:51.380
 another way the poles of the through 

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.120
 example of rebels such as this 

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.160
 what we give is in relation to improving 

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.950
 more and more our documentation then 

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.140
 if you go it still reveals to the taker 

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:00.730
 is to heat the documentation 

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.380
 android is very very full remember 

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.910
 that even before entering the goal I 

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.950
 know program very well android because 

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.859
 the complete documentation there means 

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:10.660
 You exist, you need very very little. 

00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:14.230
 more than what's really there 

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:16.720
 then love and so only one has 

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:18.579
 The issue of support is also 

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.560
 developed in trips both the hotel 

00:41:18.579 --> 00:41:24.760
 recently on google here completed a 

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:28.119
 month yesterday but so I was developing 

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:31.359
 android there since 2007 when the sdk came out 

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:33.460
 and I learned in this kind of thing the site but 

00:41:31.359 --> 00:41:35.470
 is the point is this is the question of what the 

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:37.570
 support our strong is subjective medium is 

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:40.599
 because so if you think it's a 

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:42.190
 server and is of the state and that 

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:44.800
 you must have a protocol if you do not follow the 

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:47.290
 standard protocol of medium is it could 

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.810
 to use the normal normal classes android 

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:52.420
 of access to the soccket falls in hypothesis 

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:57.820
 could include lower access and 

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:59.710
 only this via socket sent from brother-in-law 

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.359
 documentation and could make the customer 

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:03.849
 create so much that there are customers 

00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:05.140
 email to many in google places 

00:42:03.849 --> 00:42:07.839
 can download 

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:10.660
 so now if he expects a kind of 

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:12.220
 specific support is up to the bruno is 

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.380
 coming here to stay in 20 states 

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.670
 united and I'm going to stay officially 

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.500
 in Brazil as a channel 

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:20.290
 We've been doing some kind of support 

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.390
 as far as possible and blush cool faces 

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:25.630
 we respond that the technical cells 

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:29.230
 to see fire is not also the community 

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:30.849
 Android in Brazil is very strong, okay? 

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.310
 I'll quote a personal case later. 

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:34.869
 The staff at the 800 forgive me but she never 

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.640
 if you stay even that's what I founded 

00:42:34.869 --> 00:42:38.890
 the list you have a list called 

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.780
 android brazil should or not is official 

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.880
 google but there are over 1300 

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.410
 developers there like exchanging more 

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.200
 two messages per month 

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.790
 outside this has several blogs in several 

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.890
 sites also that does not suffer in this galera 

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:53.050
 gets engaged in pretty much like this 

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:55.869
 do not support the scale 

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:59.109
 of age gives the team support is a 

00:42:55.869 --> 00:43:00.760
 face to face there but personal as a 

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.920
 all for its free software gives a lot 

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.770
 good luck too 

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.690
 so it is and so we left 

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:07.740
 open to students if for example the person 

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.740
 have some because of some difficulty 

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.720
 specific is that we have this channel 

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:15.240
 from google apps to chat with 

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.950
 people and participate in senegal x knows the 

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:19.349
 people are trying to 

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.339
 maximum of 30 of supportcomm 

00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:22.230
 Brazilian families will certainly 

00:43:20.339 --> 00:43:24.450
 certainly is a very important thing 

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:26.010
 that the grandson mentioned is the century I 

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:28.650
 I'm blowing who does not know is 

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:31.680
 Talked this is maybe the point with it 

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:34.049
 and it's not a google tool ok 

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.000
 No, it's not a google platform anymore. 

00:43:34.049 --> 00:43:37.950
 I'm going to be part of our android team 

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.130
 is engaged in this platform to 

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:43.020
 answer questions just from 

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:44.280
 specific technical questions on the 

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.599
 example how does this work as 

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.930
 that works because that does not work 

00:43:45.599 --> 00:43:50.670
 like this 

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.410
 so I want to be with her, she's a 

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:54.000
 of our main support channels 

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.440
 So it is the rebels I do not think 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.510
 is with the sun is one of our channels 

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.579
 main health 

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.380
 recommends that this time I want 

00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:03.510
 if any player has any one 

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.280
 question is more complicated about 

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:08.280
 android it's worth you to post one 

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:09.690
 century the focus because not only what 

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.940
 say not only google support 

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:14.430
 how it sells from the android community as 

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.380
 strong right then trade is talking 

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:18.780
 I also think that the user community 

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:20.520
 and android developers is a force 

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:24.470
 gigantic no force means that 

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:26.970
 certainly the agent must say that 

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:29.190
 prestige with certainty then what the 

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.500
 people want like like google is not like the 

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.819
 android is not that the people who see you 

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:35.520
 people do not want to just come back for a stone 

00:44:32.819 --> 00:44:36.569
 1992 only we who know the android do not 

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.760
 I think it's this 

00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:40.290
 we do not want to be the evangelists 

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.670
 forever android everyone looks 

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.260
 We want what we want. 

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.569
 community members criticize the 

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.430
 community and the healthy ecosystem 

00:44:45.569 --> 00:44:50.400
 What many experts are there? 

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.109
 out of the goal and this is fundamental to 

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.359
 have a platform with critical mass 

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:56.040
 constant of defining and governing 

00:44:54.359 --> 00:44:56.609
 This is not the name of your 

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.230
 consulate 

00:44:56.609 --> 00:44:59.970
 obviously someone who already developed a 

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.530
 the e-mail client can question the 

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:06.059
 that this person has 

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:07.890
 so I do not think he does. 

00:45:06.059 --> 00:45:09.880
 have the support that he expected 

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:12.340
 google today 

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.600
 that was a specific right and so 

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:15.640
 we can not have been himself 

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.470
 had scales imagined Brazil is a country 

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:19.420
 of continental size 

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:20.530
 before it was just bruno now it's just me 

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.960
 I think we have to meet the 

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:28.290
 people the best way you can 

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:30.970
 but it is, and another is reiterating that 

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:33.310
 that specific person is the 

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:35.710
 developed something in contact 

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:37.270
 by the tel in the post put in doubt in 

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.220
 sense person to participate in the rescue with 

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.960
 We think this is interesting. 

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:44.380
 join in too 

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:45.760
 beauty has a thing right because everything 

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:47.500
 that saying everything we do not do is a 

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.500
 market opportunity still imagines 

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:52.660
 for example ooo which is cooler than 

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.490
 android is right on the us nodes 

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.020
 we want to be the owner of android do not want 

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.940
 everybody see the goal with us 

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.490
 we are the owners of android we want 

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:02.320
 to do everything is nothing prevents for example from 

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:04.300
 someone in brazil in any country 

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.280
 I counted on the android consulting that gives 

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.060
 just that 10 801 droid support that 

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.530
 we do not give 

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:11.050
 so there is a market opportunity 

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:13.900
 besides opening a company and many 

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:16.420
 minimum functions in Régis 

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:19.140
 The world does this by citing two 

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:22.240
 but they make money from the support 

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:24.400
 no it's not the linval torvalds wallet that 

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:35.220
 Did you have the phone to support? 

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:38.560
 a good symptom of a shame the last 

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:45.180
 bruno idea as a general idea and 

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:45.180
 very acceptable specific tool 

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:53.140
 is this possibility an idea I 

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:55.420
 I thought it would be interesting to 

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.860
 possibility exists there actually is 

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.110
 mathematically speaking there is a 

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:01.150
 an infinite and determined set of 

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:02.770
 keys you tighten fra you make the 

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:04.480
 interface become a reality that is 

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:08.170
 write her code and then post 

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.610
 But that's exactly the question. 

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.680
 It was very interesting because of that, right? 

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:12.430
 because if there is no such 

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.360
 idea is today 

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.920
 it means if you are not satisfied 

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.820
 with this idea can be an excellent 

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:22.150
 opportunity for you to create this is 

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:23.830
 the etf it is also public the eclipse is 

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.720
 think yes then you can inclusive 

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:28.960
 catch the eclipse that many companies 

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.280
 make it take the eclipse itself and 

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.400
 the pains that you think an idea 

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:35.950
 new né ô ô ô lucas dedé for example 

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:38.740
 hypothesis may have struggles with the idea 

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.600
 based on android we do not want 

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:43.050
 reduce or new zealand with the new year 

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.550
 will start in 2009 the company 

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:47.110
 remembers that pt does not do anything magical nor 

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.970
 movie team do nothing magic 

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.010
 because they call themselves the tools of 

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:53.440
 android is not android sdk 

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.300
 depends on the team is and only a notion to the 

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.190
 sometimes it is wrong that people have 

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.200
 teams from the 2nd android sequel 

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.880
 not true but it ends android is a 

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.220
 toolkit, eclipse is one of the 

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:04.930
 another thing and has a plugin detection of 

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.210
 eclipse that makes the bridge then 

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.190
 with the source sensor and then 

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.620
 command line for example only 

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:13.000
 like people like the face I think it's 

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.560
 a beautiful one is the terminal 

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.110
 so the guy goes there at the terminal 

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.620
 point bar to see something we found 

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.850
 that compile but you do not have 

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:24.250
 no restriction if you make another 

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.930
 idea now think the hotel is a sub 

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.280
 ask who I am there is interest 

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.750
 google to interface 

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.400
 android specific 

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:31.810
 It means at the moment we are 

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.120
 quite happy with what we have 

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:36.220
 now in the team but to have né 

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.050
 and you are very happy with the 

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.580
 system as a whole or is it has 

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:41.470
 people in eclipse have people not 

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.480
 understand smart try people 

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:46.120
 using for example the motor must have 

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.010
 people using the oracle you have 

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:50.290
 a series of 10 there that they exist 

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:52.330
 errors and which is better or not 

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.650
 in that religious discussion about cordel 

00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.870
 It's better, but what we want 

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:58.090
 just that this dynamic has this 

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.470
 and you have the freedom to do it 

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:00.370
 that you want to use the idea is that you 

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:02.200
 want to 

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.610
 If you're stuck there's nothing that we 

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.760
 People say no, that's the way 

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:09.010
 sure they do not think the android is you 

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.810
 you can choose the screen size o 

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:14.260
 phone manufacturer you can 

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:17.650
 to choose the lady's version is 

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:19.600
 school you want to use the 

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:21.010
 that fits best in this situation but 

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.110
 we at least currently do not 

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:25.600
 has no meaning but has no 

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:26.589
 none is any plan to have an idea 

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.680
 own dodo 

00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:31.839
 at least not at the moment I had 

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:35.319
 Question that is interesting is she 

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:38.049
 ask uncle s 

00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:39.759
 Good to gay tst I imagine that this 

00:49:38.049 --> 00:49:41.079
 question is how you get to use the 

00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:44.950
 android sdk 

00:49:41.079 --> 00:49:47.200
 then this just means to a 

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:49.869
 of interesting things of android is 

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.609
 that the documentation is very complete then 

00:49:49.869 --> 00:49:56.170
 if you go to candle to photograph 

00:49:51.609 --> 00:49:58.210
 dot com and you want to download apple if 

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:59.680
 You or you must be trying. 

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.210
 to rescue the story then I think 

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.200
 complete documentation to begin 

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.640
 develop from scratch 

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.440
 I remember when I started from scratch 

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.329
 go to android did not have difficulty 

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:09.369
 None like that is just you and the documentation 

00:50:07.329 --> 00:50:10.150
 it was much more rustic than it is 

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:11.349
 Not today 

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.729
 nowadays, for example, we have a 

00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:15.309
 something I did not have at the time I started 

00:50:12.729 --> 00:50:17.229
 What are those classes, freire? 

00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:19.960
 coast sit if you go in there 

00:50:17.229 --> 00:50:21.339
 model possesses now is so strange 

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:23.049
 back lessons 

00:50:21.339 --> 00:50:24.849
 step-by-step lessons 

00:50:23.049 --> 00:50:27.099
 how to perform some tasks on android 

00:50:24.849 --> 00:50:29.019
 such as well-focused topics 

00:50:27.099 --> 00:50:30.249
 for example to create victims 

00:50:29.019 --> 00:50:31.809
 create and load it 

00:50:30.249 --> 00:50:34.390
 enough then there's a class to 

00:50:31.809 --> 00:50:36.849
 this has those sentences and 3g is 

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:39.160
 this is important not only topics 

00:50:36.849 --> 00:50:41.499
 courses, but also classes and classes 

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.739
 shooting lessons and they have 

00:50:41.499 --> 00:50:46.779
 Fragment classes then have since 

00:50:44.739 --> 00:50:48.700
 then you have never developed the 

00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:49.779
 android is if you are interested 

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.839
 all you need to have one 

00:50:49.779 --> 00:50:54.819
 reasonable knowledge of java in the 

00:50:52.839 --> 00:50:56.650
 language that another Joshua obviously 

00:50:54.819 --> 00:50:58.029
 is outside the scope of our 

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:59.499
 explained that it is a class 

00:50:58.029 --> 00:51:01.749
 which is a reference 

00:50:59.499 --> 00:51:03.369
 there are several but I have up to 

00:51:01.749 --> 00:51:05.499
 resources but if you already have a certain 

00:51:03.369 --> 00:51:07.089
 familiarity with java is very easy 

00:51:05.499 --> 00:51:09.789
 you embark android through our 

00:51:07.089 --> 00:51:16.839
 documentation is certainly beyond the 

00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:19.059
 I have a question for you to do that. 

00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:23.319
 topic of a question 

00:51:19.059 --> 00:51:26.710
 the second is you lead to the classic 

00:51:23.319 --> 00:51:28.269
 the excuse is you're used so had 

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:30.489
 I do not know if it's the google tool 

00:51:28.269 --> 00:51:33.279
 I think it was that I wanted to app 

00:51:30.489 --> 00:51:36.130
 inventor of mit 

00:51:33.279 --> 00:51:38.200
 now it's the mit that takes care of him so the 

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:40.869
 Google gave up applying 

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:44.470
 so the film that had some partnership 

00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:45.790
 with something like this in the oec event goes 

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.470
 For those who do not know, he's making it up. 

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:49.630
 is a way for you to create a 

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:51.730
 middle android app to protest 

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:53.530
 a coffin android fast way to 

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.730
 everyone can create it what 

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.890
 happened to him was that the people 

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:58.780
 decided to shift our focus to other 

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:00.640
 priorities because the event is legal 

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:02.410
 for you to make your first prototype 

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.240
 android right né 

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.369
 but that's not a way for you 

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.730
 create a robust and robust 

00:52:06.369 --> 00:52:11.920
 ready for programming is more 

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:13.839
 is a tool that prioritizes the 

00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.150
 ease of prototyping on the 

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:19.359
 quality of the software then either 

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:21.190
 say the we've moved a little focus on the 

00:52:19.359 --> 00:52:22.540
 decided to focus our more is to stay 

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:23.890
 even to ensure that your 

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.810
 players had the best 

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:27.640
 tools to make gmail app 

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:29.109
 of production does not mean that the 

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.220
 event was poor does not mean that the 

00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:33.250
 people decided to change the focus a little 

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:35.109
 is only fahel the fact that he is the 

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:36.970

00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:39.040
 You can continue with it. 

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:40.570
 so we do not have anything against pepper 

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.990
 but it was only a change of focus that they 

00:52:40.570 --> 00:52:45.940

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:47.380

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.180

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:52.000
 the audience I wanted to enjoy 

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:59.109

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.800
