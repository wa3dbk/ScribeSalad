00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 Our program is special that 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 about games is that the game 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 in this edition made in Portuguese I am the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.580
 bruno oliveira I work in the team of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 blogger here in mountain view 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.760
 California 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.099
 I worked in Brazil before and I am 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 o neto marinho developer advocate 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.430
 Android stays there in Brazil along with 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 There you are based in são paulo a case 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 so there is a warning in this episode today 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
 we are going to give a general introduction 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.210
 It's about what goal I caught, I felt like talking. 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.610
 a little crisis from the point of view 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 technician is for developers and it is 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 are the airplanes that are available for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.090
 the 27 however was some introduction 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 Overall it's not about the service it's all over 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.899
 our main source of information 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 about for everything in the power of attorney is this 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 site here in what is our documentation 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.890
 google news service general 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.620
 just for you to see iraq bigger mr. 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.870
 in the developer.apple.com bags bar table 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.489
 this is the site in which you have 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.400
 time I almost think that almost all our 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 documentation is there dodo play game 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.970
 the staff was traveling platform of the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.890
 planet and did not see when it launched google 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.170
 playing games when it was released on 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.909
 and just remember that some game was 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.880
 Launched on google mobile, right? 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.759
 That's when we launched the service. 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.530
 It's cool and we can do what 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.970
 likes to give more prominence so pro 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.259
 people who develop games that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 suffering with some things that 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.710
 we have been keeping for a few days that the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.210
 truth where they play suffered with some 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.530
 things people in the mobile world too 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 it's not for sure 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 good to so most games have a 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.229
 even if it is a game that does not 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.970
 be competitive he has a certain 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.100
 competition and implied competitiveness 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.049
 that for example if you can reach 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.790
 at such a level only achieved so many 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.320
 points and then enter sometimes it's cool 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.210
 you put in the game for example the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.329
 creative concept between the concept of a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.399
 high-score grade 10 then sometimes make 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.020
 play the game much more interesting 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.700
 it's not because I use the player feels 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.869
 He is playing for something, right? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.310
 I'm not playing just to spend my 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.890
 Time I'm playing to put a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 chooses us to respond show my friends 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.229
 managed to make 6,000 points in that 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.300
 plaster game 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.890
 so sometimes it becomes too much game 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.130
 more interesting and talking about friends 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.290
 there is one thing too 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.910
 so I did not have to play alone with her anymore. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.980
 true to every comic, right? 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.990
 It's true then we also have a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.270
 a major part I think donated three 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.580
 games is just the multiplayer part 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.050
 So we have the whole family. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.760
 It's boring for you, that is. 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.460
 It used to be boring. 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.260
 keep a server and in c4 people then it is 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.910
 know if he received a call in the middle. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.870
 in the middle of the night claiming to be a server 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.760
 caught fire and quote is so 1990 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.010
 The longer a visitor is 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.600
 super excited by everything is going to fall your 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.940
 service because you're not waiting 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.770
 what traffic a thing there because there a 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060
 trainee data center stumbled across the river 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.010
 there it was only jonas 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.930
 so a very cool part is 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.430
 right from there the team very read 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.250
 so this we provide for free 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.080
 ie you just have to make phone calls 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.000
 perfectly free you can 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.950
 to play multiplayer between players 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.660
 including not only invitation multiplayer 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.760
 not the player's, it's never just 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.440
 invite friends also want the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.480
 concept of automatic right from the 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.340
 from which you can for example do 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.660
 a young player with random people 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.010
 and maybe you do not even need to meet and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.930
 in the circus of each other to 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.940
 able to play against each other and this 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.400
 It's very cool, it's about thinking proposal. 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.610
 so it's google was launched on 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.650
 google mail only works with android 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.150
 played for me, that's it, that's it 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.500
 this is what I would think if you hear 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.050
 about this service but not really 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.770
 we run natan android on 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.060
 this while the oab only then is one of the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.650
 great advantages of our service is 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.750
 just that it is that the four then 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.820
 you can write your game if you 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.970
 android web game play if you can 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.459
 do is integrate the three web platforms 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.590
 has no multiplayer 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.270
 android for now this to remember has 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.070
 some episodes of English were his 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.110
 mother her episodes that have an accent 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.260
 I do not go on time the west has tips 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.390
 2006 Exactly funny you see in 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.770
 android channel has a video about how 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.870
 do something for sna 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.610
 but it's because this service is you 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.440
 What more is it to listen to your friend and 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.390
 also unfortunately the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.459
 he also does not get can use service 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.260
 in games it's not exactly you 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.330
 meet sl players are people 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.060
 also can not be used for them that the 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.210
 Another game offers also works 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.650
 then this site is right here 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.540
 in your diet then here it is 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.340
 divided into this part 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.340
 general in the then if you are nobody 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.720
 with substance concept ahead 2010 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.940
 I think for us that we are accustomed 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.830
 with mystery games no reason is a 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.900
 something you can force to kill 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.510
 five enemies find without eating 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.639
 things is an upcoming event 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.690
 a cloud server a very cool thing in 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.150
 What diesel? 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.590
 This is very cool of course you see is the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.020
 next is just one way you 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.540
 can record the status of the progress of the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.370
 user on his google account then by 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.500
 example the user has already completed the six 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.729
 first levels your game you play 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.410
 this can not be useful later when the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.630
 player to play on another device in the 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.639
 he has another to hesitate tempted by 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.350
 example he will notice is that he will play and 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.910
 I suddenly know the first six 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.919
 levels are already a lot 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.360
 This is really cool because it eliminates 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.520
 one of the main factors that make me 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.350
 give up a game that main factor 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.910
 is the following I do not want to play 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.800
 the first world type of that game of 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.530
 new and he may suddenly be in the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.990
 him on the subway bus 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.630
 I think at home now on the board but 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.669
 o fai potala the level of blocked 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.300
 I always say that 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.460
 things is nature is has properties 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.169
 with cell phones or cell phones and 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.510
 They tend to fall in the water, do not care. 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.310
 be exceptional exactly they are 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.740
 attracted by liquids so it is so 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.750
 common yes I do not know there gives problems and has 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.610
 to change the new phone that you do not 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.590
 can live without and suddenly you stay 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.169
 without your levels is not this is not a 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.460
 it is a very bad experience then the 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.130
 observe the following here we have a 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.930
 a major difference here sometimes 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.520
 people ask but google no longer 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.840
 had a solution for Claudia before already 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.370
 did not have the drive that was just 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.750
 to write network state 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.220
 but it's that difference that people 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.050
 always say that the difference between a 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.850
 cheese grater and a chainsaw 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.530
 if you're trying to overturn a 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.000
 tree and build a house a roadmap 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.550
 cheese probably a good choice 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.070
 it's not impossible but I've already tried 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.050
 make the river does not use cheese grater 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.490
 to build houses will vote for 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.440
 but then but if you're trying 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.789
 roll the cheese for example, right? 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.139
 is obviously a player who is already very 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.639
 better because it does a chore 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.830
 even though it has less power than the 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.270
 that a select then certainly is clear 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.220
 which always has a little less 6 has 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.729
 less power than google drive sdk 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.710
 But it works for this. 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:36.979
 only for this are these orders made 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.379
 accurate - you actually record them only 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:42.650
 512 are 512k at this time you 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:44.449
 play 512k on the net and load it back 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.550
 that's just it works divided into 16 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:50.150
 shops including organizing want to save a 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.659
 slot slot in phase status slot 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.039
 we will not send the data as an object 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.189
 Big memory will send something. 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.059
 that your game is enough 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.349
 recapitulate that state he was 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.479
 at the moment you can send one 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.399
 cut a phase of something like this 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.930
 exactly is it you're going to send the form 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:07.969
 most economical possible to represent 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.979
 that state will not send a zip of the 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:12.800
 whole game because otherwise it will actually 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.899
 is that the marché was exactly what it is 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.159
 That's it, it's not going to work very well. 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:17.899
 what else we are entirely 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:19.430
 integrated game controller that fully regulates 

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:20.629
 integrated with google plus then 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.430
 example you can also use the service 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:23.809
 google plus like you 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.270
 you can do an interactive post by 

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:27.979
 example the player just finished 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.899
 that superficial level of your game that 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:31.339
 no one has ever gotten it before it can 

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.300
 pick up an office here in your game 

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:34.939
 may include, for example, 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.319
 functionality to enter the post that 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:37.879
 lets you post something on google 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.999
 plus with the consent of the user 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:43.879
 of course but it can encompass saying 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:45.469
 I got through this phase, it's so cool. 

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:47.330
 that this is not a direct drive to the 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:49.249
 your game in place twists another user 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.080
 that clicking that well does not have 

00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:54.169
 moreover a form of use to the 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.849
 users to advertise their game is well 

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:58.490
 cool even though the idea is precisely 

00:07:55.849 --> 00:08:00.439
 that and say 'we world trash 

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.279
 the players are always asking 

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.050
 for us 

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:04.879
 Ah but how do I do for the player 

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.039
 find out my game in my game is the biggest 

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:08.300
 history game already started already 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:10.069
 witnessed but only that no one is 

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.089
 playing has watched 20 members who 

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:13.279
 It's the personal matter of my office. 

00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:15.529
 but for this but playing the game because 

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:16.459
 and you can put the game stayed 

00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:19.639
 deserted, right? 

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:21.199
 to then in addition to putting the fifa match 

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:24.439
 there are many more have many more avenues 

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:26.209
 It's just for you to get this 

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:27.830
 to discover the feminine beauty is 

00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:30.279
 very new church can not choose 

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.440
 to bring Portuguese even 

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:35.060
 discover guilt skills at 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.979
 availability of the game one thing in the 

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.269
 ear that the prisoners - exactly 

00:08:36.979 --> 00:08:40.310
 exactly this is a show about 

00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:42.260
 Portuguese grammar for now 

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:43.789
 that's just it if you 

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.250
 including putting better multiplayer 

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.660
 still because what happens if I play 

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.279
 a game that is very cool multiplayer 

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.110
 invited grandson and grandson has no game 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.910
 installed what happens is that the grandson 

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.740
 will see on his cell phone he'll see a 

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:57.230
 notification saying something is not full 

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.330
 of inviting to the game x is this born 

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.640
 you click on it and you do not have the 

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.830
 game automatically the grandson goes pro play 

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.540
 store where it can download or x then 

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.880
 I'll get one more user there. 

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.040
 just because you've implemented multiplayer and 

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.960
 that's what we're aiming for 

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.790
 discuss game design because so but you 

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.040
 can sport in many ways as per 

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:18.380
 example asking the user to achieve 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.700
 more friends as an asset there too you 

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.670
 can drive this installation 

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:25.010
 the staff is in short order is a very 

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.350
 powerful that if well used can 

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.150
 to invent incredibly users and and in 

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.370
 a virtuous cycle where you have more 

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:33.529
 usual playing more regulation your ep 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.540
 your game and more people then install and 

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:37.550
 better every year 560 

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.170
 exactly then the crisis only has 

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.660
 advantages so far those have to 

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.400
 borges again he borges is that 

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.300
 thing that we as players already 

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.490
 We know 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.010
 we also have here the leading match of the 

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.870
 more advanced in the then give us here 

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.210
 we have a very important distinction is 

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:55.100
 between the public and social beneficial leader 

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:57.110
 it's not a very cool thing 

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.940
 next sometimes that public scrape 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.370
 sometimes there's always that guy 

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.339
 country that made 29 points and nobody ever 

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.810
 will be able to hit that school because 

00:10:04.339 --> 00:10:07.730
 nobody in the world has so much free time 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.960
 how to apply the team's motives 

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.370
 motivated campaign so that's why 

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.260
 it is also very important that you have the 

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.420
 social gogh leader he presents 

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.160
 among your friends who is who has 

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.770
 first that is second 

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.080
 although because with country caches 

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.360
 and we invited the largest donation was so 

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.250
 now if you've seen it right there 

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.050
 The cooler you are to see that I am what the 

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.550
 your boss is gone and you say no 

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.200
 has no reason in this universe for 

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.760
 What's your boss gotta have a singles on? 

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.500
 bigger in that game then you obviously 

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.640
 does what all the people I would do that 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.959
 you spend the whole next day 

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.720
 playing the drug 

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.100
 I liked your boss's choice is good 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.750
 then we have that session of 

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.310
 multiplayer at the then 

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.490
 here explains everything about how 

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:48.200
 do one means a lot of medicine 

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.880
 make the blood in make you will invite 

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.960
 friends do that thing that was 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.760
 talking that it's d 

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.590
 I take chinatel you find 

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.660
 people are automatically coming 

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.280
 play now to the details 

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.580
 again you see you come 

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.900
 then the documentation here is has the 

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.250
 people have the part of cetep also want 

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.200
 explain exactly how to do 

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.700
 configure your game and this does not 

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.260
 went into detail but this is just one 

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.910
 process a cake recipe will follow 

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.760
 step by step you set up your game 

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:15.830
 then if you put your exile in the 

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.700
 your android app you can start 

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.530
 to use p 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.630
 then has the specific documentation of the 

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.550
 android so far have documentation 

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.220
 detailed here how to make enem as 

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:28.640
 put the leather belt exactly I 

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.350
 I told you stay, so it means it's also 

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.100
 It was really easy for you to start using 

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.780
 this today is not 

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.850
 so it has no ipi reference has the 

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.560
 west part also on the internet about 

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.150
 absolutely nothing then this 

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.700
 Greek friend session for me, that who? 

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:42.080
 need to keep repeating has videos already done 

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.030
 in English 

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.490
 the staff asks in the comments there the 

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.290
 We have a project to make more books. 

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.120
 In Portuguese, nobody looks at 

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.720
 involves only dealing with bruno that is 

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.980
 a disaster 

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.140
 We've also taken some videos 

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.660
 byte at the team's debut soon 

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.880
 can also have a video game on stayed in 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.160
 connected there is also a web then 

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.840
 we do not forget the web and when 

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.390
 said I do not mean only web is like this 

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.070
 is not sobral read is a pickup sub 

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.060
 so you can call know from 

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.650
 Anything I can do 

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.270
 call robes if you want 

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.470
 implement a game that can play in the 

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.960
 your fridge 

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:17.210
 it is clear that in a game with those who 

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.610
 I signed up on March 25 th there 

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:21.110
 very little can invent because sometimes 

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:24.350
 can do embedded hardware 

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:26.780
 just like that is everything 

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:29.390
 sde decision with the platform to use 

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:31.580
 your weapons without any limitation 

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.690
 some things are reminding 

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.270
 android platform does not launch 

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.640
 web platforms is multiple especially 

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.990
 only have android on air will have logo 

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.730
 soon he is working on the projects 

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.010
 which has for now can have the social part 

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.900
 to sell active board which is already a good 

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:47.120
 seek on your stern game good part 

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.160
 decode sure then comes the 

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.310
 part of the world 60 is worth giving a 

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.540
 look at the whole site again the rb7 

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:56.510
 developer.apple.com baguim you just 

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.610
 there is everything there now another one I think 

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.690
 what is important is our website 

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.190
 ceps and android 

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:03.140
 not that the echoes of the other platforms 

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.529
 are not important but like me and grandson 

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.420
 job 

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:07.999
 android is highly always pulls the 

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.060
 Sergeant looks much less the shapes 

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:12.620
 exactly a master is exactly then 

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.269
 these are the android servants we also 

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.459
 we have time for other platforms and 

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:17.060
 has saline link on the documentation site 

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:18.889
 huh 

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.749
 we talked about android the question here 

00:13:18.889 --> 00:13:22.939
 It's the one on this site here that you can 

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:25.249
 find android time that is a 

00:13:22.939 --> 00:13:27.499
 site in the state that is not only here 

00:13:25.249 --> 00:13:28.699
 you can download the large ones as well as 

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:30.170
 if you find any bug 

00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:33.470
 setrans can send a patch to 

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.600
 To correct it anyway is the people, right? 

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:37.999
 joão vi the staff is with all the 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.620
 benefits already thought if you have an exam 

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:40.879
 detailed here about what the 

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.019
 that we have people time between 

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:43.790
 For example, they have a very 

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:45.829
 exciting flame button click 2000 

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.720
 soon you can compete with your friends 

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:48.470
 and see who gets more often a button and 20 

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.689
 seconds 

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:52.129
 Then yes for Christ, then I 

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:54.379
 modernization of the game is what to do with 

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:55.759
 that today I'm cool exactly where 

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:57.350
 we believe this goes from 

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:58.629
 redefine the concept of fun in the 

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.220
 21st century 

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:02.749
 Then there's another guy, it's about 

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.790
 certain cloud server has instructions 

00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:06.709
 detailed information on how you 

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.629
 including commands at inn including 

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:09.920
 how to set up an absurdity only you 

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:11.870
 to see the power of collaboration and 

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.059
 community who submitted the bild 

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.769
 program in biofuels was one of the 

00:14:14.059 --> 00:14:17.629
 community collaborator was not the 

00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:21.259
 people made the bild they sent the people 

00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:23.029
 put here because it works the other 

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:25.459
 other important seven here in 

00:14:23.029 --> 00:14:27.230
 url this is the goal from the last point with the 

00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:28.699
 bpp but I got on the phone 

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.709
 This is where we have our 

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:33.500
 call it so bring it if you are 

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:35.779
 which click on niches 

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:38.449
 the editing is our tracking process 

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:41.449
 you'll find a bug on the platform in the 

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:46.100
 the front bank neighborhood in the large in a 

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:47.689
 blog in the 21st century but the oxy can 

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.639
 correct directly but does not ask better 

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:51.050
 although the will but here are the 

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:53.540
 I'm dancing on the platform. 

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.279
 calling to those pillars that returns 

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.929
 to 7th is returning 76 

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:58.879
 So what's the problem, you two? 

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:00.829
 place here in Iceland before a 

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:02.720
 personal search make the cake suddenly already 

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:04.459
 with whom you have reported this bug you can 

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.519
 including the status of when 

00:15:04.459 --> 00:15:09.020
 will quit whether it was submitted not if you 

00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:10.880
 found a blog 

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.490
 of toulon play so the dollar climb 

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.830
 about this can he have submitted 

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.870
 a lot of collaboration from you exactly 

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.940
 that the other is another very 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:21.680
 important here is the following we have and 

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.050
 What happens if you have a question 

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.810
 every game I'm starting with games I 

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:29.060
 I'm lost in the middle and I do 

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.310
 exactly then for this the best place 

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.830
 to ask your questions and you are not 

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.330
 who revealed it in the only dishonor 

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.370
 Confessed, we have a tag now. 

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.020
 specific for the goal I got myself then 

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.210
 Are you guiding your question with this? 

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.500
 tag some member I do not know that our 

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:44.270
 staff here will probably see you at 

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.680
 very small period and if people 

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.600
 know how to respond he will respond in the 

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.950
 so stood out and it was this one this is 

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.630
 the list of all questions that do not 

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.610
 we pay with playing games and remembering 

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.930
 if it is android also can not win 

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.910
 with android there is also the 

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.340
 android also to end up seeing it there 

00:15:55.910 --> 00:16:00.080
 play is that potential answer more 

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.520
 fast and yet clear of the whole 

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.140
 community is watching that there you 

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.320
 can use a player in the future who has 

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.780
 the same doubt that you were doing well is very 

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.370
 good power with collaboration and exact 

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.530
 is for example our list of 

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:15.830
 questions they are not clear and sun 

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.570
 about the blow and then obviously the tags 

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.160
 are not exclusive so if you have to see 

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.230
 with the other game and android then you 

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.840
 can pay with android and gol took me 

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.670
 make it as attractive as you can 

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.040
 to see people interact enough 

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.170
 I'm not even in the 

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.820
 people interact enough with the community 

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:37.040
 answering question if she is very 

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:38.420
 well inclusive good reputation blows 

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.600
 now let's determine one 

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.580
 demonstration is this here is a is a game 

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.370
 is to see that we wrote here just to 

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.230
 demonstrate how it works I'll increase 

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.030
 the volume here it sounds pretty retro 

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.920
 so it's a game in which you have to 

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.570
 draw on things you have to take 

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.910
 in these little green things are aliens 

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:57.980
 who are mauro you are protecting a 

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.080
 lighthouse then you have to shoot us 

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.640
 virus that you can not take the packets 

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.710
 of data that are the squares to 2 

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.480
 This game is played live not if you 

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.390
 you are interested in playing the address here 

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.550
 bdco brings the code pointed to spot.com 

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.110
 then you can play the 

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.959
 will as long as you do not go take it 

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:16.760
 high score is not going to be forced to 

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:18.179
 stay the next day interpretation is 

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.769
 a lie, I actually was 

00:17:18.179 --> 00:17:21.209
 I already leave the leader board of this 

00:17:19.769 --> 00:17:23.610
 because there are people with stories 

00:17:21.209 --> 00:17:25.889
 absurdly great to leave then if you 

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.689
 go here and want to play, you can play 

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:33.629
 here is just the game, right? 

00:17:27.689 --> 00:17:37.019
 the note is a super retro thing does not have 

00:17:33.629 --> 00:17:39.919
 that kill these animals in the effects 

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:39.919
 by george lucas 

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.330
 if you can get a body 

00:17:42.389 --> 00:17:47.070
 if you can get there but you can 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.909
 make a combo of 12 he is 

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.549
 destroys 

00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:52.259
 so I'm going to stop being there until then 

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:54.690
 they start the headlamp direction 

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:56.460
 this is good if you take advantage of a 

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.539
 Data package 

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.769
 now has also got a debut of course 

00:18:00.539 --> 00:18:03.929
 because not even a complete game will be 

00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:07.950
 Then I'll have be here and you 

00:18:03.929 --> 00:18:10.580
 need to figure out how to do it and then 

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.580
 notes 

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:18.950
 every game has to have a good game and 

00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:18.950
 now this loss again with stories the 

00:18:19.249 --> 00:18:24.509
 fantastic and scores the year 

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.879
 then note that here for example has a 

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:28.799
 recreational activity on the list of 

00:18:26.879 --> 00:18:30.690
 all the assets I got in that 

00:18:28.799 --> 00:18:32.749
 list goes on the web what is interesting 

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.159
 next in android in the west we have 

00:18:32.749 --> 00:18:37.080
 interfaces beauty in the system you can 

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:38.940
 will make a method call you only 

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.019
 can display a giant screen in the 

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:42.119
 time we do not have because normally 

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:44.460
 the experience of the game she and a friend in the 

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:45.659
 straw to use with it exactly here 

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.220
 For example, God wants to see the same is 

00:18:45.659 --> 00:18:48.809
 super easy because you carry the 

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.330
 cruise borges has a codec you 

00:18:48.809 --> 00:18:54.509
 again on your web is to be able to make a 

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:56.460
 console yourself in rivers behind may 

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:59.100
 play and went to make a console to do 

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.440
 An example robot games will receive other 

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.249
 conditions to use platforms you want 

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:07.259
 here is a list of blows, right? 

00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:09.330
 including also live and had the duty 

00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:11.610
 cool to see you're fantastic 

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.950
 so from here it's just that 

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.980
 social part and not only my friends and 

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:19.139
 right-hand side is just the public leader in the 

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.659
 So you can usually see that I 

00:19:19.139 --> 00:19:23.879
 I'm on the list my friends are me 

00:19:21.659 --> 00:19:26.100
 I am here on the public leader list 

00:19:23.879 --> 00:19:27.900
 under 8,600 I'm well below that 

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.450
 No, I have to work hard. 

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.800
 The front is what I think is good 

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.090
 here is the difference button and if not 

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.920
 work then you can do 

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.420
 alone through here but I'm already 

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.970
 leaving so you do not have to do anything here 

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.250
 and I think that's more or less what the 

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.750
 People had to talk today, I think the 

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.370
 The idea is precisely not to make a 

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.870
 personal presentation on google 

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.110
 playgames I do not have an order here 

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.880
 Thank you very much Brazil for 

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.010
 help them with this presentation I think 

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.630
 the staff will now enjoy having a 

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:57.450
 notion of what he can do with google 

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.280
 playing games and then I was at ease and 

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.860
 destroy with your ideas 

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.360
 exactly then is this here with the leader 

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.850
 continent, especially with 

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.770
 returns and note you can give a 

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.390
 much better difference for your people. 

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.250
 user of your game there 

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.260
 It's good that the team could be difficult. 

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.930
 implement in the game no more cloud 

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.970
 server whatever works is super easy is just 

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.220
 put it just put type one line of 

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.320
 code in the right places and you know 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.600
 so hard you can just have 

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.910
 all this additional engagement with the 

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.520
 is that you could not do without 

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:34.200
 That's it, then, I guess. 

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.790
 message if an agent in the plus is 

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.770
 a detailed look here in our 

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.240
 documentation so remembered here the site is 

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.070
 only vote for the main site 

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.050
 I want her down here, she got with 

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:46.170
 belly barbarian services and has it all 

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:47.550
 Thank you so much, I'm a grandson there. 

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.030
 I'm bruno oliveira until next time. 

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.030
 next
