00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.940
Despite being kids movies, Disney films have
a reputation for including dark elements like

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.760
the death of a parent or villains hiding behind
a pretty face.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.560
But the original stories many Disney movies
are based on are even darker and more gruesome

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.160
than what makes it into the final animated
feature.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.700
We've already gone over the twisted tales
behind Cinderella, The Little Mermaid, and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.259
other popular animated films, but we've got
even more dark stories that inspired Disney

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.259
movies.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.550
Stick around until the end for a link to our
other video about Dark Disney Stories!

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.910
Here is Screenrant's Dark Disney: 10 REAL
Stories Behind Popular Disney Films Part 2.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.140
Peter Pan

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.100
In addition to the 1953 Disney movie, the
studio released a sequel in 2002 and spun

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.310
the story off into an entire franchise surrounding
Peter Pan's pixie friend Tinkerbell.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.670
However, the one question Disney's Peter Pan
skips over is what happens to the Lost Boys

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.600
when they decide they want to grow up.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.739
Maybe Peter sends them home?

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.070
According to the original novel by J.M. Barrie,
that isn't the case, instead, "when they seem

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.549
to be growing up, which is against the rules,
Peter thins them out."

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.840
It may not explicitly say Peter kills the
Lost Boys when they get too old, but the phrasing

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.560
is too menacing for it to mean anything else.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.549
So Neverland isn't just fun adventures and
avoiding responsibilities, after all.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.289
Pocahontas

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.180
Borrowing the basic story structure of star-crossed
lovers from Romeo &amp; Juliet, Disney's Pocahontas

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
tells the story of colonist John Smith and
Native American Pocahontas who fall in love

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.229
despite their different beliefs and a language
barrier.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.799
When Pocahontas' father captures and plans
to execute John Smith, Pocahontas saves him

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.709
and manages to unite the Native Americans
and colonists.

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.961
Of course, according to history, that's not
how it actually went.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:55.149
When John Smith arrived in America he was
in his mid 30s while Pocahontas was around

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.380
10 or 12 and they never had a romantic relationship.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.759
Instead, Pocahontas was kidnapped and forced
to marry the Englishman John Rolfe as well

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.209
as convert to Christianity and change her
name to Rebecca.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.560
She died in her 20s from unknown causes.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.830
We may like the version of this story that
includes learning to paint with all the colors

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.730
of the wind, but history wasn't as kind to
Pocahontas.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.730
Beauty and the Beast

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.040
The third film from the Disney Renaissance,
Beauty and the Beast stays close to the original

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.680
text of the fairy tale about a beautiful and
kind young woman who falls in love with a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.599
prince that has been transformed into a beast.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.700
However, some changes were made from the original
story, like the inclusion of Gaston, and Belle's

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.349
father being portrayed as an inventor rather
than a merchant.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.180
Another big change is the exclusion of Belle's
two wicked sisters.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.849
In the original story Beast allows Belle to
return home to visit her family for a specific

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.269
amount of time, but when her sisters see that
she's well-dressed and well-fed they ask her

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.379
to stay longer hoping the Beast will be so
angry with Belle that he'll eat her alive.

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.549
And you thought Cinderella's stepsisters were
wicked.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.549
Although the sisters are successful in keeping
Belle away from Beast, she finds out that

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:56.549
staying with her family has caused the Beast
to nearly die of heartbreak.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.549
She returns and they live happily ever after.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.549
The Fox and The Hound

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.049
Disney's film about a fox named Tod and a
hound dog named Copper is a tale of friends

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.620
who grow up to be enemies because of their
own natural animal instincts and the pressure

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.909
of their owners.

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.190
This Disney movie doesn't necessarily have
a happy ending, but it is much less sad than

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.769
in the original novel by Daniel P. Mannix.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.290
In Disney's version Tod saves Copper from
a bear, then when Copper's owner, a hunter,

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.921
tries to kill an exhausted Tod, Copper protects
his old friend and the two live happily, if

00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:24.650
separately ever after.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.069
In Mannix's book, the Hunter trains Copper
to track Tod after the fox cased the death

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.069
of another of the Hunter's dogs.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.880
Copper ends up chasing Tod until the fox collapses
from exhaustion and dies.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.150
Then, when the Hunter moves into a nursing
home a few years later, he kills Copper with

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
a shotgun.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.099
If you thought Disney's version of The Fox
and The Hound was sad, at least they changed

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.099
the original ending of the story, which is
so much worse.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.260
The Jungle Book

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.650
Disney's The Jungle Book is the tale of an
orphaned boy raised by the friendly bear Baloo

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.519
and panther Bagheera.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.670
After a series of trials in the jungle and
being pursued by a man-eating tiger, Mowgli

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.190
returns to civilization in a nearby human
village.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.760
However, in Rudyard Kipling's original books
that's not where the story ends.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760
Mowgli is introduced in Kipling's The Jungle
Book, a collection of stories, but one short

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.810
story in The Second Jungle Book sees Mowgli
banished from the village after he's accused

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.340
of sorcery, with the villagers planning to
torture his animal family.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.939
To get revenge, Mowgli enlists the animals
of the jungle to destroy the village's fields

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.030
and food supply before eventually setting
loose a herd of elephants that destroy all

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.540
the village huts, sending the villagers fleeing.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.859
He didn't even leave the bare necessities.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.890
Mulan

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.550
The story of the Chinese heroine Mulan dates
back centuries and each version follows roughly

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.250
the same storyline: when the army calls on
a member of each family to serve, Mulan takes

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.880
her father's place because he is too old and
her younger brother is child.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.670
Mulan fights as a warrior for 12 years and
only reveals herself as a woman to her comrades

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.740
after being welcomed home by her family.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.210
However, one tale features a different ending
in which Mulan returns home to find her father

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.210
has died and her mother remarried.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.210
Although that's bad enough, it gets even worse:
Mulan is summoned by a foreign ruler to be

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.030
his concubine and instead of going, she commits
suicide.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.420
Not the happiest ending for such a renowned
warrior, but fans will be happy to know this

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.660
ending only appears in one version of the
Mulan legend.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.640
Tangled

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.990
The most famous version of this tale was written
by the Brothers Grimm, which was violent enough

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.590
since it featured the Prince in the story
going blind after falling into some thorn

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.590
bushes.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.420
However, the villain in this tale, Dame Gothel,
gets a fairly tame comeuppance compared to

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.160
Basile’s 17th century telling of the story.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.220
In this version, the girl is taken as retribution
for her mother stealing parsley out of an

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.580
ogress's garden.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.020
The rest of the story is similar to the one
we all know but in this telling, the girl

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.450
- named Parsley for the plant her mother stole
- escapes using three enchanted gallnuts.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.380
As Parsley and the Prince are running away,
she throws each gallnut in an attempt to distract

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.600
the ogress and they transform into three animals.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.760
Though the ogress outsmarts the first two
beasts, the last one, a wolf, swallows her

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760
whole.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.050
So, by comparison, Mother Gothel had a much
more Disney-fied death scene - with no animal

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.050
violence involved.&nbsp;

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.460
The Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.830
Disney's version of The Hunchback of Notre
Dame isn't exactly known for being one of

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.060
the studio's lighter films since Quasimodo's
mother is murdered by Frollo on the steps

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.440
of a cathedral and the minister of justice
later sings about being damned to hellfire.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.160
However, Victor Hugo's original story is notably
darker, which shouldn't surprise anyone since

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160
Hugo also wrote Les Misérables.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.170
In the original novel, Esmeralda is charged
with the attempted murder of Captain Phoebus

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.920
and sentenced to death.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.430
Although Quasimodo is able to offer her sanctuary
in the cathedral for a time, Frollo eventually

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.380
hands her over to the authorities.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.930
When Frollo laughs while Esmeralda is hanged,
Quasimodo pushes him off of Notre Dame, then

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.220
finds Esmeralda's body and stays with her
until he dies of starvation.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.590
Again, this is a Victor Hugo story so the
fact that everyone is dead or miserable by

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.590
the end shouldn't be too surprising.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.900
Hercules

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.520
Disney's take on the Greek mythological figure
of Hercules focuses on the demi-god's transformation

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.110
from zero to hero (in no time flat).

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.780
For his love interest, Disney adapted Hercules'
first wife Megara into a spunky but conflicted

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.810
heroine who won't say she's in love.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.150
But, by the end of the film, Hercules and
Meg ride off into the sunset to live happily

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.430
ever after.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.810
In the original myth, though, Megara's love
isn't won over by the hero, she's given to

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.700
him as a gift for saving Thebes.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.310
Plus, in an even darker turn to their story,
Hercules kills their children during a temporary

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.990
god-induced madness and in some versions kills
Megara as well.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.060
In general, it's not the kind of material
suitable for a Disney movie.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.060
The Princess and the Frog

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.870
The Disney version of the classic tale of
a princess and a frog is changed significantly

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:15.060
from the original to be set in 1920s New Orleans
and instead of changing the prince back, a

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.790
kiss turns Tiana into a frog herself.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.290
Though true love's kiss does the trick in
the end, the original folktale of The Frog

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.480
Prince sees a number of other methods used
to turn the frog back into a prince.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.330
In the Brother's Grimm version, the princess
throws the frog against a wall, while other

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.230
tales see the princess chopping off the frog's
head or burning its skin, both of which trigger

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.230
the prince's transformation.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.230
We don't want to tell the storytellers how
to do their job, but a kiss is definitely

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.230
a much more kid-friendly way to break a spell.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:38.230
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.460
