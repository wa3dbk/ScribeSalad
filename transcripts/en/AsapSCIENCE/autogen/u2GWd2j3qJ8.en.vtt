00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.420
 With more than 300,000 species of plants on the ground, there is no doubt that they have a high degree of sophistication 

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.420
 With more than 300,000 species of plants on the ground, there is no doubt that they have a high degree of sophistication 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.370
 It senses survival and growth. But while some of its features can be compared in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.219
 Taste, sight, touch and smell, including humans, have you ever wondered - can plants think? 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.870
 On the ground, the cumulative total of plants is 1000 times higher than the animals. But 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.480
 These plants are unable to move, and can not move around their environment which is, apparently, 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.050
 This is one of the disadvantages of evolution. This forced the plants to adapt in amazing ways 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.410
 Which often pass unnoticed before the naked eye. 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.960
 Do you smell bad? Plants also smell it - and react with these chemicals in the air. 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.559
 For example, when the fruits begin to ripen, they release a chemical called ethylene. And when 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.149
 The nearby fruit senses this pheromone, ripens faster, so that all fruits can mature 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.030
 At the same time. Plants also release some odors that attract insects to spread pollen. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.109
 Especially the amazing jiffy flowers they develop delicate bristles, warm and have a smell like 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.800
 Rotting the body in an attempt to imitate the dead body. Leading to attracting flies and beetles 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.109
 As pollinators. 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.620
 On the other hand, when the propellant is attacked by an insect, animal or disease, it is known. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.609
 When animals feed on acacia trees, they are quickly returned by producing chemicals called 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.299
 Tannins, which make their leaves unpalatable and difficult to digest. Some even produce enough 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.070
 Of poison to kill the animal. Perhaps more impressive is what some of the corn and cotton plants do, which when done 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.100
 Eaten by caterpillars, excreted chemicals in the air attracts parasitic wasps, who 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.070
 Flyers intervene in the position and eventually kill insects at a certain level, they continue with wasps. 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.990
 As much as this seems crazy, even sound recordings of caterpillars chew the leaves, triggering the plants 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.810
 Even without any form of touch, the plants show a reaction, as if they can hear. 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.090
 On a large scale, plants also work together. A network of underground fungi can reach the roots of trees 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.609
 In the forests, allowing them to exchange food and information. Using isotopes 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.490
 Radioactive, scientists have discovered that trees share water and nutrients with other trees in need 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.289
 Large shaded trees feed the smaller ones until they become tall enough to reach the sun, and 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.850
 Trees that remain green throughout the year are involved with food trees that lose their leaves 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.020
 In the winter - to help them during this season. And then these trees repay their religion in the summer months, 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.280
 Such as transaction exchange. Some scientists describe this as "a vast network of wood." 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.939
 Perhaps the most shocking fact is that some plants have a memory 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.750
 , Are those leafy plants that close when touched. This reaction is intended to intimidate 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 Insects do not even land on them. In an experiment on these reactions, scientists have observed that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.819
 When it drops from a height of 15cm it closes what the group hits. This is not surprising. But 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.590
 After repeated dropping them 4 or 5 times, some of the plants stop shutting, as if they are 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.790
 I realized that this incentive was not harmful. If it is shaken instead, it closes, 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.209
 But at any time dropped from the same height, they remain open. This effect continued 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.480
 For weeks - plants have memories. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.830
 Of course, plants do not have brains or other cells and devices that we consider necessary to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.200
 For intelligence. The brains and neurons are irreplaceable, but the plants are unable to move, and often attack, 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.819
 Therefore you must be able to survive after you devour or destroy part of it. Brain only 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.330
 Will not work. But if you measure intelligence or think that it is the ability to solve problems, 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.730
 Interact with the environment, even work in groups, if the plants are incredibly intelligent. 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.480
 It's something to think about next time you chew a piece of cauliflower! 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.519
