00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.140
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.780
Today's lecture
starts off with what

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.260
probably is the single
most important topic

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.100
in the entire course,
not just to date,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.920
but in the entire course.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.720
And it's a rather sneaky
thing in the sense that

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.640
takes a while to grow into it.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.390
Things have been going so
smoothly so far, that perhaps

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.250
this point is going to be a
little bit subtle to make,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.770
and we'll try to lead
into it gradually.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.620
There are probably ten different
ways to introduce this topic.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.150
And whichever one
you pick, I think,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.680
any one of the other nine
would've been better.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.510
But without any further ado,
let me talk about today's lesson

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.770
in terms of something called
the directional derivative

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.360
and indicate, in a
manner of speaking,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.590
that when we deal with
functions of several variables,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.020
especially in the
case that n equals 2,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.150
there is a very obvious
geometrical interpretation, one

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.380
that we made some use of
in the previous lecture,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.010
but which I hope
to make more use

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.430
of in this particular lecture.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.300
Let's take a look and see
what the situation is.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.120
Let's suppose I'm given that
w is a function of the two

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.300
independent variables x and y,
and I have that w is therefore

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.260
some function of x and y.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.310
And I can now talk about
the graph of w, which

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.870
we assume is some surface.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.900
And I've drawn it in
this particular way.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.960
I take some point a
comma b in the xy-plane

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.170
on which f is defined.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.820
And at that particular point,
I go to the corresponding point

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.960
on the surface,
which I call P_0,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.530
which has coordinates what?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.820
a, b, and c, where c is
simply f of a comma b.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.850
That, of course, is how
you graph a function

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.910
of two independent variables.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.710
The w coordinate, so to speak,
is simply the functional value

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.050
of the x- and y-coordinates.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.140
Now, what we did last time was
we essentially said, lookit,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.470
if we were to slice this
surface by a plane which

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.240
was either parallel to the
wy-plane or to the wx-plane,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.980
we get special curves
of intersection,

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.810
and we use this to indicate the
idea of partial derivatives.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.997
Now, without too
much imagination,

00:02:56.997 --> 00:02:58.580
I think it should
be very easy for you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.390
to visualize an arbitrary
surface over your heads.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.230
You're standing in a
particular point on the floor.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.290
At that point on the floor, you
visualize a coordinate axis,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.670
which we'll call
the x- and y-axis.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.970
Now, obviously, you can move out
from the point at which you're

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.940
standing along the x-axis.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.260
You can move out in the
direction along the y-axis.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.350
You can visualize
that how rapidly

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.190
the height above your head
is changing as you move out

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.420
certainly will depend
on whether you're moving

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.170
along the x-axis or the y-axis.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.840
But the key point-- at
least, the key point

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.150
from the point of view
of today's lecture--

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.070
is the fact that why were
you restricted to either

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.370
of these two directions?

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.620
Why couldn't you
have moved in any one

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.020
of infinitely many
different directions,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.030
namely from the point at
which you're originating,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.040
you can move in any direction
at all, because we're assuming,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.200
at least, that the floor
on which you're standing

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.440
is continuous.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.310
It's unbroken.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.230
You can move in
these directions.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.610
And the idea that you get
can be shown pictorially

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.900
by saying, lookit.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.570
Let's assume that we're
at the point a comma b.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.250
We have this surface over our
head just as we did before.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.620
But now, instead of picking
a direction either parallel

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.459
to the wx-plane or
to the wy-plane,

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.230
let's pick some arbitrary
direction s in which to move.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.620
And now, what I'm
saying is if I now

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.470
take the plane that passes
through this direction

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.370
s perpendicular to the
xy-plane, that plane will also

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.580
intersect this surface,
passing through the point P_0.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.790
I get a curve of
intersection, and I

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.242
can talk about the slope
of that particular curve.

00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:48.700
See, ultimately,
this is what we're

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.783
going to be talking about.

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:52.180
Now, what is the slope
of that particular curve?

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.500
Well it's a derivative.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.060
It's a derivative of
w with respect to s,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.090
where all of a sudden we've
now chosen the s direction

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.120
over here to be what
we're going to take

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.110
our derivative with respect to.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.720
In other words, it
seems to make sense

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.890
to talk about the derivative
of f in the direction of s,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.320
evaluated at the
point a comma b.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.260
In other words, just like we
talked about f sub x of a comma

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.160
b and f sub y of a
comma b, why can't we

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.220
talk about the derivative
of f evaluated at a comma b,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.050
in the direction of s?

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.620
And if we want to correlate this
with the notation in the text,

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.420
observe that we call that dw/ds.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.440
By the way, notice-- not the
partial of w with respect to s,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.570
but the derivative of
w with respect to s.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.780
Remember, the partials
were essentially

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.190
defined in terms of holding
either x or y constant.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.820
Notice that in our general
directional derivative idea,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.470
neither x nor y is
being held constant.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.910
Notice that x and y are
varying as we move along s.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.730
Notice, also by the way, that
once x and y are restricted

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.930
to move along s, they are no
longer independent variables.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.650
It's a rather interesting point.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.410
We talk about w being
a function of the two

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.990
independent variables
x and y, but as soon

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.710
as we pick that direction
s in the xy-plane,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.709
x and y have to be very
specially related-- namely,

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.750
according to the equation
of a straight line that

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.450
determines s-- for that
point to be on the line.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.016
And that's why we
talk about dw/ds.

00:06:35.016 --> 00:06:38.040
w is a function of
a single variable

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.110
once you restrict yourself to
the particular direction s.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.970
At any rate, the question that
we want to come to grips with

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.950
is, how do you find dw/ds?

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.640
Well, here again is the beauty
of our logical structure.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.890
By definition-- this is the
same definition we knew early

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.605
in part one of our course.

00:06:55.605 --> 00:06:59.890
dw/ds, by definition,
is the limit as delta

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.450
s approaches 0, delta
w divided by delta s.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.790
Now, the thing is, what's
very difficult to compute

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.420
in real life is delta w.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.465
After all, this w,
being f of x, y,

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:17.030
f can be a very, very
complicated surface.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.360
And to actually find the true
change in w-- well, heck.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.060
We already saw this in part one
when we compared this delta y

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.540
with delta y tan.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.800
To actually find the change in
y was a much more difficult job

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.470
than to find the change
in y to the tangent line.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.490
What we're saying
here is, lookit.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.340
We already know how to
find the change in w,

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.080
not to the surface,
but to the plane which

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.650
is tangent to the surface
at our point P sub 0.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.820
In other words, we
have already discussed

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.100
that delta w tan
is the partial of f

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.830
with respect to x evaluated
at a comma b times delta x,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.270
plus the partial of f with
respect to y at the point

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.530
a comma b times delta y.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.780
And now, what we
say is-- and I've

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.260
written this to
accentuate it, because I

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.010
have to talk very
strongly about this.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.960
It's a point that, if I don't
make, most of you, at least,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.680
will allow me to slip over
this and not even notice

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.940
that I've missed something
very, very crucial.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.780
But let me assume that I can
approximate delta w by delta w

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.280
tan.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.850
In other words, let's
suppose that delta w

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.440
tan is a reasonable
approximation for delta w.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.549
You say, well, what's such
a big assumption about that?

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.309
And I'm going to save
that for the very

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.650
last part of the lecture,
because my belief is

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.950
that the subtlety is so great
that I would like to leave that

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.630
for the very end, and go through
as if the subtlety didn't exist

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.430
so that you get the
computational feeling

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.790
as to what's going on here.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:50.660
But here's the
interesting point.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.590
Notice that delta w is a change
in w as you move from the point

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.280
a comma b to some other
point in the plane.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.880
It's a change in height.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.080
Now, obviously,
that change in w is

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.980
going to depend very
strongly on what direction

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.060
you're moving in.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.780
On the other hand, how
was delta w tan computed?

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:17.140
Delta w tan was
computed just by knowing

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.200
two special directional
derivatives known

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.300
as the partial derivatives.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.820
You see, notice
that to get delta w

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.310
tan, I have made the assumption
that all I have to know

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.440
is what's happening
in the x direction

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.240
and what's happening in
the y direction, everything

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.010
else being determined from the
function evaluated at a comma

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:36.750
b.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.720
So this is really a
very strong assumption,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.800
that delta w is determined
pretty closely by delta w tan.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.130
And it turns out to be
almost universally true

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.990
and we're going to save that
part, as I say, for the end.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.110
But for now, let's
suppose that we

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.530
are allowed to replace
delta w by delta w tan.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.550
If we do that, and we go back
to our definition for dw/ds--

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.350
namely, the limit as
delta s approaches 0,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.450
delta w divided by
delta s-- we now

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:14.130
replace delta w by delta w tan
and divide through by delta

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.480
s to find delta w over delta s.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.090
We have, assuming that this
is a legal substitution,

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:27.160
that delta w over delta s is the
partial of f with respect to x,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.450
evaluated at a comma b, times
delta x divided by delta

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.250
s plus the partial of
f with respect to y

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.180
evaluated at a comma b
times the change in y

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.990
divided by the change in s--
delta y divided by delta s.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.450
Now, remember, in the
s direction, x and y

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.330
are not independent variables.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.560
In fact, how are they related?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.960
Let's isolate our
little diagram here so

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.760
that we see in what
direction we're moving here.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.780
We're starting at
the point a comma b.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.860
And by the way, to get
the proper orientation

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.290
here, as I've drawn
the xy-plane here,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.150
imagine the surface coming
out from the blackboard.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.000
In other words, the height
is really being measured away

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.330
from the blackboard here.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.850
That's where my surface is.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.920
I move in the direction of s.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.630
Here is a delta x.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.762
Here is a delta y.

00:11:20.762 --> 00:11:23.740
s has a constant direction,
a constant slope.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.030
It's a straight line.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:28.940
Call the angle that it makes
with the positive x-axis phi.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.950
Notice that no matter how
big delta x and delta y are,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.280
they are related by
similar triangles to what?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.720
The delta x divided by delta
s will always be cosine phi,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.300
and delta y divided by delta
s will always be sine phi.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.890
And therefore, if I replace
delta x divided by delta

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.640
s by cosine phi, delta y
divided by delta s by sine phi,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.050
I obtain that-- what?

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.110
Delta w divided by delta
s is equal to the partial

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.730
of f with respect to x
evaluated at point a comma b

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.460
times the cosine of phi, plus
the partial of f with respect

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:12.060
to y evaluated at a comma
b times the sine of phi,

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.720
where phi is the what?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.444
The angle that the direction s
makes with the positive x-axis.

00:12:18.444 --> 00:12:20.860
At any rate, notice, by the
way, that these things are all

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.710
constants once s is chosen, once
the point a comma b is fixed.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.720
Therefore, when I pass to the
limit, nothing really changes.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.590
In other words,
this thing that I'm

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.610
calling the directional
derivative of f

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.870
in the direction of s
evaluated at a comma b

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.350
turns out to be what?

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.950
The partial of f with respect to
x at the point a comma b times

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.970
cosine phi, plus the partial
of f with respect to y

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.220
evaluated at a comma b
times the sine of phi.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.130
And what I'd like you to notice
is that in these two terms,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.760
one factor of each term
is determined solely

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.750
by the point a comma b.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.580
In other words, notice
that these two factors here

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.880
are just partial
derivatives and have nothing

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.830
to do with direction.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.630
They're determined solely by
the choice of the function

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.340
f and the point a comma b.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.330
On the other hand, notice that
these two factors, cosine phi

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.300
and sine phi, have
nothing to do with f

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.270
and have to do only
with the direction

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.000
s itself, which, again, should
make intuitive sense to you.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.470
That if you're asking,
in terms of the surface

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.560
being up over your head, for
a directional derivative,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.070
obviously, once the
surface is given,

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.460
the directional
derivative should

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.880
depend on two things: one,
what point you start at,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:44.950
and the other, what direction
you move in once you've started

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.340
at that particular point.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.972
And what direction
you move in has

00:13:47.972 --> 00:13:49.680
nothing to do with
what the surface looks

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:51.410
like over your head.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:55.600
At any rate, what we now do
is invoke our dot product

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.990
notation-- in other
words, this little trick

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.420
that we talked about when
we learned dot products.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:06.400
This particular sum can be
written very suggestively

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.070
as the dot product
of two vectors.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.550
Namely, I will
write this as what?

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.710
The vector whose
components are f

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.210
sub x and f sub y dotted with
the vector whose components are

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.080
cosine phi and sine
phi, because remember,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.230
when you dot two vectors
in Cartesian coordinates,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.670
you multiply them
coefficient by coefficient.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.650
To make a long story
short, dw/ds is what?

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.960
It's this vector,
whose i component

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.040
is f sub x evaluated at a
comma b, whose j complement is

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.810
f sub y evaluated at a comma b.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.450
I call that vector
g of a comma b.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.010
I'm going to give that a
special name a little bit later.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.590
But for now, it's very
important to notice

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.460
that this is not a number.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.990
It's an ordered pair of numbers.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.134
In other words, it's
a vector, and if you

00:14:57.134 --> 00:14:59.300
want to think of this as a
vector, what we're saying

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.000
is what?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.790
Think of the vector
whose i component

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.130
is the partial of f with respect
to x evaluated at a comma

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.370
b, whose j complement is f
sub y evaluated at a comma b.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.450
Notice that these are
numbers, because a

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.530
and b are fixed constants here.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:20.210
Therefore, this vector, g of a
comma b, is a constant vector,

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.300
and it's in the xy-plane.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.000
It's a 2-tuple.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.490
On the other hand, the other
vector, (cosine phi, sine phi),

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.830
hopefully, you recognize by now
is nothing more than the unit

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.250
vector in the direction of s.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.760
You see, this is the unit
vector in the direction of s.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.530
So if I now use my abbreviation,
dw/ds evaluated at a comma

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.120
b-- in other words, the
directional derivative of w

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.200
in the direction of s evaluated
at a comma b-- is just

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.580
my vector g of a comma b
dotted with the unit vector

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.110
in the direction of s.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.880
Now, observe have two things.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.920
First of all, when you
dot, this is a constant.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.780
I can't change this
once a and b are given.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.510
This is fixed.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.220
So all I can vary is u sub s.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.950
But u sub s is a unit vector,
so the only way I can vary u

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.240
sub s is to change
its direction.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.010
Notice that for two vectors
of constant magnitude,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.270
their dot product
is maximum when

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.210
the two vectors are parallel.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.610
In other words, this will
be as big as possible

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:32.310
when u sub s is chosen to be in
the direction of my vector g.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.960
In other words,
dw/ds at a comma b

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.810
is maximum in the direction
of g of a comma b.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.600
That's the first
thing to observe.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.690
The second thing is that
when they are parallel,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.200
the cosine of the angle
between them is 1.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.760
So the magnitude of
this vector will just

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.180
be the product of
these two magnitudes.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.730
But the magnitude of u sub s,
u sub s being a unit vector,

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.740
is 1.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.720
Therefore, the maximum
magnitude not only

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.490
occurs in the direction of
g, but it is also numerically

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.220
equal to the magnitude of g.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.660
In other words, the
maximum value of dw/ds

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.140
evaluated at a comma
b not only occurs

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.119
in the direction
of the vector g,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:23.910
but that maximum magnitude is
the magnitude of g evaluated

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:25.400
at a comma b.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.600
For that reason, g of a comma b
is given a very important name.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.790
And I decided to hold off on the
name until as late as possible

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.820
so that the name
wouldn't frighten you.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.380
But the name is the
gradient vector.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.280
In other words, the
vector g of a comma b

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.990
is called the gradient
of f at a comma b.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.640
And it's usually written
in this notation.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.250
An upside down delta.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.200
It's called del, usually,
with an arrow over it,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.570
or in boldface
print in the text.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.990
And it's written this
way, and it's read what?

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.750
The gradient of f
evaluated at a comma b.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.060
What is the gradient of
f evaluated at a comma b?

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.660
It's the vector, which
gives you the hint as to how

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.620
to compute the directional
derivative in any direction

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:13.650
that you wish.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.280
Namely, in terms of
the gradient vector,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.420
the directional derivative
of f in the direction of s,

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.410
evaluated at a,
b, is the gradient

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:28.260
of f evaluated at a comma b
dotted with the unit vector

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.520
in the direction of s.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.830
By the way, you may
recall that when

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.180
you dot a vector
with a unit vector,

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.310
you get the projection of
that vector in the direction

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.420
of the unit vector.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.990
In other words, the directional
derivative-- another way

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.960
of looking at this
physically is nothing more

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.840
than the projection
of the gradient vector

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.700
onto the given direction
in which you're moving.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.390
And the important point is
that this particular definition

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.570
does not depend on
our coordinate system.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.380
What is interesting is that,
in Cartesian coordinates,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.970
there is a very simple way of
computing the gradient vector.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.030
Namely, the i component
of the gradient vector

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.900
is just the partial
of f with respect

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.010
to x and the j component
is just the partial

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.700
of f with respect to y.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.840
But that was a very special
case, because, you see,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.430
i and x happen to have the
same direction, as do y and j.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.450
For arbitrary coordinate
systems, this need not be true.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.032
And I'm going to drill you
on that in the exercises.

00:19:33.032 --> 00:19:34.490
But in other words,
what I'm saying

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.640
is remember the
gradient vector in terms

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.890
of a maximum
directional derivative.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.310
Don't memorize it as a
formula, because if you do,

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.700
you're going to get in trouble.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.830
For example, if I were
to give my surface

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.060
in polar coordinates, say w of
some function of r and theta,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.060
then it turns out--
and there's an exercise

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.750
on this in the notes--
that the gradient of f

00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:01.550
is the partial of w with respect
to r times u sub r plus--

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.440
and here's the
big difference-- 1

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.040
over r times the partial of
w with respect to theta times

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.140
u sub theta.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.020
In other words,
the gradient vector

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:14.580
is not the partial of w
with respect to r times

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:18.870
u sub r plus the partial of
w with respect to theta times

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:19.580
u sub theta.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.660
In other words, you don't just
mechanically differentiate

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.230
with respect to these variables.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.500
And the key reason that you
can't do this-- well, lookit.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.290
Let's just look at
this little diagram.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.830
And I think the whole idea
will become very clear.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.000
Remember that in
polar coordinates

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.280
r is denoted this way.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.730
u sub theta is at
right angles to r.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.920
Notice that u sub theta is
not in the direction of theta.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:46.920
Notice that the
direction of theta

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.390
is sort of the tangent
to this circle of radius

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.750
r at this point.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.580
If I call this
increment d theta,

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.062
notice that this
arc length is r d

00:20:57.062 --> 00:21:00.250
theta, so the vector in the
direction of u sub theta

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.480
is r d theta, not d theta.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.890
I don't know if you noticed
that, but coming back up

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.240
here for a moment, notice
that this was OK here,

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.190
because r was in the same
direction as u sub r.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:18.010
Notice, however, that it's r
d theta which is in the u sub

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.770
theta direction.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:22.630
Again, I leave most of
these details for the notes.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.460
But I feel that if I don't
say these things to you,

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.430
it becomes very easy to
miss these points when

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.660
we talk about them
or write about them,

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.530
but somehow I hope that by
you hearing me say this,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.390
you will be keyed
in when you come

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.460
to these concepts in the
unit that we're studying.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.230
But I think the best way
to augment what we're doing

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.100
is by means of a
specific example.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.890
Let us suppose that we're given
the surface w equals f of x, y,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.250
where f of x, y is x to
the fifth plus x cubed y

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.870
plus y to the fifth.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.290
And we want to compute
the directional derivative

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.540
of f at the point 1 comma
1 in the direction--

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.940
let's call it s sub 1, where
s sub 1 is the direction that

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.212
goes from the point 1 comma
1 to the point 4 comma 5.

00:22:11.212 --> 00:22:13.170
Now, what we're saying
is-- and I guess, maybe,

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.570
if we look at these two
diagrams concurrently,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.180
maybe this'll be easier to see.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.600
Here we are at the
point 1 comma 1.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.650
We want to see how fast the
slope over our head-- the w

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.160
value-- is changing in the
direction of s_1, where

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.950
s_1 is chosen to be what?

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.540
We're moving from
the point 1 comma 1

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.290
in the xy-plane to
the point 4 comma 5.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.100
See, we're moving
in this direction

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.450
and we want to see how fast w is
changing over our heads, which

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.120
geometrically means
you draw this plane,

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.840
intersect it with the
particular surface here.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.090
And this point, P_0-- what
we really want geometrically

00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.780
is what?

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.030
The slope of the line
tangent to this curve

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:08.440
in the w, s_1 plane tangent to
this curve at the point P_0.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.420
And my claim is that this
can be done very, very

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.870
easy from a mechanical
point of view

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.540
now that we have our
gradient vector behind us.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.570
Namely, what we
do is, given what

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:25.430
w looks like as a function of x
and y, we take the partial of w

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.600
with respect to both x
and y, which, hopefully,

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.620
you can all do quite
mechanically now

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.570
based on our last unit's work.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.360
We differentiate, first
holding y constant,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.310
then holding x constant.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.060
At any rate, we obtain what?

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.800
That the partial of
w with respect to x

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.290
is 5 x to the fourth
plus 3 x squared y.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.880
And so if we compute
that at the point 1

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.210
comma 1, when x
and y are both 1,

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.830
this simply turns out to be 8.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.840
In a similar way, the partial
of w with respect to y

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.710
is x cubed plus
6 y to the fifth.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.810
So if we compute that
at the point 1 comma 1,

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.710
that turns out to be 7.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.610
In other words,
then, by definition

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:10.900
of our gradient, which is
the partial of f with respect

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.200
to x evaluated at
1 comma 1 times i,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.420
plus the partial
of f with respect

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.580
to y evaluated at
1 comma 1 times j,

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:24.640
the gradient of f at 1
comma 1 is just 8i plus 7j.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.875
Very easy to write down
mechanically when you're

00:24:26.875 --> 00:24:28.650
using Cartesian coordinates.

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:32.510
Now, let me make a brief
aside, an interruption here.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:36.600
The idea is to emphasize what
the gradient vector means.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.030
What this tells me is that if
I were to leave the point 1

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:46.820
comma 1 in the direction
of the vector 8i plus 4j--

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.710
if I were to leave
in that direction,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.230
that would be the
direction in which

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.610
the directional derivative
would be maximum.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.900
And moreover, that maximum
directional derivative

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.260
would just be the magnitude
of this gradient vector.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.510
The magnitude of
that gradient vector

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.870
is just the square root of 8
squared plus 7 squared, which

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:09.020
is the square root of 113.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.970
In other words,
what this tells us

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:14.550
is that the maximum directional
derivative, leaving the point 1

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.900
comma 1, is the
square root of 113,

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.630
and it occurs in a
direction 8i plus 7j

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.890
as you leave the
point 1 comma 1.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:25.770
At any rate, getting
back to the main stream

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.250
of the problem, what we want
is a directional derivative

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.950
in the direction of s_1.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.810
That means what?

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.140
We take our gradient
vector, which is 8 comma 7m

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.860
and dot that with the unit
vector in the direction of s_1.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.430
You may recall from
this diagram here

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.320
that the vector in
the direction of s_1

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.940
has its i component equal to
3, its j complement equal to 4.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.980
This makes this a 3,
4, 5 right triangle.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.270
So the unit vector
in this direction

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.610
has as its components
3/5 and 4/5.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:04.200
In other words, the directional
derivative of f at the point 1

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.960
comma 1 in the given direction
s_1 is just the gradient dotted

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.170
with the unit vector
3/5*i plus 4/5*j.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.810
Just mechanically carrying
out this operation

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.210
leads to 52 over 5.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:23.160
And by the way, this
had better turn out

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:29.430
to be less than this,
because this is what?

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.740
The maximum value that
the directional derivative

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.270
can have.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.850
In other words, if we
haven't made a mistake here,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.390
one of the checkpoints is what?

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.450
That the vector can't
project to be any longer

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:43.920
than what it really is in this.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.630
It can't be more than
the gradient vector.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.860
But at any rate, let's
now conclude the lecture

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.750
by coming to the part
which is probably

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.260
the hardest thing that
we're going to encounter

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.220
in the whole course.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.190
In a way, I feel a
little bit like a man

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.890
who fell off the
Empire State Building.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.740
And when he went
past the 40th floor,

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.198
somebody said, "How
are you doing?"

00:27:05.198 --> 00:27:06.650
And he said, "So far so good."

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:10.010
And that is, we've taken some
tremendous liberties here.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.110
And the biggest liberty
that we've taken--

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.680
and it's not just a liberty.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.660
It's the kind of a
liberty that to solve

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.430
involves the foundations
of our entire course.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.050
We are now at the
grassroots of what

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.990
at least the calculus of
functions of several variables

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:27.000
is all about.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.240
And that's this trouble spot.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.110
First of all, does
delta w tan exist?

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.690
That's the first question.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.210
Namely, how do you know that
there is a tangent plane?

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.640
Just because the surface
happens to be smooth

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.730
when you cut it by a plane
parallel to the wy-plane

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.910
and smooth when you cut it by a
plane parallel to the wx-plane,

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.076
how do you that it's going to be
smooth for any given direction?

00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:52.140
See, that's the first
intellectual question

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.270
that comes up in the
reading assignment that

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.060
has to be solved effectively.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.150
First of all, does delta
w tan exist meaningfully?

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.700
And secondly, if it does exist,
how is it related to delta w?

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.970
And now, we come to that key
theorem, the proof of which

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.200
is quite hairy.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.200
It's done in the text.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.700
It's also done as
an optional exercise

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.400
to help you generalize
what's done in the text.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.510
And it's the counterpart
of what happens

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.250
with differentials in functions
of a single real variable.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.300
But the key theorem, which
I'll state here without proof,

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.710
is simply this.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.710
Suppose that w is a
function of x and y

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:36.180
and that f sub x and
f sub y both happen

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.901
to exist in some neighborhood
of the point a comma b.

00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:40.400
All right?

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.960
So far so good.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.360
Now, here is they key
additional hypothesis.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.570
Suppose also that f sub
x and f sub y happen

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:52.630
to be continuous at a comma b.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:55.660
My claim is that if this
additional hypothesis is

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.620
obeyed, the tangent
plane will exist.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.940
In other words, it's not enough
for the directional derivative

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.380
to exist in the x
and y directions

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.000
in order to guarantee that the
directional derivative will

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.650
exist in every direction.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.340
But it is enough provided that
these directional derivatives

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.150
happen to be continuous.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.020
And by the way, if these
conditions are met,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:21.760
we say that f is a continuously
differentiable function

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.790
of x and y.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.180
But I'll talk about that more
next time, or in the notes,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.940
or in the exercises.

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.550
We're going to make a big issue
over this sooner or later.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.310
But for now what I
do want to do is just

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.670
end with what the
key theorem is.

00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:37.680
The key theorem says, lookit.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.020
Just like with one variable,
if these conditions are met,

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.590
then there is a very
reasonable approximation

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:47.160
to delta w by delta w tan.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.920
Namely, what the theorem
says is, in this case,

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:53.300
delta w will be the
partial of f with respect

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.170
to x evaluated at a
comma b times delta x

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.390
plus the partial of
f with respect to y

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.100
evaluated at a comma b
times delta y-- and notice,

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.940
of course, that this is a thing
that we've been calling delta y

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:10.880
tan-- plus an arrow.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.680
And the arrow has the form
k_1 delta x plus k_2 delta y,

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.900
where k_1 and k_2 both approach
0 as delta x and delta y

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.930
approach 0.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.090
And this is very, very crucial.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.910
It's not enough, as
we're going to see

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:29.570
in the very next lecture, that
delta x and delta y approach 0.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:34.680
It's that these things go to 0
as delta x and delta y go to 0.

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.620
Consequently, these
terms go to 0 faster.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.030
They go to 0 as a
second-order infinitesimal.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.400
And what this really
says is, look,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.660
for very small values of delta
x and delta y, even when you're

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.310
dealing with 0 over 9 forms,
if you pick a sufficiently

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.550
small neighborhood of
the point a comma b--

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.400
and that's the key point, a
sufficiently small neighborhood

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.590
of the point a comma
b-- then delta w

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:06.510
is approximately
equal to delta w tan

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.920
And by the way, this holds
also in several variables.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:16.070
In other words, I picked the
case n equals 2 here simply

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.660
so that we can
utilize the geometry.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.510
Namely, what we're saying
is, in terms of the geometry,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.800
if f happens to be a
continuously differentiable

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.800
function of x and y, and
we look at the surface w

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:34.650
equals f of x, y above the point
a comma b, what we're saying

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:38.100
is that in a neighborhood
of that point,

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.710
there is-- well, first
of all we're saying what?

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:45.300
A tangent plane exists to
the surface above that point

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.400
and that in a neighborhood
of that point of tangency,

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.990
the tangent plane is an
excellent approximation

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.810
for the true change in w.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.450
Now, what happens is,
if n is greater than 2,

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:01.890
we can no longer use the
geometric interpretation.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.130
But what is important is
that the analytic proof never

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.610
makes use of the picture.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:08.300
And the key point
is-- and I'm going

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.320
to exploit this in
future lectures.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:15.720
The really key point is that the
delta w tan never gets messy,

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.300
that the variables--
delta x, delta y,

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.880
et cetera-- all occur
as linear terms.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.830
And this is why the so-called
linear algebra subject

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:29.500
becomes so important in
the study of functions

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.900
of several variables.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.160
At any rate, I think this
is enough for one lesson.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.800
And in our next
lesson, what we will do

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.980
is show how using
this key theorem

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.340
has its analog in something
called the chain rule,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.290
just as it did in
the case of part one

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:49.730
when we studied functions of
a single independent variable.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.070
At any rate, then,
until next time.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.600
Good bye.
