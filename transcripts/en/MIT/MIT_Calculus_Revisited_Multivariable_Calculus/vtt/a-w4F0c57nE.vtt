00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.549
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.590
In today's lesson,
hopefully we will

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.760
begin to reap the
rewards of our digression

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.180
into the subject
of linear algebra.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.560
Recall that in the
last few lectures, what

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.210
we have been dealing with is
the problem of inverting systems

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.130
of linear equations.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.160
And what we would
like to do today

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.690
is to tackle the
more general problem

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.010
of inverting systems
of equations,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.510
even if the equations
are not linear.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.240
And with this in
mind, I simply entitle

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.290
today's lesson "Inverting More
General Systems of Equations."

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.700
And by way of a
very brief review,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.730
recall that given the linear
system y_1 equals a_(1,1)*x_1

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.940
plus, et cetera, a_(1,n)*x_n; up
to y_n equals a_(n,1)*x_1 plus,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.100
et cetera, a_(n,n)*x_n.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.910
We saw that that system was
invertible, meaning what?

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.890
That we could solve
this system for the x's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760
as linear combinations
of the y's if

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.960
and only if the inverse of
the matrix of coefficients

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200
of this system exists.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.620
And in terms of determinants,
recall that that means if

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.270
and only if the determinant
of the matrix of coefficients

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.420
is not 0.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.170
If the determinant of the matrix
of coefficients was 0, then

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.040
we saw that y_1 up to
y_n are not independent.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.530
In fact, in that
context, that's where

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.870
we came to grips with the
concept of a constraint,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.979
that the constraint actually
turned out to be what?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.780
The fact that the y's
were not independent.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.550
Meaning that we could express
a linear combination of the y's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.180
equal to 0.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.800
So what situation
were we at then?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.460
Given a linear system, if
the matrix of coefficients

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.050
does not have its
determinant equal to 0,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.020
the system is invertible.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.360
We can solve for the
x's in terms of the y's.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.620
If the determinant of the
matrix of coefficients is 0's,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.950
the y's are not
linearly independent.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.840
In other words, the
system is not invertible.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.780
And now what we
would like to do is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.290
to tackle the more general
problem of inverting

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.180
any system of equations.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.690
And by any, I mean what?

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.470
Now we have y_1 is f
sub 1 of x_1 up to x_n,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.440
et cetera, y sub n is f
sub n of x_1 up to x_n.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.440
And now what we're
saying is, we do not

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.870
know whether the f's
are linear or not.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.030
In fact, if they
are linear, we're

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.330
back to, as a special case,
what we've tackled before.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.620
But now we're assuming that
these need not be linear.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.750
And what we would like
to do is to invert

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.220
this system, assuming, of
course, that such an inversion

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.700
is possible.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.160
Again, what do we
mean by the inversion?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.740
We mean, somehow, we
would like to know that

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.140
given this system of n
equations and n unknowns,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.480
where the y's are expressed
explicitly in terms of the x's,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.630
can we invert this,
and express the x's

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.070
in terms of the y's, either
explicitly or implicitly?

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.080
That's the problem that
we'd like to tackle.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.770
And what we're going
to use to tackle this

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.740
is our old friend,
the differential,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.960
the linear approximation,
again, that

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.270
motivated our whole
study of linear systems

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.410
in the first place.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.030
Remember, we already
know that if y_1

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.880
is a differentiable
function of x_1 up to x_n,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.410
that delta y_1
sub tan is exactly

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.620
equal to the partial of f_1
with respect to x_1 times

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.620
delta x_1 plus, et cetera, the
partial of f_1 with respect

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.010
to x_n times delta x_n.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.290
And in terms of reviewing
the notation, because we will

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.380
use it later in
the lecture, notice

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.790
that delta y_1 tan was what
we abbreviated to be dy_1

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.910
And that delta x_1
up to delta x_n

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.970
are abbreviated respectively
as dx_1 up to dx_n.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.500
Generalization of what we
did for the differential

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.580
in the case of one
independent variable and we

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.060
went through this
discussion when

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.779
we talked about exact
differentials in block three.

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.570
And in this similar
way, we could of course

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.450
express delta y_2
tan, et cetera,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.890
and we can talk about the
linear approximations.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.670
All right?

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.850
Not the true delta y's now, but
the linear part of the delta

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.340
y's, the delta y_1 sub
tan, or if you prefer,

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.570
delta y_1 sub lin,
L-I-N. All right?

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.960
And the key point now is what?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.740
If the y's happen to be
continuously differentiable

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.160
functions of the x's in a
neighborhood of the point

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.040
x bar equals a bar-- in
other words, x_1 up to x_n

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.460
is equal to a_1
comma, et cetera,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.190
up to a_n-- x_1 equals
a_1, x_2 equals a_2,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.290
et cetera-- then near that
point, what we're saying

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.800
is what?

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.840
That the error term
goes to 0 very rapidly.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.240
And as long as the functions
are continuously differentiable,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.950
it means what?

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.640
That the change in
y is approximately

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.710
equal to the change
in y sub tan.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.780
So that what we're
saying is-- and remember

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.640
this is what motivated
our linear systems

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.010
in the first place-- that
delta y_1 is approximately

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.760
the partial of y_1
with respect to x_1,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.750
evaluated when x bar is a bar,
times delta x_1 plus et cetera,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.940
the partial of y_1 with
respect to x_n, also evaluated

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.600
when x bar equals a bar,
times delta x sub n et cetera,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.240
down to delta y sub
n is approximately

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.380
equal to the partial of y sub
n with respect to x_1 times

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.410
delta x_1, plus et cetera, the
partial of y sub n with respect

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.320
to x sub n times delta x_n,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.120
where all of these partials
are evaluated specifically

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.950
at the point x bar equals a bar.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.450
The point being what?

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.830
That since we're evaluating
all these partials

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.860
at a particular point, every
one of these coefficients

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.080
is a constant.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.390
You see in general, these
partial derivatives are

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.250
functions, but as soon as we
evaluate them at a given value,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.450
they become specific numbers.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.050
So this is now what?

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.540
On the right-hand side,
we have a linear system,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.650
and the point is that we are
using the fundamental result

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.850
that we can use the linear
approximation as being

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.330
very nearly equal to
the true change in y.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.490
And it's in that
sense that we have

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.060
derived our system of n linear
equations and n unknowns.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.370
You see, this is
a linear system.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.540
The approximation-- again,
let me emphasize that,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.706
because it's very important.

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:17.790
The approximation
hinges on the fact

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.740
that what this is
exactly equal to

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.880
would be delta y_1 tan
et cetera, delta y sub n.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.610
But we're assuming
that these are

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.440
close enough in a small
enough neighborhood of x

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.340
bar equals a bar, so that we can
make this particular statement.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.140
So this is a linear system.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.620
And because it is
a linear system,

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.510
we're back to our special case
that this system is invertible

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.220
if and only if the determinant
of the coefficients-- matrix

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.410
coefficients-- is not 0.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.580
And what is that
matrix coefficient?

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.050
It consists of n
rows and n columns,

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.610
and the row is determined
by the subscript on the y,

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.380
and the column is determined
by the subscript on the x.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.660
So we write that matrix
as the partial of y

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.640
sub i with respect to x sub j.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.470
In other words, the i-th
row involves the y's

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.790
and the j-th column the x.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.480
All right?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.410
And that's exactly, then, how we
handle this particular system.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:18.910
OK?

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.040
Quite mechanically.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.800
And let's just summarize
that, then, very quickly.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.200
If f sub 1 et cetera and
f sub n are continuously

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.220
differentiable functions
of x_1 up to x_n near x bar

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.809
equals a bar, then the
system y_1 equals f_1 of x_1

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:38.820
up to x_n et cetera, y_n
equals f sub n of x_1 up

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.510
to x_n-- that system is
invertible if and only

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:48.240
if the determinant--
the n by n determinant

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.930
whose entry in i-th row, j-th
column is the partial of y

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.350
sub i with respect
to x sub j-- if

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.160
and only if that
determinant is not 0.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.440
Now what does that mean, to
say that it's invertible?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.060
It means that we can solve for
the x's in terms of the y's.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.050
Now we may not be able
to do that explicitly.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.110
The best we may be able to
do is to do that implicitly,

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.680
meaning this.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.096
Let me just come
back to something

00:09:13.096 --> 00:09:14.830
I said before to make
sure that there's

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.630
no misunderstanding about this.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.170
What we're saying is, that in
this particular linear system

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.390
of equations, as long as this
determinant of coefficients is

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:29.280
not 0, we can explicitly solve
for delta x_1 up to delta x_n

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.580
in terms of delta
y_1 up to delta y_n,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.380
even if we may not be
able to solve explicitly

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.770
for the x's in terms of the y's.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.150
In other words,
the crucial point

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.030
is, we can solve
for the changes in x

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.680
in terms of the changes in y.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.850
And that is implicitly enough
to see what the x's look like

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.890
in terms of the y's.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:51.290
Once we know what
the change of x

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.600
looks like in terms
of the change in y,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.420
then we really
know what x itself

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.300
looks like in terms
of the y's, even

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.430
as I say it may be implicitly
rather than explicitly.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.530
At any rate, this
matrix is so important

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.400
that it's given a
very special name.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.840
Definition: The
matrix whose entry

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.750
in the i-th row, j-th
column is the partial

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.160
of y sub i with respect to x
sub j is called the Jacobian.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.320
I put "matrix" in
quotation marks

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.170
here, because some people
refer to the Jacobian

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.300
meaning a matrix.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.710
Other people call the Jacobian
the determinant of the Jacobian

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.210
matrix.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.370
I'm not going to make
any distinction this way.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.070
It'll be clear from context.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.450
Usually when I say
the "Jacobian,"

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.930
I will mean the Jacobian matrix.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.860
I might sometimes mean
the Jacobian determinant.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.790
And so to avoid ambiguity,
I will hopefully

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.420
say "Jacobian matrix"
when I mean the matrix,

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.610
and "Jacobian determinant"
when I mean the determinant.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.600
But should I forget to
do this, or should you

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.830
read a textbook where
the word Jacobian is

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.460
used without the
proper noun after it,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.140
it should be clear from
context which is meant.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.780
But at any rate, that's what
we mean by the Jacobian of y_1

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.480
up to y_n with respect
to x_1 up to x_n.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.600
And this Jacobian matrix is
often abbreviated by-- you

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600
either write J for
Jacobian of y_1

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.930
up to y_n over x_1 up to x_n.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.220
Or else you use a modification
of the partial derivative

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.250
notation.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.560
And you sort of read this as
if it said the partial of y_1

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.500
up to y_n divided by the
partial of x_1 up to x_n.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:39.620
And again, there
is the same analogy

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.810
between why this
notation was invented

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:47.050
and why the notation dy
divided by dx was invented.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:51.470
But in terms of giving you a
general overview of what we're

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.640
interested in, I
think I would like

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.000
to leave the
discussion of why we

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.160
write this in a fractional
form to the homework.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.910
In other words, as either a
supplement to the learning

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.420
exercises or else as part of
the supplementary notes in one

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.430
form or another,
we will take care

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.300
of all of the computational
aspects of how

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.550
one handles the Jacobian.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.560
But what I wanted to
do now was to emphasize

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.750
how one uses the Jacobian matrix
and differentials to invert

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.810
systems of n equations
in n unknowns.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.000
And I will use the
technique that's

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.720
used right in the
textbook, and which

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.630
is part of the assignment
for today's unit.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.610
The example that
I have in mind--

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.410
I simply picked the
usual case, n equals 2,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.710
so that things don't
get that messy.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.640
Using again, the
standard notation

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.050
when one deals with two
independent variables,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.770
let u equal x squared
minus y squared.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.450
Let v equal to 2x*y.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.140
Let's suppose now
that I would like

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.980
to find the partial
of x with respect

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.180
for u, treating v as the
other independent variable.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.250
You see, again, I want
to review this thing.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.790
When I say find the
partial of x with respect

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.530
to u holding v
constant, it is not

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.270
the same as finding
the partial of u

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.710
with respect to x from here
and then just inverting it.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.320
Namely the partial of u
with respect to x here

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.820
assumes that y is
being held constant.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.320
And if you then invert that,
recall that what you're finding

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.090
is the partial of x with
respect to u treating y

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.230
as the other variable.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.140
We want the partial
of x with respect

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.970
to u treating u and v as the
pair of independent variables.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.580
Why?

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.160
Because that's exactly what you
mean by inverting this system.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.530
This system as given
expresses u and v

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.740
in terms of the pair of
independent variables x and y.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.990
And now what you'd like to do
is express the pair of variables

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.540
x and y in terms of the
independent variables u and v,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.200
assuming of course,
that u and v are indeed

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.790
independent variables.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.140
The mechanical solution
is simply this.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.580
Using the language
of differentials,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.350
we write down du and dv.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.060
Namely, du is what?

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.110
The partial of u with
respect to x times dx,

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.420
plus the partial of u with
respect to y times dy.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.670
And from the relationship that
u equals x squared minus y

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.690
squared, we see that du
is 2x*dx minus 2y*dy.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:23.290
Similarly, since the partial
of v with respect to x is 2y,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.500
and the partial of v
with respect to y is 2x,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.300
we see that dv is
2y*dx plus 2x*dy.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.700
If we now assume that
this is evaluated

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.840
at some point (x_0, y_0),
what do we have over here?

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.620
Once we've picked out
a point (x_0, y_0)

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.700
to evaluate this at-- and I
left out that because it simply

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.620
would make the
notation too long,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.500
but I'll talk about
that more later.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.430
Assuming that we've evaluated
this at a particular fixed

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.090
value of x and y, we have what?

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.836
du is some constant times dx
plus some constant times dy.

00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:03.960
dv is some constant times dx
plus some constant times dy.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.670
In other words, du
and dv are expressed

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.410
as linear combinations
of dx and dy.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.530
We know how to invert
this type of a system,

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.060
assuming that it's invertible.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.270
Sparing you the details,
what I'm saying is what?

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.390
I could multiply,
say, the top equation

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.140
by x, the bottom equation by y.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.100
And when I add them, the terms
involving dy will drop out.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.950
And I will get x*du plus
y*dv is 2x*dx plus 2y*dx.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.460
In other words twice--
it's 2 x squared.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.240
I multiply the top equation by
x, the bottom equation by y.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.620
So the right-hand
side here becomes

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.360
2 x squared dx plus 2 y
squared dx, which is twice

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.490
x squared plus y squared dx.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.840
I now divide both
sides of the equation

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.780
through by twice x
squared plus y squared.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.670
I wind up with the
fact that dx is

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:01.270
x over twice the quantity x
squared plus y squared du,

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:06.510
plus the quantity y over twice
x squared plus y squared dv.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.010
Recall that I also
know by definition

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.700
that dx is the partial
of x with respect

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.960
to u times du plus the partial
of x with respect to v times

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.990
dv, recalling from our
lecture on exact differentials

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.370
that the only way two
differentials in terms

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.460
of the du and dv can be
equal is if they're equal

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.610
coefficient by coefficient.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.970
I can therefore equate
the two coefficients of du

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.020
to conclude that the partial
of x with respect to u

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:39.670
is x over 2 times the quantity
x squared plus y squared.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.120
In fact, I can get the
extra piece of information,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.730
even though I wasn't asked
for that in this problem,

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.110
that the partial of
x with respect to v

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.240
is y over twice the quantity
x squared plus y squared.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.860
By the way, observe,
purely algebraically,

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.310
that the only time I
would be in any difficulty

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.490
with this procedure is if
x squared plus y squared

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.650
happened to equal 0.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.230
In other words, if x squared
plus y squared happened

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.470
to equal 0, then to
divide through by twice

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.740
x squared plus y squared is
equivalent to dividing through

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.750
by 0.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.730
And division by 0
is not permissible.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.609
In other words,
somehow or other,

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:22.069
I must take into consideration
that I am in trouble if x

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.030
squared plus y squared is 0.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.079
Notice, by the way,
that the only time

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.580
that x squared plus
y squared can be 0

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.800
is if both x and y are 0.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.530
And that means, again,
that somehow or other,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:39.460
at the point 0 comma 0-- in
a neighborhood of the point 0

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.020
comma 0, in the
neighborhood of the origin,

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.170
I can expect to have a
little bit of trouble.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.860
Now again, the main
aim of the lecture

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.720
is to give you an overview.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.640
The trouble that
comes in at the origin

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.410
will again be left
for the exercises.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.050
In a learning exercise, we will
discuss just what goes wrong

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.730
if you take a neighborhood
of the origin,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.890
to discuss the change of
variables u equals x squared

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:07.490
minus y squared, v equals 2x*y.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.920
Suffice it to say,
for the time being,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.410
that the system of equations
u equals x squared minus y

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.330
squared, v equals 2x*y is
invertible in any neighborhood

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.630
of a point x_0 comma y_0 except
in that one possible case when

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.575
you have chosen as the
point (x_0, y_0) the origin.

00:18:27.575 --> 00:18:30.770
At any rate, to take
this problem away

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.790
from the specific
concrete example

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.820
that we've been talking
about, and to put

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.570
this in terms of a more
general perspective,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.770
let's go back more abstractly
to the more general system.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.530
Let's suppose now
that u and v are

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.350
any two continuously
differentiable functions

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.440
of x and y.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.260
Let u be f of x, y.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.560
Let v equal to g of x, y.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.620
And what we're saying
is, if you pick

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.380
a particular point x_0 comma
y_0, then by mechanically

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.760
using the total
differential, we have

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.950
that du is the partial
of f with respect

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.660
to x evaluated at (x_0, y_0)
times dx, plus the partial of f

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.010
with respect to y, evaluated
at (x_0, y_0) times dy.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.100
We have that dv is the
partial of g with respect

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.310
to x evaluated at
(x_0, y_0) times dx

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.860
plus the partial
of g with respect

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.580
to y, evaluated at
(x_0, y_0) times dy.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.000
What is this now?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.560
This is a linear system of
two equations in two unknowns.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.180
du and dv are linear
combinations of the dx and dy.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.160
The key point being again--
that's why I put this in here

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.840
specifically, with the
x sub 0 and the y sub

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.280
0-- the key point
is that as soon

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.450
as you evaluate a partial
derivative at a fixed point,

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:52.720
the value is a constant,
not a variable.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.030
So this is what?

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:55.830
A linear system.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.116
We have du as a constant times
the x plus a constant times dy.

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:03.690
dv is a constant times dx
plus a constant times dy.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.610
Again, to make a
long story short,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.240
I can solve for dx in
terms of du and dv.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.680
I can solve for dy in terms
of du and dv, provided what?

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.070
That my matrix of
coefficients does not

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.110
have its determinant equal to 0.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:22.150
And to review this
more explicitly

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.430
so you see the mechanics, all
I'm saying is, to solve for dx,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.420
I can multiply the top
equation by the partial

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.630
of g with respect to y
evaluated at (x_0, y_0).

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:39.050
I can multiply the bottom
equation by minus the partial

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.440
of f with respect to y
evaluated at (x_0, y_0).

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.780
And then when I add
these two equations,

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.860
the dy term will drop out.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.450
Again, leaving the
details for you,

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.930
it turns out that dx is what?

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.039
The partial of g
with respect to y--

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:56.080
and I've abbreviated this
again, this means what?

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.100
Evaluated at (x_0, y_0).

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.500
Times du minus the partial of f
with respect to y at (x_0, y_0)

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.880
times dv over the
partial of f with respect

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.300
to x times the partial
with g with respect

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.050
to y minus the partial
of f with respect to y

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.770
times the partial of
g with respect to x.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:21.390
And notice, of course, that
this denominator is precisely

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:23.860
our matrix of coefficients.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.640
f sub x, f sub y;
g sub x, g sub y.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.910
And the only place I've
taken a liberty here

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.110
is to use the abbreviation of
leaving out the (x_0, y_0).

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.630
And the key point is what?

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.460
The only place I am
going to get in trouble

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.260
is if this denominator
happens to be 0.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.880
In the two by two
case-- in other words,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.240
in the case of two
equations and two unknowns,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.380
notice that we
can see explicitly

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.730
what goes wrong when the
determinant of coefficients

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.490
is 0.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.230
The determinant of coefficients
is just this denominator.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.130
And when that denominator
is 0, we're in trouble.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:03.700
In other words, the only time
we cannot invert this system,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.080
the only time we cannot find
delta x and delta y in terms

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.760
of du and dv is when
this determinant is 0.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.020
Now you see, I think this is
pretty straightforward stuff.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.200
The textbook has
a section on this,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.020
as you will be reading shortly.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.430
It is not hard to work
this mechanically.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.150
And then the
question comes up is,

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.610
how come when you pick up a
book on advanced calculus,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.830
there's usually a huge chapter
on Jacobians and inversion?

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.820
Why isn't it this simple
in the advanced textbooks?

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.180
Why can we have it in our
book this simply, but yet,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.370
in the advanced book, why is
there so much more to this

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.880
beneath the surface?

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.300
The answer behind all
of this is quite subtle.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.105
In fact, the major
subtlety is this.

00:22:52.105 --> 00:22:55.280
And that is that
the notation du--

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.165
and for that matter, dv or dx
or dy or dx_1 dx_2, whatever

00:23:00.165 --> 00:23:02.900
you're using here--
is ambiguous.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.170
And it's ambiguous for
the following reason.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:10.450
Recall how we defined the
meaning of the symbol du.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.480
If we're assuming
that u is expressed

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.050
as a function of the independent
variables x and y, then by du,

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.820
we mean delta u tan.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.930
On the other hand,
if we inverted this,

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.750
du now-- in other words, what
do I mean by inverted this?

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:29.460
What I mean, first of
all, is if we assume now

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.330
that x and y are expressed in
terms of u and v-- for example,

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:38.470
suppose x is some function h of
u and v, what does du mean now?

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.870
Notice that now u
is playing the role

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.490
of an independent variable.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:47.080
For the independent variable,
du just means delta u.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.690
In other words, by way
of a very quick review,

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:53.620
notice that if we're viewing u
as being a dependent variable,

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.680
then du means delta u tan.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.510
But if we're viewing u as
being an independent variable,

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.100
then du means delta u.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:08.150
And consequently, the
results that we're using

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.740
hinge very strongly then--
in other words, the inversion

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.210
that we're using hinges very
strongly on the requirement.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:19.470
In other words, the inversion
requires the validity

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.150
of interchanging delta u
and delta u tan, et cetera.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.110
Now let me show you what
that means more explicitly.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.210
Let's come back to something
that we were talking

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.700
about just a few moments ago.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.980
From a completely
mechanical point of view,

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.230
given that u equals f of x,
y and v equals g of x, y,

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:41.520
we very mechanically
wrote down that du

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:48.475
was f sub x dx plus f sub y dy,
dv was g sub x dx plus g sub y

00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:51.870
dy, and then we just
mechanically solved for dx

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.450
in terms of du and dv.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.960
My claim is, is that if we
translate this thing, if we

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.560
translate this thing into the
language of delta u's, delta

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.840
x's, delta u tan's,
delta x tans, et cetera,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.340
what we really said was what?

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.490
That delta u tan was the partial
of f with respect to x times

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.900
delta x, plus the partial of f
with respect to y times delta

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.750
y.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.110
And delta v tan was the partial
of g with respect to x times

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.540
delta x, plus the partial of g
with respect to y times delta

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.520
y.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.170
And then when we
eliminated delta y

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.730
by multiplying the
top equation by g sub

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.780
y and the bottom
equation by minus f sub y

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:38.200
and adding, what we found
was how to express delta x--

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.080
and catch this, this
is the key point--

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.260
what we did was we
expressed delta x

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.730
as a linear combination--
not of delta u and delta v,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.990
but of delta u tan
and delta v tan.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.670
You see, notice that the
result that we needed

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:00.250
to have to be able
to use differentials

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.580
was not this, but this.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.880
See, we found this,
not delta x tan

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:12.580
equals g_y delta u minus f sub
y delta v over f sub x g sub y

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.560
minus f sub y g sub x.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.720
To be able to say-- to invert
this required that this was

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.470
the expression that we
had, yet the expression

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.570
that we were really
evaluating was this one.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.420
In fact, let me come
back for one moment,

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.010
and make sure that we see this.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.570
You see, notice again
that the subtlety

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.560
of going from here to
here and inverting never

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.510
shows us that we've interchanged
the roles of u and v

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.960
from being the
dependent variables

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.050
to the independent variables.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.690
So the reason that
there is so much

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.930
work done in advanced textbooks
under the heading of inverting

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.170
systems of equations
is to justify

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.260
that being able to switch
from delta x to delta x tan

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:03.910
or from delta u tan to delta
u as we see fit, whenever

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.670
it serves our purposes.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.970
The validity of
being able to do that

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.330
hinges on this more
subtle type of proof,

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:13.460
that as far as I'm
concerned, goes

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.040
beyond the scope of our text,
other than for the fact that

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.640
in the learning exercises, I
will find excuses to bring up

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.660
all of the situations
that bring out

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.320
where the theory is important.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.030
In other words, there
will not be proofs

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.240
of these more difficult things.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.950
Not because the proofs
aren't important,

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.366
but from the point
of view of what

00:27:33.366 --> 00:27:35.030
we're trying to
do in our course,

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.890
these proofs tend to obscure
the main stream of things.

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.000
So what I will do in the
learning exercises is bring up

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.880
places that will show you
why the theory is important,

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.520
at which point, I will emphasize
what the result of the theory

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.910
is without belaboring
and beleaguering you

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:55.830
with the proofs of these things.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.680
At any rate, what
I'd like to do now,

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.540
next time, is to give
you an example where

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.850
all of the material, of the
blocks of material that we've

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.760
done now on partial derivatives,
are sort of pulled together

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.810
very nicely.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.090
But at any rate, we'll talk
about that more next time.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.480
And until next time, goodbye.
