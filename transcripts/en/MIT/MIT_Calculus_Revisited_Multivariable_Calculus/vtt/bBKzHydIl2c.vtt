00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.000
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.260
In our lesson
today, we shall try

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.270
to find a relationship
between line

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.600
integrals and double integrals.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.300
In particular, we shall
equate line integrals

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.590
along certain types
of closed curves

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.400
to double integrals
over the region enclosed

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.620
by the particular closed curve.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.280
In particular, the
title of today's lecture

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.350
is Green's theorem.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.330
And in terms of
some particulars,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
I guess the intuitive notion
that we'll have to accept

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.760
is the idea of what one
means by a connected region.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.300
I think this is one of those
times in mathematics where

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.560
we can say, if you have
an intuitive idea of what

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.240
the concept means, you
have the exact idea

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.740
of what the concept means.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.470
Essentially, connected
means that you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920
can get from any
place in the region

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.770
to any other place in
the region without ever

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.860
having to leave the region.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.000
It's as simple as that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.650
OK.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.060
Connected means that you can
get from any point in the region

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.730
to any other point in the
region without ever having

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.810
to go outside the region.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.730
The mathematician distinguishes
between two different types

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.550
of connected regions.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.010
One of which is called
simply connected.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.910
The other of which
being the opposite

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.360
of simply connected,
meaning non-simply

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.780
connected or multiply connected.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.529
I prefer multiply connected
to non-simply connected,

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:55.070
because in non-simply connected
you don't know whether you're

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.340
modifying simply or connected.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.280
A non-simply
connected region, when

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.310
you say multiply connected,
means that in particular

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.240
the region is connected.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.700
The intuitive way of looking at
this is that simply connected

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.015
means no holes.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.620
For example, this region
here is not only connected,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.230
but it's simply connected.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.950
There are no holes.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.630
This region is connected.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.010
You see I can get from any
point to any other point

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.890
without ever having
to leave the region.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.660
But it's called
multiply connected,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.870
because there are
holes in the region.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.650
By the way, you see, the
trouble with using expressions

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.110
like holes versus non-holes, is
that in that particular case,

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.980
where we're dealing with
two or three dimensions

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.350
there's certainly no problem,
because we intuitively

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.580
visualize what a hole is.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.180
In n-dimensional
space-- and we have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.910
analogs of these results in
these n-dimensional space--

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.950
the problem is that how
do you describe a hole

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.080
without referring to a picture?

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.200
And the more rigorous
mathematical definition

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.870
of a simply connected region
is the following: the connected

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.070
region-- and it has to be
connected before you talk

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.320
about simply connected, you
see-- the connected region

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.550
R is called simply connected
if its complement is also

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.520
connected.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.550
Remember the complement
is the portion

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.930
of space left when the
particular region is deleted.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.910
For example, here we have
a simply connected region.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.930
Notice that the
complement of this region

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.930
would be, for example,
the entire blackboard

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.340
with this piece missing.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.530
And the entire blackboard
with this piece missing

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.660
is still a connected region.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.120
On the other hand, if we were
to take this connected region

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.910
and look at its
complement, its complement

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.960
is this little hole together
with what's outside here.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.120
And notice that there
is no way from getting

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.710
from here to here without having
to go outside the complement.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.400
You see, in other
words, the complement

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.640
of the multiply connected
region is not connected.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.700
At any rate, whichever way you
want to look at this, is fine.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.540
Think of simply
connected, at least

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.260
in the two-dimensional
case, as meaning no holes.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.690
And with this as background,
Green's theorem--

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.410
call it the theorem, I
guess-- is stated as follows.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.920
Suppose R is simply connected
with a boundary C. Notice,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.760
R is the region.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.200
C is its boundary.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.110
And a very interesting
thing takes place.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.600
If you form the line integral
around the boundary C,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.660
and by the way, with
this loop in here,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.400
this is the symbol that we
mean around the closed curve.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.430
The arrow head is simply done
to invoke the convention--

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.930
and we do have to
pick a convention,

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.480
just like we did in calculus
of a single variable

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.160
about positive and
negative and how

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.080
you move-- we pick the
positive direction as being

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.900
the direction in which one
goes around the boundary

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.440
so that the region
appears to our left

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.920
as we go around the boundary.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.360
As we're going around here,
you see, in this direction,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.130
the region appears to our left.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.240
At any rate, I'll mention
that in more detail later.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.590
The directed line integral
around closed curve C,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.500
M*dx plus N*dy turns out to be a
double integral over the region

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.100
R enclosed by the curve.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.580
And that double integral
has as its integrand

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.760
the partial of N with respect
to x minus the partial of M

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.240
with respect to y.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.400
And I will refer to this
again very, very shortly.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.400
But I hope that this
rings a familiar bell

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.170
in terms of what we talked
about exact differentials.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.950
Remember, a differential
M*dx plus N*dy was exact

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.300
if the partial of N with respect
to x equaled the partial of M

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.420
with respect to y.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.290
I'll return to that in a moment.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.900
For the time being,
all I want you to see

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.620
is what Green's theorem says.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.010
What Green's theorem does is
it relates a line integral

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.920
along the boundary of a
simply connected region

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.520
to a double integral
over the region itself.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.730
The proof of the theorem
is in the Thomas text.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.700
It's available in a pretty
straightforward form

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.940
for anybody who would like to
see the proof of the result.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.960
I don't think I want to prove
the result in this lecture.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.170
I think I would rather hammer
home what the theorem says,

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.120
rather than what this
rigorous proof is.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.150
The idea is, though, that what?

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.070
A line integral is related
to a multiple integral.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.060
And all that's required
for Green's theorem

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.750
to be true is that M, N, the
partial of M with respect to y,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.690
the partial of N
with respect to x

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.840
must exist and be continuous
in a region containing R.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.160
And we'll see later that
even the condition of simply

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.050
connected can be waived.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.410
In fact, in the
Thomas demonstration,

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.540
we don't even deal with the
most general simply connected

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.430
regions.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.020
He gives his proof for
a very specific type

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.080
of simply connected region.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.210
But again, that
isn't crucial either.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.760
We'll talk about that in more
detail later in the lecture

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.270
as well as in the exercises.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.610
The idea again though is what?

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.930
We're not relating
arbitrary line integrals

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.970
to arbitrary multiple integrals.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.000
But Green's theorem
relates a line integral

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.350
along the boundary of a
simply connected region

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.230
to a double integral
defined on the interior

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.800
of the closed curve
C, the region R.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.552
And there are two
interesting cases.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.760
One of which-- well, there
are more than two, but two

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.120
that we'd like to talk about.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.530
One of the interesting
cases we've already hinted

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.730
at and that is if M*dx
plus N*dy is exact,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.620
then the integral of M*dx plus
N*dy around the closed curve C

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.890
is 0.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.630
And the reason
for this, you see,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.870
is that the integral
around the closed curve,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.050
by Green's theorem, is just
a double integral partial N

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.310
with respect to x minus
partial M with respect to y.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.670
And if M*dx plus N*dy is exact,
then these two terms are equal

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.110
so that their difference
is identically 0.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.660
And to integrate 0*dA over
any region R, of course,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.630
is just 0 itself.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.470
In other words, then, if
M*dx plus N*dy is exact,

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.350
the integral around
any closed curve is 0.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.190
And by the way, this
ties in with a question

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.200
that was raised in
our previous lecture.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.150
And that was we saw that if
we had a force for example,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:38.730
and we had a particle move from
the point P_0 to the point P_1

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.740
under the influence
of that force,

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.860
that the work done as that
particle moved in general

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.000
depended on the curve
which connected P_0 to P_1.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.950
My claim is that if the
force, M*i plus N*j has as its

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.950
components-- see M and N-- where
the partial of M with respect

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.660
to y equals the partial
of N with respect x.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.480
My claim is, under
those conditions,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.530
the work is independent
of the path.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.050
And that's what we mean in turn
by a conservative force field.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.490
The proof is quite simple.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.040
What we do is we pick
two different paths

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.630
that connect P_0 to P_1.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.060
We call one of the paths
C_1 and the other path C_2.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.600
And now, what we're
saying is, if we

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.510
think of C as being
the curve that

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.450
keeps this region to our
left as we go along here,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.890
then the integral around C is 0.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.800
But what is the
integral around C?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.440
It's the integral along C_1
minus the integral along C_2.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.650
And I hope that that's
clear from the exercises

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.780
of last time.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.540
That when you switch the
sense of the path, all you do

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.290
is change the sign
of the integrand.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.540
In fact, by the way, while we're
on that topic, let's digress

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.950
for a moment and return to our
statement of Green's theorem

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.950
and observe that if we were
to switch the convention,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.440
if we want to switch
the convention,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.430
and keep the positive
direction as that which

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.200
kept the area on
our right, notice

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.470
that this would change
the sense here, which

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.130
should give me a minus sign.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.110
But if I interchange, you
see, the order of the terms

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.140
here, if I reverse
the sense, the sign

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.560
of the integral, the double
integral, will also change.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.740
The important point being that
all of these sign conventions

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.700
are preserved by things like
Green's theorem and the like.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.560
But the important point is,
getting back to this now,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.370
the integral around
the closed curve C

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.290
is the integral along C_1
minus the integral along C_2.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.120
And since the integral along
that closed curve is 0,

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.410
it says that this
minus this is 0.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.490
Consequently, these two
integrals are equal.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.150
And since C_1 and
C_2 are arbitrary

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.160
paths that connect
P_0 and P_1, that

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.930
shows that the line integral,
in this particular case,

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.380
does not depend on the path,
but only the points P_0 and P_1.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.400
Again, we will emphasize
that more in the exercises.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.320
The second interesting
application of Green's theorem

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.590
is a form which
not only shows us

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.020
how a line integral and a
multiple integral are related,

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.630
but it actually shows us a way
of computing an area in terms

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.110
of a line integral.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.330
In particular, if
in Green's theorem

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:30.580
we let N equal x and
M equal negative y,

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.630
notice that Green's
theorem then becomes what?

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.070
The integral along
a closed curve C,

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:41.020
M*dx plus N*dy is just
minus y*dx plus x*dy.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.910
The partial of N with
respect to x is 1.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.170
The partial of M with
respect to y is minus 1.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:48.990
Therefore the partial
with N with respect

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.710
to x minus the partial of
M with-- the partial of N

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.590
with respect to x minus the
partial of M with respect to y

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.240
is 1 minus minus 1, which is 2.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.760
In other words,
Green's theorem says

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.470
that the integral around the
closed curve, in this case,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.880
is twice the area of the region
R. You see, without the 2

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.010
in here, this would just be
the area of the region R.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.040
Since 2 is a constant
factor, we can take it

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.650
outside the integral sign.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.550
In other words, in
terms of a picture,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:20.370
if I want to find the
area of the region R,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.030
and I want to use
a line integral,

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.540
I need only take one
half of this integral.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.060
In other words, the area
of the region R is one half

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:37.550
the integral around the
boundary of R, x*dy minus y*dx.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.140
And again, I will drill
on that in the homework.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.610
The one remaining thing
I wanted to point out

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.350
before we go to a
specific example

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.750
is how we remove the
restriction of the region being

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.230
simply connected.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.690
You see, what I claim
is that we may replace

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.330
simply connected by connected.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.050
Since multiply
connected regions are

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.250
unions of simply connected ones
with cuts, whatever that means.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.890
Let me show you what
I'm saying here.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.920
Look at this multiply
connected region here.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.890
What I'm saying is, suppose
I were to cut this region,

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.340
I can then visualize this as the
union of two simply connected

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.000
regions.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.070
In fact, if I have a piece
of paper in my pocket,

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.930
I think we might as well-- the
entire two parts of calculus

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.860
are almost over, and I've never
done an experiment for you.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.580
Here's one I think
even I can handle.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.900
Here's a connected region.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:31.990
It's a piece of paper.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.310
I'll fold it.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.550
And I'll now make it.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.410
It's simply connected, because
there are no holes in it.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.630
I will now undo that.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.670
I will make the region connected
but now multiply connected.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.610
You see, there's a hole in it.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.430
And all I'm saying is,
if I cut this region,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.470
not necessarily along
a straight line.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.220
All I've got to do is to cut it.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.120
If I cut this region,
then what I have

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.130
are two simply
connected regions that

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.680
can be viewed as being
fit together this way.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.969
But to see them clearly,
we can just separate them.

00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:10.760
But the reason I wanted
to cut them for you

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.010
is to see that I can
actually fit these together.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.870
And notice that
the cut that joins

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.270
these two, from a
theoretical point of view,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:19.160
has no thickness.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.660
Right?

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.110
That's just a line
that joins these two.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.100
And here's the key point.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.420
You see physically, certainly if
I put a cut inside the region,

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.825
the resulting picture is
different than with the cut

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:31.325
missing.

00:14:31.325 --> 00:14:34.305
In other words, I can
distinguish between the shape

00:14:34.305 --> 00:14:37.760
that I've drawn without the
accentuated chalk mark in here

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.310
and the shape that I have
with the accentuated chalk

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.470
mark in here.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.760
But here's the key point.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.500
First of all, as far as
computing a double area

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:50.870
is concerned, the cut, having
no thickness, has zero area.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:55.330
So if somehow I were to compute
the area of the region R

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.880
without the cut, I would
expect to get the same area.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.380
Or if I were to
compute whatever you

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.380
want to call this, the
density or what have you,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.220
if I want to compute the mass
of the region R with the cut,

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.140
it should be the same as
the mass without the cut,

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.980
because the difference
is essentially what?

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.651
A set of points
which has zero area.

00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:16.150
And by the way, for
those of you who

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.820
may read ahead in mathematics
and have heard such expressions

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.200
as Lebesgue integrals, the
Lebesgue integral and the like.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.860
These are things defined
on sets of measure 0.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.377
What these things mean from
an intuitive point of view

00:15:29.377 --> 00:15:31.210
is essentially what
we're talking about now.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.420
You see here are infinitely
many points on this cut.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.520
And yet the important thing
is that with respect to area

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.880
these points, even though
they're infinite in number,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.672
contribute no area.

00:15:40.672 --> 00:15:42.171
In other words,
there are infinitely

00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.550
many points on a line, but
a line having no thickness

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.810
has no area.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.890
So certainly, putting
the cut in does not

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.120
affect the double integral.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.180
On the other hand,
since we always

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.930
assumed that the region is kept
on our left as we go around,

00:15:57.930 --> 00:16:01.190
it turns out that from the
single integral, the line

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.670
integral point of
view, each cut cancels

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.050
because of opposite sense.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.480
What I'm saying is, if I take
this region and slice it,

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.400
you see, how do I
traverse this piece?

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.350
Since I want the area to
be enclosed on my left,

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:19.760
I traverse this region in
this particular direction.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.320
When it comes to this piece,
I traverse this region

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.230
in this direction so that the
area is enclosed to my left.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.630
When I now superimpose
these two, what happens

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.560
is, since this line integral
and this line integral

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.870
go exactly over the same curve,
remember I just separated these

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.260
so I could see them better,
when I push these together,

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:42.660
this is the same line.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.160
Since they have the same
function, the same points,

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.500
but only opposite sense,
these two integrals cancel.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.330
In other words, if I'm
given a region that's

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.210
multiply connected, I
can view it like this,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.720
meaning I go around
this piece this way

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.310
so that my region is on my left.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.620
I go around the
outside border this way

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.240
so that the region
is on my left.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.240
And when I want to
use Green's theorem,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.660
all I do is essentially,
I don't even

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.560
have to make the two cuts here,
I could even make one cut.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.380
And look at this
as the union of--

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:23.795
See, well, the two is-- see,
if I make just the one cut

00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:27.470
and leave the line out,
there are no longer any holes

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.462
in the region here.

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:29.920
But that's not the
important point.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.750
The important point is that to
visualize the integral that I

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.510
want, or the regions that
I want, all I have to do

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:36.830
is put the cut in.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.780
And whatever the cut
does is canceled out

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.680
in the statement
of Green's theorem.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:43.990
In other words, again,
that quite often

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.930
in using Green's
theorem, we still

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.440
apply it to multiply
connected regions.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.360
The reason that we
stress simply connected

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.440
is that the proofs that are
given for Green's theorem

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.070
are easiest to handle
in the case of simply

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.240
connected regions.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.870
And then we simply generalize
it to multiply connected

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.050
by pointing out what we just
did here, that we can always

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:08.070
visualize a multiply connected
region as a union of simply

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.170
connected regions if the
appropriate cuts are made.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.000
And again, that will be
emphasized in the exercises.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.330
I thought that what we should
do to finish off today's lesson

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.200
would be to actually
do a trivial exercise.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.290
By trivial, I mean
Green's theorem

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.700
has profound application.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.310
It's more than just
relating line integrals

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.250
to multiple integrals.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.870
The applications of these
things are enormous.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.150
And we're going to hit a few
of these in the exercises.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.600
But what I wanted to do was to
pick sort of a straightforward

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.490
example just to have you see
what Green's theorem means

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.650
when we translate into
a concrete situation.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.430
And the example I have
in mind is simply this.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:53.982
Let's compute the line integral
around the closed curve C,

00:18:53.982 --> 00:18:59.910
y cubed dx plus x to the
fourth dy, where the curve

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:08.370
C happens to be the following
simply closed, or closed curve.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.920
I start at the origin and
move to the point (1, 1)

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.430
along the parabola
y equals x squared.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:21.710
Then I moved from (1, 1) to (0,
1) along the line y equals 1.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.850
And then I move from
(0, 1) down to (0, 0)

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.020
along the line x equals 0.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.630
The boundary of this is what I'm
calling my region C, my curve

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:38.030
C. Notice that the region R
enclosed by C lies on my left

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.420
as I traverse the boundary
of C. And what I want to do

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.160
is to find the value
of this line integral

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.140
along this particular
closed curve C.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.070
And again, if you
want to see this

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.480
in terms of our lecture of
last time, where we talked

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.770
about work and force,
imagine that my force

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:03.020
is defined in the xy-plane,
at any point (x, y),

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.420
to be y cubed i plus x to
the fourth j, et cetera.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:11.410
Meaning dR, as usual,
will be dx*i plus dy*j.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.400
And what we're saying is
that this particular integral

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.580
represents the work that would
be done if a particle were

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:25.510
starting at the point (0, 0) and
being moved along the curve C

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.680
so that it returns
to the point (0, 0).

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.090
Now keep in mind, merely
because the particle

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.240
is returning to the
same point from which it

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.580
started is not enough to
guarantee that the work done is

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.310
0.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.930
In fact, the guarantee
that would be necessary

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.370
would be that the partial
of y cubed with respect to y

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.810
would have to be identical to
the partial of x to the fourth

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.020
with respect x.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.730
And that certainly
isn't the case

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.160
in this particular example.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.390
We don't have a conservative
force field in this case.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.880
In this case, we suspect
that the work done

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.650
should depend on the path
connecting the points.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.460
In particular, if we go
around a closed path,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.140
the work done would
not have to be 0.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.260
At any rate, that's
enough lip service

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.600
paid to the physical
interpretation of this.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.090
Let's actually try to
solve this problem.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.480
And what we're going to do
is solve it in two ways.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.150
The first way will be to
emphasize Green's theorem.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.390
We'll solve it first
by Green's theorem,

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.140
because that is the
sermon for today.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.960
And the second method
will be to show

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.520
how we would have solved
the same problem if we

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.200
didn't have Green's theorem.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.630
The idea being, I won't tell
you which of the two ways

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:36.910
one should have done this.

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.860
The important point
from our point of view

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.610
is that the two methods
yield the same answer.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.130
At any rate, to use
Green's theorem,

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.240
notice that M is y cubed.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.830
N is equal to x to the fourth.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.600
So the statement
of Green's theorem,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.650
which says that the integral
around the closed curve C,

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.960
M*dx plus N*dy is the double
integral around the region

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.340
enclosed by C, the partial
of N with respect to x minus

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.800
the partial of M with
respect to y, dA.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.910
That leads to this.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.620
And now, what is my region A?

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.040
I'll think of it
as being a dy*dx.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.700
And if I look at my
region a, I observe

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:24.170
that for a fixed value of
x, y varies from the curve

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.810
x squared to 1.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.340
And x, in turn, varies
any place from 0 to 1.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.395
So the line integral that
I'm trying to evaluate

00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:35.620
is this particular
double integral.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.120
By the way, we don't
really need this,

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.860
what comes next,
because from here on in,

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.010
this should be old hat.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:43.440
But just by way
of review, notice

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.630
that I could have written this
with the order of integration

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.380
reversed, so that
I wouldn't have

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.870
to worry about an x
squared in the lower limit.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.380
I might like all of my
lower limits to be zero.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.040
Notice I could have
picked a horizontal strip

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.300
and shown that for
a fixed value of y,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.170
x varies from 0 to
the square root of y.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.200
And y varies from 0 to 1.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.910
In any event, this
is just garnishing.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:08.110
This is the easy part.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.280
All I'm saying is,
we now evaluate

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.360
this iterated integral,
integrating with respect to x.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.277
The integrand becomes x
to the fourth minus 3x y

00:23:16.277 --> 00:23:18.785
squared evaluated
between x equals 0,

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:20.940
and x equals the
square root of y.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:25.160
That, of course, leads to y
squared minus 3 y to the 5/2.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.580
I integrate that
between 0 and 1.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.240
I get 1/3 y cubed
minus 6/7 y to the 7/2.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.690
And as y goes from 0 to 1,
this becomes minus 11/21.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.050
By the way, again, I hope it's
clear from previous exercises

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.320
that the minus sign simply
has physical significance.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.430
That all we're saying
is, is that one

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.360
would expect that if
the motion takes place

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.700
in the direction of
the force, the force is

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.640
helping us move the particle.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.652
Whereas if the force is
taking place opposite

00:23:55.652 --> 00:23:57.110
to the direction
of motion, we have

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.850
to push against the force
to get the particle there.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.840
So what we're saying is in one
case, the sense is positive.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.780
The other is negative.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.510
I'm not going to
worry here physically

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.750
about what the meaning
of the minus sign is.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.060
But using Green's theorem,
we have shown what?

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.130
That the integral
around the closed curve

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.560
C, as we've defined C before,
y cubed dx plus x fourth dy,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.920
is minus 11/21.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.950
And what I would like to do
now, to finish today's lesson,

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.730
is to do the same
problem, only doing it

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.730
without Green's theorem.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.820
And again, the point
is to do this problem

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.990
without using Green's theorem.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.020
Remember what my
region was over here.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.700
Without having to refer
back to the previous work.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:43.020
What I'm doing is my curve C
consists of three separate line

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.880
integrals.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.710
C_1 is the curve y equals x
squared as x goes from 0 to 1.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:55.730
C_2 is the curve y equals 1,
where x varies from 1 to 0.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:25:01.170
And the curve C_3 is x equals
0, and y varying continuously

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.250
from 1 to 0.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.270
At any rate, using
the fact that,

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.580
if a curve is the
union of curves,

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.580
that the line integral
around that curve

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.850
is the sum of the integral over
the curves making up the union.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.340
I get that the line
integral along C,

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.070
y cubed dx plus x
to the fourth dy,

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.470
is the sum of these
three line integrals.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.480
In other words, I integrate
along C_1, C_2, and C_3,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.470
where C_1 is y equals x squared.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.390
And x varies
continuously from 0 to 1.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.220
C_2 is the line y equals 1.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.920
And x varies
continuously from 1 to 0.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.680
C_3 is the line x equals 0.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.510
And y varies
continuously from 1 to 0,

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.930
using the concepts
that we talked about

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.130
in the last lecture.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.430
For example, to evaluate this
integral, this will be what?

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:03.690
I replace y by x squared, dy by
2x*dx and integrate as x goes

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.290
from 0 to 1.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:10.140
So my first integral is
simply integral from 0 to 1,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.350
x to sixth dx plus x to
the fourth times 2x*dx.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.790
My second integral, coming back
to here, y is constantly 1.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.820
All right.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.470
So dy is 0.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.890
That makes this term drop out.

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:28.140
Consequently, this
term becomes what?

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.710
1*dx, as x varies
continuously from 1 to 0.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.680
So that integral becomes
integral 1 to 0 dx.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.680
And my final integral,
over C_3, notice,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.240
for that integral x is 0.

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.440
So both this term and
this term drop out.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.590
See x is 0.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.240
So this term drops out.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.690
The fact that x is a
constant makes dx equal to 0.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.500
So this term drops out.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.790
So my integrand is just
0*dy as y goes from 1 to 0.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.960
And to make a long
story short here,

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.020
this integrand is simply
x to the sixth plus 2x

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.300
to the fifth dx from 0 to 1.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.530
This is simply another
way of writing minus 1.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.130
This is 0.

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.810
So my line integral
along the closed curve C

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.500
is 1/7 x to the seventh
plus 1/3 x to the sixth,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.710
evaluated between
0 and 1, minus 1.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:29.340
This comes out to be a 1/7 plus
1/3, which is 10/21 minus 1

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.190
makes this minus 11/21.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.390
And hopefully, that
checks with the answer

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.990
that we got by the
previous method.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.440
And at any rate,
if nothing else,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.570
that is an application as to
how Green's theorem works.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.430
Now what this does as far as
this lecture is concerned,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.570
and the exercises
will bring this out,

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.720
is it ties in line integrals
with multiple integrals.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.590
That will be the last lecture
of this particular block

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.420
of material.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:03.160
And in the next
lesson, what we will do

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.740
is introduce a new
block of material.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.010
We in particular shall
talk about complex numbers.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.550
And that will occupy
us for a little while.

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.770
And at any rate though,
until next time, goodbye.
