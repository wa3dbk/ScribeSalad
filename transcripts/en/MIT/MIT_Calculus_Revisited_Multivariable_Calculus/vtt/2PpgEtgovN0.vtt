00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:33.650
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.080
Hopefully, by now you have
become well experienced

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.430
at computing limits
of double sums.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.300
You've learned to hate
me a little bit more

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.610
because the work was
quite complicated,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.290
and hopefully you are convinced
that there must be an easier

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.250
way to do this stuff.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.680
And fortunately,
the answer is there

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.640
is an easier way sometimes.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.340
And the concept that we're
going to talk about today

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.600
is, again, completely
analogous to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.220
what happened in calculus
of a single variable

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.990
where we showed that the
concept of definite integral

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.360
existed independently of being
able to form derivatives,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.990
but in the case where we knew
a particular function whose

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.180
derivative would
be a given thing,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.830
we were able to perform
the infinite sum--

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.470
or compute the infinite
sum much more readily

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.920
than had we had to rely on the
arithmetic of infinite series.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.700
By the way-- and I'll
mention this later

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.140
in a different context, I
hope-- that the converse problem

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.030
was also true.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.180
In many cases one
did not know how

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.840
to find the required function
with the given derivative,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.770
and in this case knowing how
to find the area by the limit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.330
process was equivalent
to how we were then

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.620
able to invent new functions
which had given derivatives.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.824
Essentially, the
difference in point of view

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.240
was the difference
between what we

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.840
called the first fundamental
theorem of integral calculus,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.450
and the second fundamental
theorem of integral calculus.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.610
As I said, the same
analogy will hold here,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.440
and let's get into this
now without further ado.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.170
I call today's lesson
the fundamental theorem.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.600
And what I'm going to do now
is to pretend that we never

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.800
had the lecture of last time.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.110
That we have never heard
of an infinite sum.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.090
I'm going to introduce
what one calls

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.630
the anti-derivative
of a function of two

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.860
independent variables,
again keeping in mind

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.900
the analogy that for more
than two independent variables

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.480
a similar treatment holds.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080
And the exercises
will include problems

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.150
that have more than two
independent variables.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270
The idea is that
when I write down

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.650
this particular
double integral, if I

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.320
look at the innermost integral,
notice that x appears only

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.470
as a parameter.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.630
That the variable
of integration is y

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.040
notice then, that x is
being treated as a constant.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.350
What this says is what?

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.830
Pick a fixed value of x,
compute this integral,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.670
evaluate this as y
goes from g_1 of x

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.310
to g_2 of x-- the
resulting function is

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.460
a function of x alone--
and integrate that function

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.460
of x from a to b.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.720
And to do that for
you in slow motion,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440
so you see what happens here,
what I'm essentially saying is,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.310
read this thing inside out.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940
Imagine some
brackets placed here.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.240
Not imagine them,
let's put them in.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.000
And what we're saying
is, lookit, first of all,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.800
fix a value of x.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.380
Hold x constant.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.380
And for that fixed value of x,
compute f of x,y dy from g_1

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.280
of x to g_2 of x.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.810
Compute that, remember
you're going to integrate

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.820
that with respect to y.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.236
When you're all
through with this,

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:37.140
because the limits
involve only x,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.980
the integrand that you get--
this bracketed expression will

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.490
now be a function of x
alone, call it h of x.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.230
Integrate h of x
dx between a and b,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.830
and the resulting
expression, assuming

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.910
that you can carry out
the integration of course,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.110
will be a particular number.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.710
That has nothing to do, as I
say, with double sums so far.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.350
Though I suspect that you're
getting a bit suspicious.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.420
And in the same way that
the definite integral was

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.315
a sum and not an
anti-derivative,

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.410
the notation of the
definite integral

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.727
looked enough like the notation
of the indefinite integral,

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:15.560
so we began to suspect
there was going to be

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.890
a connection between them.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.450
That connection is
what's going to be

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.890
called the fundamental
theorem in our present case.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.890
But going on, let me just give
you an example showing you how

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.400
we compute the anti-derivative.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.200
Let's take, for example
interval from 0 to 2,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.210
integral from 0 to x
squared, x cubed y dy dx.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.340
Again we go from
inside to out, the way

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.960
we read this is that we're
integrating with respect to y.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.270
That means we're
holding x constant.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.760
For a fixed value
of x, integrate this

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.320
as y goes from 0 to x squared.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.540
So treating x as a constant,
I integrate this with respect

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.240
to y.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.280
The integral of y
dy is 1/2 y squared.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.250
I evaluate that as y
goes from 0 to x squared.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.670
That's crucial you see.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.940
It's y that goes
from 0 to x squared.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.350
When I replace y
by the upper limit,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.830
I get 1/2 x cubed times the
quantity x squared, squared.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.530
When I replace y by
the lower limit 0,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.450
the integrand vanishes.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.700
So that what I wind up with
is a function of x alone.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.430
Specifically what
function is it?

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.710
It's 1/2 x to the seventh, and I
now integrate that from 0 to 2.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.380
That gives me 1/8 x
to the eighth over 2,

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.350
that's x to the eighth over 16.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.600
Evaluated between 0 and 2.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.030
2 to the eighth over 16
is 2 to the eighth over 2

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.530
to the fourth, which is 2 to
the fourth, which in turn is 16.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.486
So again, notice, I can carry
out this operation purely

00:05:46.486 --> 00:05:47.110
manipulatively.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.660
It is truly the inverse of
taking the partial derivative.

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.530
In the same way that taking
the partial derivative involved

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.190
holding all the variables
but one constant,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.550
taking a partial integral, so
to speak, an anti-derivative,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.870
involves simply doing what?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.540
Integrating, treating all
the variables but the given

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.280
one as a constant.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.740
Which reduces you,
again, to the equivalent

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.470
of what the
anti-derivative meant

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.700
in the calculus of
a single variable.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.730
Now here's where we come to the
so-called fundamental theorem.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.500
Let me tie what we've
talked about today,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.420
and what we talked
about last time.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.150
Let me see if I can't tie
those together for you

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.790
in a completely different way.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.230
Meaning I want you to
see that conceptually,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.710
today's lesson and
last time's lesson

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.600
are completely different,
but the punchline is

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.730
there's a remarkable
connection between the two.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.190
Let's suppose I take
the region R, which

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.290
is a very simple region that's
bounded above by the curve y

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.890
equals g_2 of x.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.950
It's bounded below
by the curve y

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.435
equals g_1 of x, and that
these two curves happen

00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:54.620
to intersect at values
corresponding to x

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.460
equals a and x equals b.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.110
And what I would like to find
is the mass of the region R,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.590
if its density is some
given function f of x, y.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.030
Now, in terms of what
we did last time,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.670
this involved a double sum.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.320
What double sum was it?

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.340
We partitioned this into
rectangles, et cetera.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.105
We picked a particular number
c sub i, j comma d sub i,

00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:26.690
j in the (i, j)-th rectangle.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.880
We computed f of c sub i, j
comma d sub i, j times delta

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.810
a sub i, j, added these all up.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.160
The double sum as i went from
1 to n and j went from 1 to n,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.240
and took the limit as the
maximum delta x_i and delta

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.660
y_j approach 0, and that
limit, if it existed--

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.430
and it would exist if f
was piecewise continuous--

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.090
that limit was denoted by what?

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.480
Double integral over the
region R f of x, y dA.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.990
And that dA could either be
viewed as being dy*dx if you

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.536
wanted, it could be dx*dy,
It could also be, say,

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:10.160
in different coordinate systems,
we're not going to worry about

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.630
that part just yet.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.850
We'll worry about that
in future lectures.

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.820
Now, on the other hand, let's
stop right here for a moment.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.010
Let's see how one
might have been tempted

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.810
to tackle this problem
from a completely

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.250
intuitive point of view.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.230
The so-called
engineering approach,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:30.540
if you would never heard
of the anti-derivative,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.390
anti-derivative for
several variables,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.521
but had taken part
one of our course.

00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:36.770
The engineering approach
would be something like this:

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.700
you would say, let's pick a
very small infinitesimal region

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.400
here, in which we can assume
that the density is constant.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.300
So we'll pick a
little region that's

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.640
a very, very small
rectangle of dimension what?

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.820
We'll say it's dy by dx.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.065
And the density of this
particular rectangle

00:09:00.065 --> 00:09:03.650
can be assumed to be the
constant value f of x, y.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.940
Because that
density is constant,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.125
the mass of this little
piece should be f of x,

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:15.050
y times dy*dx.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.240
and then we say what?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.700
Let's add these all up.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.280
Let's go down to
here we say lookit,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.080
this is a typical element.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.910
And we'll add them all up
for all possible y's and all

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.130
possible x's.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.740
Now how would you
do this intuitively?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.070
You'd say well, lookit,
let me hold x constant.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:36.130
Well, for a constant value
of x-- let's call it x sub 1.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.590
For a constant
value of x, notice

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.190
that y can vary any place--
to be in the region R,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.480
for that fixed value of x, y can
be any place from here to here.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.910
In other words, y
varies continuously

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.660
from g_1 of x_1 to g_2 of x_1.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.115
Or, because x_1 could have
been x, for that given x,

00:09:56.115 --> 00:10:00.440
y varies continuously
from g_1 of x to g_2 of x.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.470
And notice that x
could have been chosen,

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:06.470
if we want to be in the region
R, to be any place from a to b.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.900
And so mechanically,
we might say,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.110
let's just say, here is the
mass of a small element,

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.360
and we'll add these all
up so that for a fixed x,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.040
y goes from g_1
of x to g_2 of x.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.750
And x could be
anywhere from a to b.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.270
And it appears that
this is a truism.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.220
This is not a truism.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.530
It's a rather
remarkable result. It

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.900
is analogous to what happened in
calculus of a single variable.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.890
Namely, notice that when we had
the definite integral from a

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.100
to b, f of x dx, that
was an infinite sum.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.530
It was summation f of
c sub k, delta x sub k,

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.440
as k went from 1 to
n taking the limit

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.750
as the maximum delta
x sub k approached 0.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.850
It turned out that if we
knew a function capital

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.670
F whose derivative was
little f, then this sum

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.460
could be evaluated
by computing capital

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.350
F of b minus capital F of a.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.350
Again the idea being
that if you knew

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.770
a function whose derivative was
f, that gave you an easy way

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.460
to evaluate the sum.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.210
On the other hand,
if you didn't know

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.420
a function whose
derivative was little f,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.260
evaluating the sum
as a limit gave you

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.620
a way of being able to
find the anti-derivative.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.050
A particular case in
point, you may recall,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.140
was trying to handle the problem
e to the minus x squared dx,

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:31.480
as x goes from 0 to 1.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.320
This certainly
existed as an area,

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.970
but we did not
know-- in fact, there

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.620
is no elementary function.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.680
We invented one, called
the error function,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.000
whose derivative is e
to the minus x squared.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.230
So the idea is-- and
this is the key point--

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.790
this is what becomes known
as the fundamental theorem

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.000
for several variables.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.690
That there is a connection
between a double infinite sum,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.220
and a double anti-derivative.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.010
That this particular
expression here

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.270
does not involve
knowing anything

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.010
about partial derivatives.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.080
This particular
expression here does not

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.970
involve any knowledge
of knowing partial sums.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.500
This simply says what?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.470
Integrate this thing twice.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.910
Once holding x
constant and letting y

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.740
go from g_1 of x to g_2
of x, and integrating

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.920
with respect to x.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.740
And the amazing result is
that if f is continuous,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.450
this limit exists,
and in particular,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.710
if we happen to know how
to actually carry out

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:38.480
these repeated or
iterated integrations,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.510
we can compute this
complicated sum simply

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.950
by carrying out this
anti-derivative.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.060
And I think the best
way to emphasize that

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:51.210
to you is to repeat the
punchline to the homework

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.000
exercises of last assignment.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.240
You may recall that last
time we were dealing

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.950
with the square whose vertices
were (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1),

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:02.110
and (0, 1).

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.760
The density of the square
at the point x comma y

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.820
was x squared plus y squared.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.970
And I asked you as
a homework problem

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.430
to compute the mass of this
plate R, to compute it exactly.

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.439
And we said OK, by
definition of-- remember,

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:23.230
this thing here now,
with the R under here,

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.440
indicates a limit
of a double sum.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.290
That this mass was by definition
this particular result.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.870
And notice that
last time we showed,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.790
in terms of double sums,
that this came out to be 2/3.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.860
Let me show you in
terms of our new theory

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.410
how we can find this much more
conveniently, with no sweat,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.550
so to speak.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.360
What I'm going to do now is the
following-- The same analogy

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.470
I used before.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.580
I look at my region here, which
I'll call A, and I say what?

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.030
For a fixed value of x.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.760
For a fixed value
of x, notice that y

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.470
varies continuously from 0 to 1.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.330
See, y varies
continuously from 0 to 1.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.010
And then x, in turn,
could have been chosen

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.700
to be any place from 0 to 1.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.530
That as we run through all these
strips, added up from 0 to 1,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.650
that covers our region R.
So what we're saying is,

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.710
all right, a little element of
our mass will be x squared plus

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.290
y squared dy*dx.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.930
We'll add these all up from
0 to 1, holding x constant.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.140
Then add them all up again,
as x goes from 0 to 1.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.470
Again, this is the
iterated integral.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.990
How do we evaluate this?

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.850
Well we treat x as a constant,
integrate this with respect

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.680
to y.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.280
If we're treating
x as a constant,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.980
this then will come out to be
x squared y, plus 1/3 y cubed,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.580
and we now evaluate that
as y goes from 0 to 1.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.329
Leaving these details
out because they

00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.370
are essentially the calculus
of a single variable

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:00.260
all over again, this turns
out to be the integral from 0

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.990
to 1 x squared
plus 1/3 dx, which

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.690
in turn is 1/3 x cubed
plus 1/3 x, evaluated

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.390
as x goes from 0 to 1.

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.340
The upper limit gives me a third
plus a third, the lower limit's

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.000
0.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.190
The mass here is 2/3, which
checks with the result

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.930
that we got last time.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.070
Again, I'm not going
to go through the proof

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:27.930
of the fundamental theorem, I
don't think it's that crucial.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:31.900
It's available in textbooks
on advanced calculus.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.660
Some of the exercises
may possibly

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.170
give you hints as to how
these results come about.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.960
But by and large,
I'm more interested

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.980
now in you seeing the overview,
and at this stage of the game

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.230
letting you get whatever
specific theoretical details

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.030
you desire on your own.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.950
At any rate, let's
continue on with examples.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.710
I think a very nice
counterpart to example one--

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.170
and to refresh your memories
without looking back at it,

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:06.370
example one asked us to
compute this anti-derivative.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.900
And what I'd like to
do now is to emphasize

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.500
the fundamental theorem by
wording this a different way.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.900
What I want to do now is
to describe the plate R.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.090
If its mass is given by the
double integral over the region

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.170
R, rho of x, y, dA and that
turns out to be integral from 0

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.070
to 2, 0 to x squared,
x cubed y, dy*dx.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.000
What is the region
R, whose-- what

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.900
is this region R, if this
is how its mass is given?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.420
The first thing I
want you to observe

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.990
is that this part here is
identified with the density

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.110
part of the problem.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.210
And that these
limits of integration

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.190
determine the region R.
For example, what this says

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:55.760
is, if you hold x constant,
y varies from 0 to x squared.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.300
Let's see what that means.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.620
If you hold x constant,
y varies from 0-- well y

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.640
equals 0 is the
x-axis-- to y equals

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.240
x squared-- that's this
particular parabola.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:12.800
What this says is, for a fixed
value of x, say x equals x_1,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.920
to be in the region
R, you can be

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.859
any place from the x-axis
along this strip up to y

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:21.560
equals x_1 squared.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.440
So your strip is like this.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.540
Then we're told that in
turn x could be chosen

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.730
to be any place from 0 to 2.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.600
So now what we know
is that this strip

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.080
could have been chosen for any
value of x between 0 and 2.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.070
And what that
tells us therefore,

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.130
is that the shape
of our region R

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.280
is the curve-- the
region that's bounded

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.650
above by the curved y equals x
squared, below by the x-axis,

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.940
and on the right by
the line x equals 2.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.470
This is our region R.
You see, the region R

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.650
is determined by the
limits of integration,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.210
and the density of R
is given by rho of x, y

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.263
equals x cubed y at
the point x comma y.

00:18:06.263 --> 00:18:06.762
OK?

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.700
We'd mentioned before that why
do you have to write dy*dx?

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.740
Couldn't you have written dx*dy?

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.190
What I thought I'd like to do,
for my next example for you,

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.830
is to show you how one
inverts-- or changes--

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.920
the order of integration.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.360
For example, given the same
integral, the same region R,

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.850
suppose we now want to express
the mass in the form double

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.720
integral x cubed y dx*dy?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.830
You see the region R is still
the same as it was before.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.590
But now you see what we want
to do, how would we read this?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.730
This says we're integrating
with respect to x. x is varying.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.030
So this says, for a fixed value
of y, integrate this thing.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:52.100
See, for a fixed value
of y, integrate this.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.880
Evaluated between the
appropriate limits

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.060
of x, in terms of y.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.230
And then integrate
this with respect to y.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.450
Well, what this says is let's
pick a fixed value of y.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.490
Let's say y equals y_1.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.890
For that fixed value of y
notice that the curve y equals

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.480
x squared, for x
positive, in inverted form

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.050
has the form x equals
the square root of y.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.250
So for a fixed
value of y, notice

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:25.340
that x varies from the square
root of y_1 up to x equals 2.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.310
See, x goes from the
square root of y to 2,

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.250
for a fixed value of y.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.350
Now where can y be?

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.840
This is our limits here.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.780
To be in the region
R, y could have

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:42.210
been chosen as low as
this, or as high as this.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.660
In other words y varies
continuously from 0 to 4.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.570
And again, because I don't
want to have our lecture

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.010
obscured by
computational detail,

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.580
I simply urge you
to-- on your own--

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.830
compute this double integral,
compute the double integral

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.720
that we obtained in
example number three,

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.150
and show that the
answers are the same.

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:09.080
What I do want you to observe is
how different the limits look.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.440
Notice that in the other
integral it was from 0 to 2

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.010
outside, now it's from 0 to 4.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.190
Notice also on the
inside integral

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.180
it was from 0 to x squared.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.570
Now it's from the
square root of y to 2.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.530
There is no mechanical way
of doing this, at least

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.370
in the two-dimensional
case, we can

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.110
see from the picture
what's happening.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.190
In the multi-dimensional
case, we

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.100
have to resort to the
theory of inverse functions,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.260
and this becomes, at best,
a very messy procedure.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.070
Of course, the answer is, if
it's such a messy procedure,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.790
why bother with it?

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.060
And so in terms of another
example that I would like

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.470
to show you, let me give you
an illustration in which it

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.870
may be possible to find
the required answer if we

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.060
integrated one order, but not
if we integrate with respect

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.060
to the other order.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.470
Let me evaluate the double
integral 0 to 2, x to 2,

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.290
e to the y squared, dy*dx.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.070
Again, let me see if I
can at least write down

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:08.950
what this thing
means geometrically

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.490
before I even begin.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.190
Notice that I can think
of this as a plate R,

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.340
whose density at the point x
comma y is e to the y squared,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.250
and what is the
shape of this plate?

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.740
Integrate with
respect to y first.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.050
For a fixed value
of x, y goes from y

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.310
equals x-- well that's this
line here-- to y equals 2.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.830
That's this line here.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:37.280
So for a fixed x, y varies
continuously from here to here.

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.340
x can be any place from 0 to 2.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.970
That happens to be the
point 2 comma 2 where

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.310
these two lines intersect.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.870
So the region R is this
rectangular region here.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.160
OK, this is our region
R. And what we're saying

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.180
is find the mass
of the region R,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.119
if its density at the point x
comma y is e to the y squared.

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:01.410
Now, notice that this density
exists even if I've never

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:03.190
heard of the anti-derivative.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.530
If, however I elect to use
the fundamental theorem,

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:11.290
and I say OK, what I'll
do is I'll compute this.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:13.660
Notice I'm back
to an old bugaboo.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.720
I don't know how to integrate
e to the y squared dy,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.340
other than by an approximation.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.050
In terms of
elementary functions,

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.210
there is no function whose
derivative with respect to y

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.240
is e to the y squared.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.590
So what I do is
I elect to change

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.490
the order of integration.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.630
Why is that?

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:34.820
Well, because if I change
the order of integration,

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.160
sure I'm integrating
e to the y squared,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.520
but now with respect to x, which
means that e to the y squared

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.860
is a constant.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.660
This is trivial to integrate.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.200
It's just going to be x
times e to the y squared.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.000
The problem is what?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.070
If I'm going to
change the order here,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.230
I must make sure
that I take care

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.260
of the limits of
integration accordingly.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.472
Now what this says is what?

00:22:57.472 --> 00:22:58.930
I'm going to
integrate with respect

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.260
to x first. x is
going to vary, so I'm

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.900
treating y as a constant.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.510
For that constant
value of y, notice

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:11.030
that to be in the region R,
for that constant value of y,

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.310
our x varies from what?

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:20.000
x varies from 0 to the line
y equals x, or accordingly x

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.050
equals y.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:26.710
So for that fixed
value of y, x varies

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.120
from x equals 0 to x equal y.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.270
And correspondingly,
y can be chosen

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.300
to be any fixed number
between 0 and 2,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.840
and that gives me this
particular double integral.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.720
And by the way, from this point
on, the rest is child's play.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.860
Because when I
integrate this, you see,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.005
this integrand is x
e to the y squared.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.760
When x is equal to y, this
becomes y e to the y squared.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.340
When x is 0 the lower
limit drops out.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:03.040
So what I want to
integrate now is 0 to 2 y

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.750
e to the y squared dy.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.460
But this is beautiful for me,
because the factor of y in here

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.080
is exactly what I need to
be able to handle this.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.940
In other words, this is
nothing more than 1/2

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.340
e to the y squared
evaluated between 0 and 2.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.810
Replacing y by two gives
me 1/2 e to the fourth.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.070
Replacing y by 0-- remember
e to the 0 is one--

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:29.130
gives me minus 1/2, because I'm
subtracting the lower limit.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.690
The answer to evaluating
this integral-- which

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.526
was impossible to do in this
form, because of the fact

00:24:35.526 --> 00:24:37.900
that there was no elementary
function whose derivative is

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:41.280
e to the y squared--
turns out quite nicely

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.710
to be given by e to the
fourth minus 1 over 2.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.090
To summarize today's
lecture, to show you

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.950
what the fundamental theorem
really means, all we're saying

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.110
is that we often compute
the infinite double sum--

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:01.050
double integral R, f of x, y,
dA by an appropriate iterated

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.560
integral.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.930
That's-- what we mean is what?

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.340
The anti-derivative.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.850
Integrating-- taking the
anti-derivative successively.

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.270
Iterated integral.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.040
See?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.820
Iterated integral.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.230
And conversely.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.400
In other words, the
gist of this whole thing

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.860
is that we now have two
entirely different topics that

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.600
are related by a fantastic
unifying thread that

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.900
allows us to solve
one of the problems

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.320
in terms of the
other, and vice versa.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.010
You see, again, the
analogy being complete

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:39.420
with what happened in the
calculus of a single variable.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.430
That we can evaluate
double sums,

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.640
which was the aim of
the previous lecture,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.920
by means of an
iterated integral.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.060
We can evaluate iterated
integrals, sometimes,

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.270
by appropriately knowing
how to find the limit

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.040
of an appropriate double sum.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.250
And again we shall make use
of this in the exercises.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.670
We will go into this in more
detail from other aspects,

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.400
and other points
of view next time.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.200
At any rate, until
next time, goodbye.
