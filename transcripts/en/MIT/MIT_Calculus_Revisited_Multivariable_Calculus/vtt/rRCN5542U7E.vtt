00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.862
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:34.320
I was just thinking
of a story that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.490
came to mind about the
woman who went on vacation.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.220
And she said, "We
went to Majorca."

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.120
And her friend said to
her, "Where's that?"

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.494
And she said, "How
should I know?

00:00:42.494 --> 00:00:43.460
We flew."

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.240
And today we're going to
fly through matrix algebra.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.770
In other words, we're going
to devote an entire lecture

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.180
to the subject called
matrix algebra, which

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.930
is a rather fast pace
from one point of view.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.620
From another point of view,
it's a rather slow pace

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.370
because hopefully, by this
stage in the development

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.660
of our course, we're
pretty well familiar

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.650
with what we mean by
the game of mathematics.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.770
And hence, in
particular, if we now

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.650
try to make a structure
out of matrices,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.480
we should be in
pretty good position

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.630
to generalize many
of our early remarks.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.360
Let me say at the outset that
whereas matrices in general

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.580
can be m rows by n columns,
the interesting case

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760
occurs when m and n are equal.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.560
In other words, the
interesting case

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.720
is when a matrix
has the same number

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.940
of rows as it has columns.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.510
And again, using
as our motivation

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.100
a system of equations, the
easiest way to see this

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.040
is that, for
example, if you have

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.230
a certain number of equations
and a certain number

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.860
of unknowns, the
really interesting case

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.340
occurs when you have
just as many equations

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.810
as you have unknowns.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.410
For example, if you have
more unknowns than equations,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.800
you usually have quite a
few degrees of freedom.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.480
In other words, a
far-fetched case,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.090
suppose I have one equation
with fifteen unknowns.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.630
Then you see, I
can pick fourteen

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.240
of the unknowns in
general at random

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.300
and solve for the
fifteenth in terms

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.760
of the specific
choices of the fourteen

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.470
that I picked at random.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.110
On the other hand, if I were to
have fifteen equations and just

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.810
one unknown, the chances are I
would have some contradictions.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.480
Because after all,
with only one unknown,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.800
I could only impose
one condition.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.930
And therefore, given
fifteen conditions--

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.540
unless they were all
equivalent conditions--

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.550
I might wind up with
a contradiction.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.690
So in general, the easiest
way to summarize this

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.910
is that when you have
more unknowns than you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.900
have equations, you usually get
too many answers to a problem.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.560
And if you have more equations
then you have unknowns,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.930
you usually get too few
answers, where by too few,

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.230
you mean none.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.890
So the interesting
case, as I say,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.330
is when you have the same
number of unknowns as equations.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.970
Motivating matrices
from this point of view,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.480
the game of matrices will
be played in our course

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.350
as follows.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.620
We will let the set S sub
n denote the set of all n

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.800
by n matrices.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.450
In other words, n could
be 3. n could be 4.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.110
It could be 2.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.140
It could be 5.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.900
But whatever value we
choose for n, for example,

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.880
S sub 5 would be what?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.630
The set of all 5 by 5 matrices.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.720
So we're just gonna
deal with a general n.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.270
By the way, I should point
out that these computations

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.440
get kind of sticky.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.780
So we will, for
illustrative purposes,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.790
usually pick examples with
n equals 2 or n equals 3

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.690
just so that we can
see what's going on.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.540
But the notation
that we'll use is

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.170
that if the matrix A
is a member of S sub

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.510
n, what does that mean?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.030
A belongs to S
sub n means that A

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.450
is an n by n matrix, which
usually is written this way.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.140
And if you wish to abbreviate
it, we just write what?

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.810
The square brackets and a sub
ij inside the brackets this way.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.540
Now again, keep in mind
that to play any game,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.470
it's not enough to
have the equipment.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.970
We have to have the
rules which defines

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.400
for us how the terms behave.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.110
So we're going to define
equality of two matrices

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.120
as follows.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.220
Given the two
matrices A and B, we

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.360
will define them to be equal
if and only if entry by entry

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.460
they happen to be equal.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.270
In other words, the
term in the i-th row,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.840
j-th column of the
first matrix has

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.050
to be the same as the term
in the i-th row, j-th column

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.614
of the second matrix for all
possible values of i and j.

00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:40.030
And again, if you
want to motivate

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.110
why we choose this
kind of a definition--

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.530
even though definitions do not
have to be defended-- notice

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.140
that as soon as you change
some of the coefficients--

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.370
if you change even one
coefficient of an equation

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.600
given n equations
with n unknowns,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.710
as soon as you change
one of the coefficients,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.410
you've changed the
system of equations.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.280
Therefore, for these systems to
be exactly equal you want what?

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.590
Term by term equality.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.210
And correspondingly, to
add two n by n matrices,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.110
in other words to add the
matrix A to the matrix B,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.350
we define the rule to be what?

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.820
That the sum of
these two matrices

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.520
is the matrix C where
each element of C

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.060
is obtained by the term by term
addition of the elements in A

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.670
and B. In other words,
we add two matrices

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.030
by adding them entry by entry.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.890
In other words, we
add the two entries

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.560
in the first row,
first column to obtain

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.820
the entry in the first
row, first column

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.040
of the sum, et cetera.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.950
In other words, we
add term by term.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.930
As far as multiplication
is concerned-- and again,

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.580
this is the point I was
making in the last lecture

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.670
and which I like to
keep re-emphasizing

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.920
because it's very important.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.480
One would like to say
something like, "Gee, it

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.990
was very natural to add
two matrices term by term.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.980
Why don't we multiply
them term by term?"

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.270
And the answer is certainly
you could have made up

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.110
a game of matrices in which
the product of two matrices

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.820
was obtained by multiplying
the matrices term by term.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.810
However, if we keep in
mind what problem we

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.220
want matrix multiplication
to solve-- in other words,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.480
notice now, we are playing
the game of matrices the way

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.010
the real-life
scientist plays games,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.530
not the way the abstract
mathematician plays games.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.340
You see, in mathematics
what we essentially

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.030
say is, let's make up the rules
and we'll worry about models

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.810
that obey the rules later.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.050
In real life we say, let's
look at a model that we need,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.580
a physical, realistic model.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.720
And then based on the
properties that this model has,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.410
let's make up the abstract
rules that govern the system.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.230
And what we saw in
the last lecture

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.730
was that the sensible definition
of matrix multiplication,

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.680
in terms of a chain rule, was
that to multiply two matrices,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.880
to get the term in the
i-th row, j-th column,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.310
you dot the i-th row
of the first matrix

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.680
with the j-th column
of the second matrix.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.000
And the way we write that--
and again, this notation may

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.530
seem a little bit heavy to you.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.020
But all it does is it
states symbolically what

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.080
we said in words last time.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.840
What we're saying is
that to dot the i-th row

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.040
with the j-th column, notice
that the i-th row is always

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.510
prefixed by the first
subscript being i.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.010
Whereas the second subscript k
can run the whole gamut from 1

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.560
through n.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.150
In other words, the
second subscript

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.210
can denote any column you want.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.440
Correspondingly, to
indicate that you've

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.270
stayed in the j-th column,
the row can be arbitrary.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.230
And that means, again, that
the subscript k, denoting

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.410
the row of the B matrix, can
run the full gamut from 1 to n.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.320
In other words,
this formal set-up

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.170
here simply says in
mathematical, concise language

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.560
the statement that we
said verbally before.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.120
Namely, to find the i,j-th
term in the product,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.390
dot the i-th row of the first
matrix with the j-th column

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.790
of the second matrix.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.930
And again, I suspect
that the easiest

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.680
way to see all of
these things is

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.100
in terms of a specific example.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.580
And again, the simplest
example I can think of

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:24.110
will involve the 2 by
2 case, n equals 2.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.710
So by means of
illustration, let A

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:30.930
be the 2 by 2 matrix all
of whose entries are 1.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.480
Let B be the 2 by 2 matrix
all whose entries are 1.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.760
Except in the first row, second
column the entry will be a 2.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.970
Now, my first claim
is that in terms

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.450
of our definition of
equality, matrix A

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.050
is unequal to matrix
B. Why is that?

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:56.110
Well, notice that they
differ in the what?

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.190
First row, second entry.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.840
In other words a
sub 1,2, the entry

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.940
of A matrix in the first
row, second column, is 1.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.710
Whereas the entry of the
B matrix in the first row,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.980
second column is 2.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.140
Don't say, gee, they
look equal almost

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.900
because three out of
the four match up.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.170
Remember, equality by
definition says what?

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.720
Entry by entry.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.860
Three out of four
isn't good enough.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.360
It has to be all four.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.780
Therefore, this matrix A
is not equal to matrix B.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.390
How do we add two matrices?

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.010
Well, to add them,
we said that we

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.880
would add them entry by entry.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.280
Therefore, the first row,
first column of the sum

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.200
should be obtained by adding
the first row, first column

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.940
terms in each matrix
together, et cetera.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.550
And just going through this
quickly, we would get what?

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.180
1 plus 1 is 2.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.330
1 plus 2 is 3.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.520
1 plus 1 is 2 again.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.230
1 plus 1 is still 2 over here.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.470
In other words A
plus B in this case

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:03.590
would be the two by two
matrix [2, 3; 2, 2].

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.660
Now, how do we multiply
the two matrices A and B?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.010
Remember what the rules
were for multiplication.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.790
To multiply A by
B, to find the term

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:17.130
in the first row, first column,
we dot the first row of A

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.720
with the first column
of B. That gives us

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.860
1 times 1, which is 1, plus
1 times 1, which is also 1.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.610
The sum is therefore 2.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.180
So the entry in our first
row, first column is a 2.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.820
To find the entry
which turns out

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:34.710
to be 3 in the first row, second
column, how do we do that?

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.625
We dot what?

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:37.480
We want what?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.490
First row, second column.

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.930
We dot the first row of
A with the second column

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:47.060
B. We get 1 times
2 plus 1 times 1.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.360
2 plus 1 is 3, et cetera.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.150
Carrying out the
details, the matrix A

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.510
multiplied by the
matrix B in this case

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.220
would be the matrix [2, 3]
in the first row, [2, 3]

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.940
in the second row.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.740
By the way, B times
A would involve what?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.300
Writing the matrix B first
followed by the matrix A.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.560
And leaving the
details for you, just

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.090
to check out for
yourselves, notice-- well,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.690
let me just do one for you.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.810
Suppose I want to see
what was in the first row,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.320
first column here.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.320
I would have to do what?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.730
Dot the first row of B
with the first column of A,

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.900
the first row of B with
the first column of A.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.650
That gives me 1 times 1
plus 2 times 1, which is 3.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.740
And by the way, even if
I went no further here,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.890
notice that already tells
me, in this case at least,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:48.420
that A*B is unequal
to B*A. Why is that?

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.310
Because the entry
in the first row,

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.910
first column of A*B
happens to be 2.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.920
The entry in the first row,
first column of B*A happens

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.300
to be 3.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.300
And we've already seen that
for two matrices to be equal,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.740
they must be equal
entry by entry.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.160
And they're already
unequal in the entry

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.110
in the first row, first column.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:12.790
So notice, by the way, that
matrix multiplication need not

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.670
be commutative.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.700
And you see this is a glaring
distinction between matrix

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.940
multiplication and numerical
multiplication, where

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.700
when we multiply two
numbers, the product does not

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.840
depend on the order in
which they're written.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.020
But when we multiply
two matrices,

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.967
our definition is
such that the product

00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:32.050
does depend on the order
in which they're written.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.133
And you might say, well
isn't that an awful thing?

00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:34.900
Well, maybe it is.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.960
But notice that once we pick
the definition that we want,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.230
we have to let the properties
fall where they will.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.290
And by the way, it
is nice to notice--

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.370
and again, I will
leave the details out.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:47.180
They are in the notes.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.670
You'll be checked on these in
the exercises and the like.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.900
But the interesting
point is that most

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.220
of the rules of
numerical arithmetic

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.060
are obeyed by matrix arithmetic.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.980
And let me just go
through a few of those

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.740
with you, just
mentioning what they are.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.550
Notice, again, the wording here.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.010
I call these
properties of the game

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.270
rather than, in terms of
our usual game notation,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.940
the rules of the game.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.290
Notice that we sort of
refer to things as being

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.700
rules when you make up
the game abstractly.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.000
On the other hand, when
you start with a model

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.770
and tell what addition,
multiplication, and equality

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.470
means, from these
definitions you

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.180
deduce properties of the system.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.200
So the properties of the game
of matrices, meaning what?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.440
The properties based
on the interpretation

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.580
that we're giving this in
terms of the calculus course,

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:41.760
the systems of equations.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.190
You see, there are other
ways of introducing matrices.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.210
For the calculus
course, we elected

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:48.660
to do it in terms of
systems of equations.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.970
But at any rate, you can
check the following things out

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.060
quite easily.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.090
First of all, if A and
B are any two matrices,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.390
A plus B is equal to B plus A.
And that follows, of course,

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:02.510
from the fact that when
you add two matrices,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.250
you add them entry by
entry, and the entries

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.590
happen to be numbers.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.060
And the sum of two
numbers does not

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.360
depend on the order in
which you write the numbers.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.390
In other words A plus
B does equal B plus A.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:19.480
Similarly, if you
add B plus C to A,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.140
it's the same thing as if
you added C to A plus B.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.690
In other words, the addition
of matrices is associative.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.300
The answer does not depend
on the sum, does not

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.080
depend on voice inflection.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.330
A plus (B plus C) is
the same as (A plus B)

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.330
plus C. Again, notice
how this obeys the rules

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.290
of ordinary arithmetic.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.470
Thirdly, if I define
the zero matrix

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.620
to be the matrix each
of whose entries is 0,

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.850
then I claim that if I add the
zero matrix on to any matrix A,

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.290
the result must still
be the matrix A.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.210
And this is also a
triviality to check.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.670
Namely, how do you
add two matrices?

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.590
You add them term by term.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.130
But every term in
the zero matrix is 0,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.120
and adding 0 on to a number
doesn't change the number.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.300
Consequently, if
you, term by term,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.870
add 0 onto the entries
in A, you still

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.200
have the entries in A intact.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.840
So A plus 0 is A.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.520
And finally the
rule of inverses.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.650
Namely, if A is the matrix each
of those entries we'll call

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:31.350
a sub i,j, then if I add minus
A onto A, the result will be 0,.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.850
Where by minus A I mean what?

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.470
The matrix each of whose entries
is negative a_(i,j) The reason

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.150
being, again, that when you add
two matrices you add them term

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.270
by term.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:46.900
Every time I add on the negative
of a number to the number

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.110
itself, I get the zero number.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:54.300
Consequently, every entry in
the sum of A and negative A

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.370
will be 0.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.030
And by definition,
that's the zero matrix.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.920
Point I want to mention is
to observe that with the zero

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.400
matrix, defined as
we've defined it,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.110
and the negative
of a matrix defined

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.490
as we have defined it, that
the rules for matrix addition

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:14.440
are exactly the same
structurally as the rules

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.510
for numerical addition.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.990
And that means that with
respect to addition,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.560
we cannot distinguish matrix
algebra from arithmetic

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.520
algebra, numerical algebra.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.190
In fact, many of the rules of
multiplication for matrices

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.510
are the same as for numerical
multiplication as well.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:37.350
Namely, one can show that
if you multiply the matrix

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:42.210
A by the product of
the matrices B and C,

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.870
that this is the same
as multiplying A times

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.190
B by the matrix C.
These can be checked

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.270
by longhand computation.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.360
I have you do some of these
things in the exercises.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.590
Similarly, one can prove
that matrix multiplication

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:57.620
is distributive.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.030
That if you multiply a matrix
by the sum of two matrices,

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:07.020
A times (B plus C) is the same
as A times B plus A times C.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.150
And another rule
that's interesting,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.599
there is a matrix that plays
the role of the number 1.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.430
And surprisingly enough,
it's not the matrix

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.790
all of whose entries are 1.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.640
It's the matrix all
of whose entries

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:26.480
are 1 on the main diagonal
and 0's every place else.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.119
That may sound surprising.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.720
You say, "Gee, the zero matrix
is when I had all zeroes,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.230
why shouldn't the unit matrix
be when I have all 1's?"

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.330
And the answer is, if we were
to multiply two matrices term

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:41.620
by term, then the unit
matrix would've been all 1's.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.610
But remember, we agreed not to
multiply matrices term by term.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:47.110
We agreed to do what?

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.010
Dot the i-th row of the
first with the j-th column

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.960
of a second.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.100
And if we do that,
like it or not,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.310
this is what the matrix
has to look like.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.340
In other words, let me take
the matrix in the 3 by 3 case,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.260
because that's
complicated enough

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.960
to have you see the overall
picture and simple enough

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.620
so it doesn't take
pages of computation.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.630
Let me take the 3 by 3 matrix,
which I'll just quickly write

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.600
as [a, b, c; d, e, f; g, h, i]
and multiply that

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.270
by [1, 0, 0; 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 1].

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.250
You see, that's the
matrix that has what?

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.900
1's in the main diagonal
and 0's every place else.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.980
Look what happens.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.570
When I look, for
example, for the term

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.130
in the second row,
third column--

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.720
second row, third column--
look what's going to happen?

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.940
The d multiplies 0,
that gives me zero.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.040
The e multiplies
0, that gives me 0.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.260
And the f multiplies
1, which gives me f.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.810
In other words, the term in
the second row, third column

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.890
is going to be f, which
is exactly what it should

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.950
be if we claim that the
product matrix is going to be

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.650
the same as the first matrix.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.920
In other words, notice
that this set up

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.240
is such that you're going
to get 0's every place

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.370
but when the term in
question comes up.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.041
And I don't want to go through
that in too much detail for you

00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:11.290
because I think that as you
just play with this thing,

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.415
you'll see it for yourself.

00:19:12.415 --> 00:19:14.260
Let me do just quickly one more.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:21.875
Suppose you wanted the term in
the third row, second column.

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:23.375
You see what's going
to happen here.

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.740
The g multiplies 0,
which yields a 0.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.840
The h multiplies 1,
which yields an h.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.630
And the i multiplies
a 0, which yields a 0.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.580
So the dot product is
just going to be h itself,

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:38.730
as it should be.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.270
And so you see,
what I'm saying is,

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.280
by my definition of
matrix multiplication,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:50.040
if I define the matrix I sub n
to be the matrix each of whose

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.700
entries is 0, except, on
the main diagonal they're

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.920
1-- another way of writing that
is that the entries-- in fact,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.040
we could write this way.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.320
The entries, let's
call this delta_(i,j).

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.480
And what you're saying is that
delta_(i,j) is 0 when i is

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.960
unequal to j.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.630
And it's equal to
1 when i equals j.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.010
And what we're saying
is that if you define

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:23.500
I sub n to be that matrix,
if you multiply A by I sub n,

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.530
it's the same as
multiplying I sub n by A.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.660
And the result will always be A.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.350
By the way, one of
your first objections

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.470
might be, isn't this redundant?

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:37.830
Why do you have to write that A
times I sub n is the same as I

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.260
sub n times A?

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.070
Well, recall that
in our first example

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.410
we showed that A
times B did not have

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.790
to be the same as B
times A. In other words,

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.410
note that this remark
that A times I sub n

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.470
equals I sub n times
A is not redundant.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.230
In general, the
product of two matrices

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.680
depends on the order in
which they're written.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.770
And that leads me, then,
into my next subtopic.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.420
And that is, where
is matrix algebra

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.365
different from
numerical algebra?

00:21:09.365 --> 00:21:11.140
In other words, what
are the differences

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.560
between matrix algebra
and the usual algebra?

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.750
We've already seen
one difference.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:21.190
One difference is that A*B need
not equal B*A. In other words,

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.600
I could find A and B such that
A times B equals B times A.

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.570
But in general, given
A and B at random,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.600
there is no reason to presuppose
that A times B has to equal B

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.070
times A. And again, there
are plenty of drill exercises

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:37.750
on this particular point.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.940
The second major
difference between this

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.090
and numerical arithmetic is
the existence of inverses.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:50.020
In other words, given a matrix
A which is not the zero matrix,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.640
the matrix called A
inverse need not exist.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.540
Now what do you
mean by A inverse?

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.540
The inverse of a number
means a number such

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.710
that when you multiply it by
that given number you get one.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.290
Therefore, inverse
matrices would be what?

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.980
An inverse would
be that matrix such

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.180
that when you
multiply it by A, you

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.820
get the identity matrix I sub n,
in other words, the matrix that

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.980
has 0's every place except
1's on the main diagonal.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.770
And what I'm saying is that
whether we like it or not,

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.140
it turns out that
given the matrix A,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.850
you cannot always solve the
matrix equation A times X

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.020
equals I sub n.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.330
In other words, what it
means in terms of equations

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.170
is given n equations
and n unknowns,

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.750
you may not always be able
to invert the equations.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.420
In other words, given the y's
in terms of the x's, it's not

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.830
always possible to solve
uniquely for the x's in terms

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.960
of the y's.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.840
Again, I'm just trying to
give you an overview here.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.630
So a more detailed
remark or an explanation

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.730
about what I'm saying will be in
the notes and in the exercises.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:03.120
But the key point is that not
all matrices are invertible.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.490
And again, the easiest
way to see this

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.650
is to explicitly go into a 2
by 2 matrix and take a look.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:15.000
Let's take here as an example
the 2 by 2 matrix [1, 2; 2, 4].

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.170
Let X be the matrix [x sub
1,1, x sub 1,2; x sub 2,1,

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.870
x sub 2,2].

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.080
Now, I know how to
multiply two matrices.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.450
I multiply A times X. I
obtain the matrix written down

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:34.030
over here: x sub 1,1 plus 2
x sub 2,1; 2 x sub 1,1 plus 4

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.510
x sub 2,1; et cetera.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:41.210
I sub 2, by definition, is
the matrix [1, 0; 0, 1].

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.340
And to say that A
sub X equals I sub 2

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.820
means that this
matrix, term by term,

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.950
must be the same as this matrix.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.410
In particular, if
we just focus--

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.310
let me just get a piece
of chalk over here--

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:58.330
if we just focus our attention
on this having to be the same

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.340
as this and this having to
be the same as, this leads

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.490
to the fact that (x sub 1,1)
plus 2(x sub 2,1) has to equal

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.430
1.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:12.310
This says that 2(x sub 1,1) plus
4(x sub 2,1) has to equal 0.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.190
And I claim that right away
this shows that it's impossible

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.280
for there to be numbers
x_(1,1) and x_(2,1) that exist.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.910
Because, lookit, if we
found two numbers x sub 1,1

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.240
and x sub 2,1 that obeyed
these two equations,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.910
we would have
proved that 2 equals

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.300
0, which as I told
you before is only

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.620
true for small values
of zero, right.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.020
No, lookit, if this
were true, just

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.710
multiply both sides
of this equation by 2.

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:40.790
It would say what?

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:46.450
That 2 times x sub 1,1 plus
4 times x sub 2,1 equals 2.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:50.690
But at the same time, that
same quantity must equal 0.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:57.600
And since this is impossible, it
means that this matrix does not

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.100
exist.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.220
In other words, it is
impossible-- we've just

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.320
shown it-- to find
numbers that I can plug in

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.360
here such that when I multiply
this matrix by this matrix,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.950
I get this matrix.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.280
That's the best proof that
A inverse need not exist.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.090
Namely what?

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.860
Show one matrix A for which
A inverse doesn't exist.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.760
That's all you have to do to
show that an inverse doesn't

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.470
have to exist.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.260
Just show one case.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.360
One counterexample is
all it takes, right.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.750
So what's the point?

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.410
The point is we must
beware of results

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.950
which require A inverse.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:33.830
Well let's think back
to ordinary arithmetic.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.120
What results required the
existence of an inverse?

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.720
Well, for example, in
ordinary arithmetic,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.790
if the product of two numbers
was 0, one of the factors

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.650
had to be 0.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:45.990
And we proved that by
multiplying both sides

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.240
of the equation by A inverse.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.650
Well, we don't have inverses
necessarily in matrix algebra.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.960
So for example,
in matrix algebra,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.880
it's possible that the
product of two matrices

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.890
gives you the zero matrix, yet
neither of the two matrices

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.590
itself is the zero matrix.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.910
Or, another
consequence of inverse,

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.900
in matrix multiplication
it's possible

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:15.110
that A times B can equal A
times C, yet A need not be 0

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.300
nor B need equal
C. In other words,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:23.350
we can have A times B equals
A times C even though A is not

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.620
the zero vector and
B is not equal to C.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.690
Again, the beauty of
an arithmetic course

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.250
is that we don't
have to hand wave.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.080
We can make the emotional,
subjective statements,

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.860
but we can back them
up simply by showing

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.530
the existence of examples.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.360
So to illustrate my claims here,
let me just do this, as I say,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.500
by means of an example.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.820
Let's take the matrix
that we took in example 2.

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.050
Let A be the matrix
[1, 2; 2,  4].

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.690
Is that the zero matrix?

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.250
No, it's not the zero matrix.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.860
Why?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.320
Because the zero matrix
must have zero entries

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.090
every place, and this doesn't
have zero entries every place.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:04.250
Let's just, out of the hat, pull
out the matrix [2, 2; -1, -1].

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.040
And again, without going through
every single detail here,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.040
if I multiply this
matrix times this matrix,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.050
the result is the zero matrix.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.340
For example just by way of
illustration, 1 times 2 is 2.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.530
2 times minus 1 is minus 2.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.630
2 plus minus 2 is 0.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.240
That accounts for the 0 here.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.030
If I check this
whole thing through,

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.070
I will find that every
entry here must be 0.

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.420
Therefore, I have what?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.100
Two matrices, neither of
which is the zero matrix,

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:36.010
yet their product
is the zero matrix.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.470
On the other hand, let me
now take the same matrix,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.960
[1 2; 2 4] and multiply
that by another matrix

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.260
that I pull out of the hat.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.600
The one I'm gonna pull out
of the hat is [-2, -6; 1, 3].

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.470
And again, just to do a
quick check over here,

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.870
let's check the product in
the second row, second column.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:56.840
It's what?

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.950
2 times minus 6 is minus 12.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.630
4 times 3 is 12.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.690
Minus 12 plus 12 is 0.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.230
In other words, this times
this, neither matrix here

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.680
is the zero matrix, yet the
product is a zero matrix.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.620
And by the way, before I
make a further comment here,

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.110
let me say I didn't really
pull these out of the hat.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.900
I leave this as an
exercise for you to do.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.370
But there are
infinitely many matrices

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.880
that I can multiply this matrix
by and get the zero matrix.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.780
In fact, all I have
to do is make sure

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.210
that the matrix I
multiply this by

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:35.460
has the property that
the first row is minus

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.540
twice the second row.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:41.950
And if you don't know
where I get that from,

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:43.290
all I do is what?

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:45.580
I solve, again, the
matrix equation.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.040
I let X be the matrix
I'm looking for.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.650
I take [1, 2; 2, 4], multiply
it by X, equate it to 0,

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:55.900
and see what conditions are
imposed on my coefficients.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.740
Again, this is not the
point of our overview here.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.350
You can do that in
the homework exercises

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.520
in the reading material.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.170
But the key point is,
what I have done is what,

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.750
as far as this is concerned?

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:09.490
Look at these two examples.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.250
This matrix times this
one is the zero matrix.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.960
This times this is
the zero matrix.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:21.030
Therefore, this times this is
the same as this times this.

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:27.270
Notice that this term
equals this term, right.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.750
And what I'm driving at is
that here is a case where

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.770
this is not the zero matrix.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.280
The second factors are
not equal to each other.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.250
You see this matrix does
not equal this matrix.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.900
Yet when I cancel
this, I can not

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.406
conclude that this matrix
equals this matrix.

00:29:43.406 --> 00:29:44.780
In other words,
here I have what?

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:50.660
A times B equals A times C.
Yet A is not the zero matrix,

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.460
and the matrix B is not
equal to the matrix C.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.900
And so what have I proven?

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.150
I've proven that it is
not necessarily true

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:03.230
that for matrices, when it
comes to cancellation of factors

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:04.750
when you're
multiplying, that you

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.530
can take the same
liberties that you

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.770
can in numerical arithmetic.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.840
And this is a very
troublesome thing.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.970
This bothers people.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.710
It means that we have to be
particularly careful when

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.970
we do the arithmetic of
matrices to make sure

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.230
that we're dealing with what?

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.360
Invertible matrices.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.610
What it means, again, is that
if the system of equations that

00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:28.620
the matrix is coding is such
that the matrix does not have

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.510
an inverse, it means that
somehow or other we cannot

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.180
invert the system of equations.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.260
And so what we do in the
study of matrix algebra

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.330
is we single out a
particularly important subset

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.600
of the matrices.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.890
Namely, we have a special
interest in those matrices A

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:50.400
for which A inverse exists.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.720
And because we have that
special interest, what

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:57.330
we do is we define a matrix,
give it a special name

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.800
if it has an inverse.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.580
Namely, a definition is what?

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:03.710
The matrix A is
called non-singular

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.290
provided A inverse exists.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.940
Now what's the beauty of
non-singular matrices?

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.260
The beauty of
non-singular matrices

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.330
is if you happen
to know that you're

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.240
dealing with a
non-singular matrix,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.780
then you can take the
same arithmetic liberties

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.170
that you could with numbers.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.100
For example, let me just give
you an illustration here.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.430
Suppose I know that A*B
equals A*C where A, B,

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.810
and C are matrices.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:35.160
And I happen to also know that A
is non-singular, in other words

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.760
that A inverse exists.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.480
I claim that with this
extra piece of information,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.770
provided I know that
A is non-singular,

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.540
I claim that from
A*B equals A*C,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.900
I can conclude that B equals
C. Not only can I conclude it,

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.750
but I can conclude it as
a corollary to numerical

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.300
arithmetic.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.710
Because remember, how did we
prove in numerical arithmetic

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.580
that you could
have cancellation?

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.390
All it required was that
the number being canceled

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:02.850
had to have an inverse.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.290
I can parrot the
proof word for word.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.880
Namely, I'm given that
A*B equals A*C. I say, OK,

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.050
I will therefore multiply both
sides of the equation by A

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.870
inverse.

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.460
How do I know I could
multiply by A inverse?

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.330
Well, all I need to know
is that A inverse exists.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.580
But how do I know then
that A inverse does exist?

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.740
Well, I said that
A is non-singular

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.440
and by definition that
means that A inverse exists.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.300
So I multiply both
sides by A inverse.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.330
Now, I also know that
multiplication is associative.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.210
That's one of my
rules of the game.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.890
So I switch the voice
inflection, the parentheses.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.840
In other words, the
fact that this is true

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.450
means that this is true.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.470
See, I just switched
the voice inflection.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.210
But by definition, what
property does A inverse have?

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.600
It has the property that
A inverse multiplied by A

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.310
gives you the identity
matrix, I sub n.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:58.290
In other words,
from this statement

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:03.340
I can conclude that I sub n
times B equals I sub n times C.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.520
But what property
does I sub n have?

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.040
It has the property that when
it multiplies any matrix,

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.870
it does not change that matrix.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:12.060
Therefore I sub
n times B is just

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.510
B. I sub n times C is just
C. And I've concluded what?

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.930
That, as a theorem, it follows
inescapably in other words,

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.350
that if A is non-singular,
then if A*B equals A*C,

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:29.190
B must equal C. And this is step
by step the same proof that we

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.410
used for numbers, except
that we had to use what?

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.340
I sub n instead of 1.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.030
If we just recopy
this, this is what?

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.330
Structurally, we cannot
distinguish the proof here from

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:44.240
the proof that we gave
in numerical arithmetic.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.770
Now the question
that comes up is,

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.560
how do you determine whether a
matrix is non-singular or not?

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.490
Are there any cute recipes.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.050
And we've already, in this
course, for different reasons,

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.670
talked about 2 by 2 determinants
and 3 by 3 determinants.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:02.320
Determinants get messy when you
go up to higher than 3 by 3.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.910
Worse then messy,
they become deceptive

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.800
because the obvious recipes
turn out to be false.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.389
And the correct recipes
turn out to be ones

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:13.219
that you rebel against using
because somehow you're not

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:15.030
used to them and like
to believe there's

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.730
a simpler way of doing it.

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.199
I am going to save the
precise study of determinants

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.739
for a later block of material.

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.590
But I just want to mention
one interesting thing in terms

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.699
of determinants and why
determinants come up

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.920
in the studies of systems
of linear equations.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.780
And that is, the
role of determinants

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.080
is this-- and more
details will be supplied

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.870
in a later block-- the
matrix A is non-singular if

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.880
and only if its
determinant is not 0.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.960
In other words, the
existence of A inversed

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.900
is equivalent to the fact that
the determinant of the given

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.020
matrix is not 0.

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.750
Now this is a messy proof.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.780
So I will restrict the proof
to that case when n equals 2.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.470
Because in the case
n equals 2, it's

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.940
rather easy to multiply
these matrices together.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:04.236
For example, let's suppose I
take the matrix [a, b; c, d].

00:35:04.236 --> 00:35:06.110
In other words, we'll
call this the matrix A.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.790
And I want to see, what should
I multiply that matrix by

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.080
to get the identity matrix?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.925
In other words, under
what conditions can

00:35:11.925 --> 00:35:14.650
I invert the matrix
[a, b; c,  d]?

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:19.690
Well, what that means is I want
to find [x 1, x2; y 1, y 2]

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.460
such that when I multiply
these two matrices together,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.930
I get this matrix.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:25.490
Now, notice what this leads to.

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.240
For example, this
times this is what?

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:34.240
It's a*x_1 plus b*y_1,
but that must equal 1.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:40.630
Similarly, this times
this is c*x_1 plus d*y_1,

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.830
and that must equal
this, which is 0.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.630
And that means what?

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.640
To find x_1 and y_1, I have
to be able to solve the system

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:53.280
of equations a*x_1
plus b*y_1 equals 1.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.460
c*x_1 plus d*y_1 equals 0.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.960
Oh, similarly, it
also has to be true

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.090
that when I multiply the first
row by the second column,

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.600
I have to get 0.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.400
The second row here by
the second column here,

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.580
I have to get 1.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.960
That also gives me this
system of equations.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.090
Notice by the way, that
the matrix of coefficients

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:15.940
on both of these two
systems is the same.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:18.240
The matrix of
coefficients is what?

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.360
In both cases, the matrix of
coefficients is [a, b; c, d].

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.390
Now here's the point.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:28.530
In order to get a unique
solution here-- remember,

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.320
both of these two equations,
each of these two equations

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.650
represents the equation
of a straight line.

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.677
The only way you can get
one and only one solution

00:36:36.677 --> 00:36:38.510
is when the straight
lines are not parallel.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.920
You see, if the two
straight lines are parallel,

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.420
if they're different
straight lines,

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.850
there are no intersections.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.590
And if they happen
to coincide, you

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.060
have infinitely
many intersections.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.720
So the only time
you're in trouble here

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.100
is if these two lines
happen to be parallel.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.070
Algebraically, that says what?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.460
That the ratio b over a is the
same as the ratio d over c.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.320
In other words, the
unique solubility

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.550
of these systems of equations
requires only that b over a

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.360
be unequal to d over c.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.700
Well, another way of
saying that is what?

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.910
That a times d minus b
times c be unequal to 0.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.240
But what is a*d minus b*c?

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:27.070
a*d minus b*c is the determinant
of the matrix [a, b; c, d].

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.000
In other words, in
the two by two case,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.780
the matrix is
invertible if and only

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.650
if its determinant of
coefficients is not 0.

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:37.940
At least that proves it
for the two by two case.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.320
Let's check it out in
a couple of examples.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.680
Let's go back again to our old
friend from examples 2 and 3.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.050
Let A be the matrix
[1, 2; 2,  4].

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.670
The determinant of
coefficients is 1 times

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.820
4, which is 4, minus 2
times 2, which is also 4.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.680
4 minus 4 is 0.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.600
The determinant A is 0.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:03.550
Therefore, according to
our theorem A is singular.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.680
By the way, I guess
I've slipped here.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.570
I haven't defined
what singular means.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.100
I think it's rather obvious.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.120
Singular is an abbreviation
for non-non-singular.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.250
In other words, if it's
false that the matrix is

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.540
non-singular, then
we call it singular.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.050
In other words, A does
not have an inverse

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.190
because its determinant is 0.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.500
And this checks with
our previous result

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:31.080
when we showed that A
inverse didn't exist.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.780
OK.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.920
Let me pick one more example to
conclude today's lesson with.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.230
Let's take the
matrix A now to be

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.910
the matrix whose first row is
[5, 4] and whose second row

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:43.960
is [7, 6].

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.880
Then, how do we find
the determinant again?

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:51.700
It's 5 times 6, which is 30,
minus 7 times 4, which is 28.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.060
30 minus 28.

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.210
Well, it happens to be 2.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.580
But the key factor
is that it's not 0.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.840
In other words, the
determinant of A is not 0.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.240
Therefore, according
to our general theory,

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.970
A inverse exists.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:07.830
And now, we come to why I
have to give a second lecture

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.980
on this particular topic.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:11.250
You see, what I
have done now is I

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.650
have finished matrix algebra as
far as the qualitative overview

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.650
is concerned.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.680
But the major problem in
working with matrices,

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.970
and the one which I will solve
next time, is the following.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.230
If I'm given a matrix
A, and I know somehow

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.190
or other the
determinant is not 0,

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:35.420
or equivalently, somebody tells
me that the A inverse exists,

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.940
the question is, knowing
that A inverse exists,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:44.020
how do we actually determine
the value of A inverse?

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.560
You see, there's
two problems here.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.230
One is, given a
system of equations,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.550
say you have n equations with
n unknowns where y_1 up to y_n

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.300
are expressed in terms of x_1 up
to x_n, the first question is,

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.630
is it possible to solve for
the x's in terms of the y's.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:06.850
Now, if the answer to that
question is no, we quit.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.500
But if the answer is
yes, the next question--

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.300
and from a practical
point of view

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.720
this is often crucial--
the next question is,

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.240
knowing that we can solve for
the x's in terms of the y's,

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.700
how do we actually carry
out this computation?

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.530
And the matrix
equivalence is this.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:26.300
Given the matrix A, A
inverse need not exist.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.500
But if A inverse does
exist, how do we compute it?

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.970
And that will be the subject
of our lecture next time,

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:36.730
how to compute A inverse.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.210
And a corollary to
this will be, how

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.040
is this related to
solutions of systems of n

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.990
equations in n unknowns?

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.480
But we'll talk more
about that next time.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.190
And until next time, good bye.
