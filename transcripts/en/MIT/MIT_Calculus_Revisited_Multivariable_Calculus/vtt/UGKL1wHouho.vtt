00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.820
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.370
Today, we would like to
begin our study of calculus

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.360
of several real variables.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.890
And as I mentioned
in our last lecture,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.400
I would like to begin it from
the traditional point of view.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.140
And I guess I'd like to make
a little bit of a short speech

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.700
even before we begin.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.360
There may be a
little bit of danger

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.320
in the way I've been
emphasizing the modern approach

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.190
to mathematics: that
one may actually believe

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.400
that the traditional
approach to mathematics

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.290
left very, very
much to be desired.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.150
The answer is, it didn't really.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.870
That the role of logic in
good traditional mathematics

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.410
was about the same as it is
in good modern mathematics.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.820
That in fact, if we
define new mathematics

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.240
as meaning meaningful
mathematics,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.970
there really was no difference
between the two approaches.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.520
Except for the
fact that after you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.040
have a couple of hundred
years of hindsight

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.740
and can take a subject apart
from a different point of view,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.080
then obviously it's
no great surprise

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
that you can find cleaner ways
of really presenting the topic.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.050
It's the old cliche of hindsight
being better than foresight

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.280
by a darn sight,
or some such thing.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.650
But at any rate,
without further ado,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.760
let's actually look
at the introduction

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.250
to calculus of
several real variables

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.780
from a traditional
point of view.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.900
And I've abbreviated
that title to simply

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.070
say, "Calculus of
Several Variables."

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.610
Whereas I say that,
think of two things.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.430
First of all, it's
an introduction.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.900
And second of all, we're
going to be doing this

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.330
from the traditional
point of view.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.060
Now, what we're
assuming is-- remember,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.380
last time we talked
about functions

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.780
of several real variables.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.050
We talked about
the limit concept,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.730
gave you exercises that drilled
you on what limits meant,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.960
and the like.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.130
And as a result,
it now makes sense

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.229
to talk about the calculus, the
instantaneous rate of change.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.520
Except that you have an awful
lot of variables in here.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.590
In other words, the general
case that we'd like to tackle

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.920
is the case where we have
w being some real number,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.050
being a function of the
n independent variables

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.300
x_1 up to x_n.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.230
And of course, you see, the
calculus applies to the f.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.920
The w used here is to indicate
the fact that the output is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.640
a real number.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.960
It's like talking about f
of x versus y equals f of x.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.400
In a manner of speaking, it's
the f of x that's important.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.180
We won't get into
that right now.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.890
What was important, though,
about y equals f of x?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.410
It indicated a graph-- graph.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.610
And because it was a graph,
we could visualize things

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.590
pictorially that
might have been harder

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.610
to understand analytically.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.810
For this reason, even though
n may be any positive integer

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.570
whatsoever-- preferably,
of course, greater than 1,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.117
otherwise we wouldn't have a
function of several variables.

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.950
In fact, that's the
definition of a function

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.970
of several variables--
it's an expression

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.290
of this type where
n is greater than 1.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.580
But in general, and you'll
notice this in the text

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.470
as well, we begin with the
special case that n equals 2.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.790
Because, you see, if
n is 2, we need what?

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.250
Two degrees of freedom to plot
the independent variables.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.730
That would be the
xy-plane, for example.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.360
A third degree of
freedom, say, the z-axis,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.490
often called w-axis
because of the symbolism.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.210
In other words, in
the same way that I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.230
could graph a
real-valued function

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.700
of a single real variable
as a curve in the plane,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.620
I can graph a real-valued
function of two real variables

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.370
as a surface in
three-dimensional space.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.329
And as a result, when one is
adjusting to new language,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.760
it's nice to take the case n
equals 2 simply because you

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.880
can view things pictorially.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.960
The danger, of course,
with n equals 2,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.970
is you get so used to the
picture that after a while

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.980
you forget that n could
have been more than 2.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.950
So I will try to pay homage
to both points of view.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.310
I will simply mention here that
we will often let n equal 2

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.400
to take advantage of geometry.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.070
When we do this,
the usual notation

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.370
is to let w equal f of x, y
where x and y are independent.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.280
And I should mention why
it's so important to talk

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.590
about independent variables.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.130
It'll become clear in a moment.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.540
Let me just tell you what
independent means, and then

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.340
I'll show you why it
becomes clear in a moment.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.370
To say that x and
y are independent

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.880
simply means that you can
choose one of the two variables

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.760
without determining the other.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.150
For example, if I were
to say let y equal 2x,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.620
then certainly y and
x are not independent,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.790
because the choice of x
determines the choice of y.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.930
But to say that x and
y are independent--

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.110
and that's what we mean by
two degrees of freedom--

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.670
is I can take any
value of x that I want

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.170
and not be impeded as to
the choice of y that I want.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.615
And that's why we say the
domain is the xy-plane.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:33.865
I have two degrees of freedom.

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.390
I can roam anywhere
through the plane this way.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.720
But the reason that we
want this is as follows.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.130
And this is where the
traditional mathematics

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.220
was every bit as logical
as the modern mathematics.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.350
Let's keep in mind
that logic is the art

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.630
of taking known situations that
we know how to handle, you see,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.390
and reducing unfamiliar
situations to these more

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.920
familiar situations.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.590
The point is that even in
traditional mathematics,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.330
one knew how to
handle the calculus

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.210
of a single real variable.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.060
So what one said was
this, given that w

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.000
is a function of both x
and y, let's hold y fixed,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.050
for example, and let x vary.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.940
You see, if I fix y at
some particular value

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.230
and let x vary, once I've
made that fixed choice of y,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.090
I have w as a
function of x alone.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.880
And as long as w is a
function of x alone,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.020
I already know how to
take the derivative of w

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.300
with respect to x.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.890
And by the way,
there's no favoritism

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.360
here between x and y.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.330
In a similar way, if I hold
x constant and let y vary,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.940
then w is a function of y alone.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.780
And I can then find
the derivative of w

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.240
with respect to y.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.360
And these things were called
partial derivatives, you see,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.480
because it involved
holding what?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.750
All but one of the
variables constant.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.190
We'll go into that in more
detail as we go along.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.500
But the whole idea is what?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.090
By choosing the variables
to be independent,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.820
we can hold all of them
but one at a time constant.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.990
And as long as we're doing
that, the resulting function

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.350
is a function of a
single real variable.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.980
And this reduces us to
part one of our course.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.730
So at any rate, what
we're saying is,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.790
fix y at some constant
value, say, y equals y sub 0.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.360
And we then let x vary as
in ordinary one-dimensional

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.110
calculus between x_0 minus the
magnitude of delta x and x_0

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.760
plus the magnitude of delta x.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.670
In other words, we mark off an
interval of magnitude delta x,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.540
on either side of x_0 and
let x be any place in here.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.760
Then what we do, is remembering
that y0 is a constant,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.760
and that this function, no
matter how complicated it looks

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.720
like, is a function of
just delta x alone, we

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.880
mimic the definition of
an ordinary derivative.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.740
In other words, we
take the limit as delta

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.900
x approaches 0 of f of x_0
plus delta x comma y_0,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.340
minus f of x_0 comma y_0,
and divide that by delta x.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.490
In other words, with y_0
being treated as a constant,

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.960
notice that essentially,
this is the change

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.250
in f as x varies between
x_0 and x_0 plus delta

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.630
x, divided by the change in x.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.610
In other words, it's the
limit of an average rate

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.590
of change of f of x with respect
to x for a fixed value of y_0.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:34.070
And to indicate that, we
write this analogously,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.320
I would say, to how
we write functions

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.870
of a single real variable.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.299
In other words,
we write f prime.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.914
Instead of f prime,
we indicate--

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:45.780
let me put it this way, when
you had only one real variable,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.575
was there any danger of
misinterpreting the prime?

00:08:48.575 --> 00:08:50.700
After all, with only one
independent variable, when

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.180
you said derivative,
it was obvious what

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.740
variable you were
differentiating

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.890
with respect to.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.190
Here, there are two
variables, x and y.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.360
So instead of the
prime as a subscript,

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.430
we write down the variable
with respect to which

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.699
we're taking the derivative.

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:05.990
And then we put in the point
at which the derivative is

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:07.520
being evaluated.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.560
You see, in a
similar way, to have

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.360
defined f sub y of x_0, y_0,
that would have meant what?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.440
We hold x constant
at some value x_0,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.110
let y vary between y_0
and y_0 plus delta y,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.870
and take the limit of this
expression, f of x_0 comma y_0

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.770
plus delta y minus f of
x_0, y_0, over delta y.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.300
Take the limit of
that expression

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.460
as delta y approaches
0, you see.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.840
And we're going to show
this pictorially in a while.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.960
After all, that's why we
chose the case n equals 2,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.240
was so that we could eventually
illustrate this thing

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.560
pictorially.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.870
But for the time being, I prefer
not to introduce the picture

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.460
because I want you
to see that even

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.830
in the case where my input
consists of an n-tuple where

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.000
n is greater than
2, or 3, or 4--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.560
whatever you want-- that
this thing still makes sense.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.560
In other words, in
general, suppose w

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.430
is a function of the n
independent variables

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.670
x sub 1 up to x sub n.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.060
And I want to compute f of
x sub 1 at the point x_1

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.600
equals a_1, et cetera,
x_n equals a_n.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:22.650
By definition, what I do is I
hold a_2 up to a_n constant.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.920
I let x_1 vary from a_1
to a_1 plus delta x.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.120
I compute what?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.700
f of a_1 plus delta x comma
a_2, et cetera, comma a_n,

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.370
minus f of a_1 up to a_n.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:43.700
Noticing that that numerator is
simply the change in f as x_1

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.690
varies from a_1 to
a_1 plus delta x_1

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.230
while all the other variables
are being held constant.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.580
Which of course I can do if
the variables are independent.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.740
I then divide that by delta x_1.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.490
That's the average
rate of change.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.660
Then I take the limit as
delta x_1 approaches 0.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.230
And this I can do for
any number of variables,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.100
provided that
they're independent.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.190
Keep that in mind, if x sub
n could be expressed in terms

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:13.900
of the remaining x's, how
can I hold a sub n constant--

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.880
or, how can I vary a sub n while
I hold the other ones constant?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.920
In other words, if the a_n's--
if one of variables depends

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.160
on the others, they are related
in terms of their motion.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.010
Keep in mind here, I
just chose delta x_1.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.090
Analogous definition is
held for f sub x sub 2,

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.870
f sub x sub 3, et cetera.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.290
OK?

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:39.800
I think again that once
you see a few examples,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.220
the mystery vanishes.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.560
What this thing says
in plain English

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.500
is that when you have a
function of several variables

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.500
and you want to take the
derivative with respect

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.105
to one of those
variables, pretend

00:11:51.105 --> 00:11:52.830
that every one of
the other variables

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.030
was being held constant.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.160
Let me give an example.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.280
Let w be f of x_1,
x_2, x_3, where

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.690
the specific f that I have in
mind is obtained as follows.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:08.020
It's x_1 times x_2 times
x_3 plus e to the x_1 power.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.310
Now, to take the derivative
of this with respect to x_1,

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.150
all that this says
is treat x_2 and x_3

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.600
as if they were constants.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.740
Well, look at it.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.370
If I treat x_2 and x_3 as
if they were constants,

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.980
if I differentiate this with
respect to x_1, all I have left

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.000
is what?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.350
This particular constant,
which is x_2 times x_3.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.250
And the derivative of e to
the x_1, with respect to x_1,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.250
is e to the x_1.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:38.060
Therefore, f sub x_1 in
this case is x_2*x_3 plus e

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.220
to the x_1.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.310
In particular, if I evaluate f
sub x sub 1 at the three-tuple

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:49.740
(1, 2, 3)-- namely, I replace
x_1 by 1, x_2 by 2, x_3 by 3--

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.950
I obtain what?

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.400
2 times 3 plus e
to the first power.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.010
In other words, this is
just a number, 6 plus e.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.160
On the other hand,
if I had decided

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.860
to differentiate this
with respect to x_2,

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.780
I would've treated x_1
and x_3 as constants.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.060
With x_1 and x_3 as constants,
the derivative of this with

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.370
respect to x_2 is just x_1*x_3.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.110
Treating x_1 as a constant,
the derivative of e

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:20.160
to the x_1 with respect
to the variable x_3 is 0.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.220
Because the derivative
of any constant is 0.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.450
Notice that this is
not really a constant.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.150
It's a constant
once I've fixed x_1

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:31.120
at a particular value, which is
what this particular definition

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.180
says.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:39.360
In particular, f sub x sub 2 of
(1, 2, 3) is 1 times 3, or 3.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.830
I should also mention
that sometimes instead

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.060
of writing f of x sub
1, we write something

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.850
that looks like the
regular derivative,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.510
only we make a funny
kind of script d instead

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.870
of an ordinary d.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.700
This is read "the
partial derivative

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.330
of w with respect to x_1."

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.140
And the relationship
between these two notations

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.990
is rather similar to
the relationship that

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.900
exists between the notations
dy/dx and f prime of x.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.680
At any rate, if we have the n
independent variables x_1 up

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.040
to x_n, and f is a function
of those variables,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.770
f sub x sub 1, et
cetera, f sub x sub n

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:23.010
are called the partial
derivatives of f with respect

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.950
to x_1 up to x_n, respectively.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.860
In other words, this means what?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.630
The partial derivative
of f with respect to x_1.

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.560
That means what?

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.660
Take the ordinary derivative as
if x_1 were the only variable.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.580
This is the partial of f
with respect to x sub n.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.090
That means take the
ordinary derivative of f

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.460
as if x sub n were
the only variable.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.960
And you can always do this,
provided that your variables

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.660
are independent.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.490
Because our
definitions so closely

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.169
parallel the structure
for what happened

00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:57.710
in the case of one independent
variable-- including the limit

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.090
theorems, the distance
formulas, and what have you--

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.800
it turns out that the usual
derivative properties still

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.550
hold.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.100
For example, if w happens to
be the function of the two

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.020
independent variables e to
the 3x plus y times sine 2x

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.620
minus y, and I want to take the
derivative of w with respect

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.400
to x-- meaning differentiate
this treating y

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.930
as a constant-- notice the
treating y as a constant

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.490
gives me two functions of what?

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.990
x.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.800
In other words, my
function is a product

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.650
of two functions, each
of which depends on x.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.710
So I use the ordinary product
rule to differentiate this.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.740
Namely, how do I use the product
rule to take the partial of w

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.840
with respect to x?

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.820
I treat y as a constant
and I differentiate

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.440
as if x is the only variable.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.320
I say what?

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.070
It's the first factor,
e to the 3x plus y times

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.280
the derivative of the
second with respect to x,

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:54.020
treating y as a constant.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.960
If I treat y as a
constant, the derivative

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.080
of sine of 2x minus y is
cosine 2x minus y times

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.820
the derivative of what's
inside with respect to x.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.370
And that's just 2.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.340
Plus what?

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.290
The second term times the
derivative of the first.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.900
And the derivative
of e to the 3x plus y

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.070
with respect to x,
treating y as a constant,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.610
is e to the 3x plus y times
the derivative of 3x plus y,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.130
with respect to x,
which is just 3.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.990
And so I have the partial
of w with respect to x.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.410
In a similar way, I could
have found the partial of w

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.590
with respect to y, et cetera.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.870
I should now introduce
one little problem

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.671
that will bother you, maybe
even after I help you with this.

00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:43.170
In fact, I guess
what really crushes

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.251
me is the student who comes up
in a live class, after class,

00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:48.750
and says, "I understood it until
I heard you lecture on it."

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.980
I hope this doesn't
cause that problem.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.590
But the danger is, I tell
you, lookit, everything

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.990
that happened for calculus
of a single variable

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.750
happens for calculus
of several variables.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.880
Then all of a sudden,
you'll find in our textbook,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.970
in every textbook,
just about, they'll

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.849
say things like, if you take
the partial of the variable u

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:09.230
with respect to
x, you do not get

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.470
the reciprocal of the partial
of x with respect to u.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:17.869
In other words, remember, for
one variable, dy/dx, right,

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:21.220
was the reciprocal of dx/dy.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.369
They say it's not true
in several variables.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.980
I have written in an
accentuated question mark

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.050
here because I want
to explain something

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.400
very important to you.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.370
And by the way, if
you understand this,

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.380
you're 90% of the way
home free as far as

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.850
understanding how calculus
of several variables

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.410
is used in most
important applications.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.180
Let me take a very simple case.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:46.790
Let u equal x plus y, and
let v equal x minus y,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.280
Now obviously, if u equals
x plus y, the partial of u

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.300
with respect to x, if
we hold y constant--

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.940
we treat x as the
only variable-- is 1.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:55.440
Right?

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.160
The partial of u with
respect to x is 1.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.030
On the other hand, notice that
if I add these two equations,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.930
the y term drops out.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.220
I get what?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.110
2x equals u plus v,
divide through by 2.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:15.320
That says x is equal
to 1/2*u plus 1/2*v.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.820
Let me now take the
partial of x with respect

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.110
to u, holding v
constant, treating u

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.500
as the only variable.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.710
It's easy for me to see that the
partial of x with respect to u

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.880
is 1/2.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.840
And certainly, if I
now compare these two,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.490
it should be clear that this
is not the reciprocal of this,

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.322
or vice versa.

00:18:36.322 --> 00:18:37.780
The point that I
wanted to mention,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.120
though, was the following.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.900
That when, here, we said,
take the partial of u

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.830
with respect to x,
we were assuming

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:50.320
that the independent
variables were x and y.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.700
And when we said, here, take
the partial of x with respect

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.760
to u, what did we hold constant?

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.210
We held v constant.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.300
In other words-- I'm not going
to keep this habit up very

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:01.910
long.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.970
But just for the
time being, I would

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:07.790
like you to get used to the idea
of putting in as a subscript

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.410
the variables that are
being held constant.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.950
You see, in the
textbook when they

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.990
say this is the case,
what they really

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:18.040
mean is, if you
differentiate u with respect

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.200
to x, holding y constant,
that in general will not

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.520
be the reciprocal of the
derivative of x with respect

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.870
to u, holding v constant.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.769
So I can cross out
the question mark now.

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:32.060
But the point is, notice that
the variables that you're

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.560
holding constant
here are different.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.710
You see, suppose instead I took
the partial of x with respect

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.570
to u, holding y constant.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.920
In other words, suppose I solve
for x in terms of u and y.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.580
That happens to be
very easy to do here.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.970
Given that u equals x plus
y, it follows immediately

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.550
that x is equal to u minus y.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.870
Now, if I take the partial
of x with respect to u,

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.420
treating y as a
constant-- so let

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.760
me do that-- what do
I get for an answer?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.330
I get 1 for an answer.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.900
In other words, the
reciprocal of the partial

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.360
of x with respect to u,
treating y as a constant--

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.180
as the other
independent variable--

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.120
is equal to the partial
of u with respect

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.820
to x when it's also y
that's being considered

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.320
as the other variable.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.110
When the variables outside here
match up, the recipes work.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.710
Of course that leads
to the question,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.740
then why do the textbooks
tell you that this isn't true?

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.910
Why do they pick this particular
representation rather than

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.990
this one?

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.000
And I have a combination
example and explanation here.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.160
And it's simply this.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.920
Let's suppose I was given that
w equals e to the x plus y times

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.260
cosine x minus y.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.860
It seems that since the only
way the variable appears

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.900
in the first factor
is as x plus y,

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.010
and the only way it appears
in the second factor

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.630
is in the form x minus y,
a very natural substitution

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:05.200
might be to say that u equal x
plus y and v equal x minus y.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.410
In other words, I could
either visualize w

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.350
as being a function of
x and y-- in which case,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.060
it would be e to the x plus
y times cosine x minus y--

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.825
or, I could visualize w as being
a simpler function of the two

00:21:19.825 --> 00:21:24.355
new variables u and v,
where w is then just what? e

00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:26.370
to the u times cosine v.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.000
Notice again, that
this formula here

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.300
is much simpler than this one.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.510
This one says what?

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:34.750
Take e to of the
sum of these two,

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.010
multiplied by the cosine of
the difference of these two.

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.540
And this one just says what?

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.990
Take e to the first times
the cosine of the second.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.440
But the point is, that you might
make this change of variables

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.660
to simplify your computations.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.970
The point is that
either we would treat w

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:56.620
as a function of x and y,
or we would have treated w

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.280
as a function of u and v.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.420
And by the way, notice
here my use of f and g.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.570
Notice that w is a different
function of x and y

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.770
than it is of u and v. But
this notation says what?

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.730
We can consider w either
in terms of x and y,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.320
or in terms of u and v. Hardly
ever would we consider w

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.630
as a function of u and y.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.770
In other words, either we would
change the variables or we

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.610
don't.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.890
Or, for example, in terms
of polar versus Cartesian

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.740
coordinates, either we use x
and y or we use r and theta.

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.040
We don't usually use r and x.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.240
In other words, going back to
the textbook example again,

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.510
if we look at this
particular situation here,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.600
all the book is
saying is, when you're

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.480
differentiating
with respect to n,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.310
you usually mean that y is the
variable being held constant.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.275
When we differentiate
with respect to u,

00:22:46.275 --> 00:22:49.120
we usually means that v
is the variable that's

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.370
being held constant.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:54.020
Again, more of this is
said in our exercises.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.790
But for the time
being, I want you

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.930
to see how important it is,
when you have several variables,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.820
to keep track of which are
the dependent variables, which

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.500
are the independent variables,
and how they're coupled.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.490
I said earlier that one of the
nice things about picking n

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.760
equals 2 is that you can draw a
nice picture of the situation.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.340
And what I thought you might
like to see is the following.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.310
Let's suppose you have that w
is some function of x and y.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.420
What that means is, we can
locate-- for a given value of x

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.580
and a given value of y.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:28.170
In other words, for x
equals x_0, y equals y_0,

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.800
we can think of the point (x_0,
y_0) as being in the xy-plane.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.050
w, which is f of x_0,
y_0, is just the height

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.930
to this particular surface.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:46.200
In other words, if I let f
of x_0, y_0 be called w_0,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:51.670
notice that the function f of
x, y, at the point x equals x_0,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.940
y equals y_0, graphically
corresponds to the point

00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:01.060
whose coordinates are
x_0, y_0, and w_0.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.530
OK?

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:03.790
This is now a surface.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.600
And in the same way that we use
tangent lines to replace curves

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.260
when we had one independent
variable, in two

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.340
independent variables,
we use tangent planes

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:16.920
to replace surfaces.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.190
The question that comes up is,
how do you get a tangent plane?

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.000
And what does this have to do
with the partial derivatives?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
And what I would like
show you is the following.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.640
First of all, one
very natural way

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.390
of intersecting this surface
with a plane-- in other words,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.330
when you take the
partial of w with respect

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.330
to y, you're holding x constant,
you're saying, let x equal x_0.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.340
Notice that in three-dimensional
space, x equals x_0

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.550
is the equation of this plane.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:51.380
And this plane-- see, what
is it the plane x equals x_0?

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.710
It's the plane that goes
through the line x equals

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.540
x_0 parallel to the xy-plane.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.327
This plane intersects my
surface in a particular curve.

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:06.150
That curve passes through P_0.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.340
I can talk about the
slope of the curve

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.620
at that particular point.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:12.500
OK?

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.620
In a similar way, I
could've sliced the surface

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.540
by the plane y equals y_0.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.620
In other words, hold y constant.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.710
Well, you see, to
hold y constant, that

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.850
means I, again, draw my plane.

00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:32.330
It intersects the surface
in a different curve,

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.630
but that curve must also
go through the point P_0.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.930
That's the same P_0
that's over here,

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.880
because after all, the point
on the surface that is directly

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.704
above (x_0, y_0) is P_0.

00:25:44.704 --> 00:25:46.370
And that point doesn't
change, no matter

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.460
what plane you slice
this thing with.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.530
OK?

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:53.710
And so again, I can talk
about the slope of the tangent

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.160
to this particular
curve of intersection.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.070
By the way, one very brief aside
before I continue on with this.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.180
One of the things that makes
functions of several variables

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.170
so difficult is-- I would
like you to observe,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.190
because this will
become the backbone

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.870
of our future investigations--
that these two

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.740
particular planes that I
drew, to intersect my surface,

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.570
were very special planes.

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.720
One of them was
parallel-- they both

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.890
went through the
point (x_0, y_0),

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.470
but one happened to be
parallel to the wy-plane

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.300
and the other one happened to
be parallel to the wx-plane.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.310
Notice that, in
general, I could have

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.530
passed infinitely many different
planes through (x_0, y_0).

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.610
Each of which would have
intersected the surface

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.020
in a different curve.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.540
And this is what leads later
to the more generalized concept

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.530
of directional derivatives
that we will talk about in more

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.800
detail in our future lectures.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.930
But I simply
mention the word now

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.340
because in the reading
material in this assignment,

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.310
some mention is made of
directional derivatives.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.690
In other words, I
wanted to point out

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.670
that to take
partial derivatives,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.630
we are interested in
two special directions,

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:08.557
even though there
are other directions.

00:27:08.557 --> 00:27:10.140
The question that
comes up, of course,

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.180
is where do the
partials come in here?

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:19.370
And secondly, knowing where
partials come up in here, how

00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.590
do we find the equation
of a tangent plane?

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.300
And all I would like
you to see from here

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.820
is that I'm going to use the
same old technique as always.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.820
Given these two tangent lines,
I'm going to vectorize them.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.460
I am then going to find the
equation of a plane that passes

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.130
through those two vectors.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.310
To do that, I'm
going to have to find

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.971
the normal to that
plane, et cetera.

00:27:41.971 --> 00:27:43.720
And I'm going to wind
up with the equation

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.030
of a tangent plane.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.900
In more slow motion,
all I'm saying

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.690
is if I now take this picture
and draw it over here-- notice

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.070
the representation-- it looks
as if the curve that I get

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.950
is in the wy-plane.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:57.710
It's actually in
a plane parallel

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.240
to the wy-plane characterized
by x equals x sub 0.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.610
And by the way,
notice even though x

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:09.060
equals x_0 was chosen
so that x_0 was fixed,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.970
I hope it's clear to you that if
I let x sub 0 vary and I picked

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.420
different values of x sub
0, the curve that I get here

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.680
will, in general, differ.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.400
You see, what I'm
saying is, if I

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.740
take slices parallel
to the wy-plane

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.970
for a particular
surface, the slices

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.930
that I get-- the shape--
will depend on what

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.380
the particular value of x_0 is.

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.990
But that's not the
crucial issue right now.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.760
The point that
I'm driving at is,

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:41.650
if I if I vectorize the
tangent line and call that v_1,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.610
what does that tangent
line look like?

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.405
First of all, let's
see what its slope is.

00:28:47.405 --> 00:28:50.910
Now again, if you didn't
see this over here

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.310
and all I showed
was this diagram,

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.840
you would say, hey, that
slope is just the derivative

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.240
of w with respect to y.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.050
But we write that the
partial of w with respect

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.020
to y in deference to the fact
that w is not a function of y

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.320
alone-- that w depends
on both x and y,

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.350
and the reason that we got
this curve was that we fixed

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.770
x at some particular value.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.060
So this is really what?

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.510
Not the derivative of w with
respect to y evaluated at y

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.890
equals y_0.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:25.795
It's the partial of w with
respect to y evaluated at what?

00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:28.980
x_0 comma y_0.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.340
All right, at any rate,
now that we have the slope,

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.240
notice that the
slope of a vector

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.700
can always be viewed
as the k component--

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.890
in this case, the k component
divided by the j component.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.760
If I make the j
component 1, the slope

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.720
will just be the k component.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.120
In other words,
a vector which is

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.930
tangent to the curve-- and one
that's easy to write down--

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.770
is j plus the partial of w
with respect to y, evaluated

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.340
at (x_0, y_0), times k.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:04.270
And notice, by the way,
that this is a number.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.010
That once I take the
partial derivative

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.224
and evaluate it at a
point, I have a number.

00:30:08.224 --> 00:30:08.890
So this is what?

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:12.470
A constant vector once
x_0 and y_0 are fixed.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:17.740
In a similar way, my vector v_2,
which is for my curve parallel

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:23.690
to the wx-plane-- the slope
of that curve at the point P_0

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.300
is not dw/dx, it's the
partial of w with respect

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.340
to x, evaluated (x_0, y_0).

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.440
Again, why?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.830
Because, even though this looks
like w is a function of x alone

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.450
here, it was only
that way because we

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.500
took the second variable
and, in a sense,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.990
froze it at the value y_0.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.450
At any rate, in an
analogous manner,

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.080
v_2 turns out to be what vector?

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.450
It's i plus the partial
of w with respect

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.760
to x evaluated
(x_0, y_0) times k.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:57.090
In other words, the slope is the
partial of w with respect to x.

00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:59.005
And it's in the ik-plane.

00:30:59.005 --> 00:31:01.460
In other words, the xw-plane.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.130
Now that I have my
two vectors, to find

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.310
the plane that passes through
them, all I need is what?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.460
The normal vector and
a point in the plane.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:14.240
Well, one of the nice
things about having studied

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.500
the cross product
here, is that I can now

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.250
take the cross product
of v_1 and v_2.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.710
Sparing you the details,
remember what I do here.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.580
I just write down i, j, k.
v_1 has these components,

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.490
v_2 has these components.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:34.050
I now expand this
determinant in the usual way.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.490
And I get what?

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.209
This particular vector.

00:31:37.209 --> 00:31:39.125
In other words, the i
component is the partial

00:31:39.125 --> 00:31:40.730
of w with respect to x.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.660
The j component is a partial
of w with respect to y.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:46.270
Both evaluated at
the point (x_0, y_0).

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.640
And the k component is minus 1.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.310
Now, to find the equation of a
tangent plane, all I have to do

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.750
is what?

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.550
Take the standard
form of the plane.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.910
In other words, the
coefficients will be these.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:03.950
And then I take (x_0, y_0, w_0),
which is a point in my plane.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:06.910
And then the equation
of the tangent plane

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.580
becomes, quite simply,
this expression here.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.290
And in fact, if I
rewrite that, notice

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.180
I can transpose the
w minus w_0 term.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.260
That is the change in w.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.920
But to remind us that
we're in the tangent plane,

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.830
we don't write this as delta w,
we write it as delta w sub tan.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.950
And notice that the change
in w to the tangent plane

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.380
is just the partial of w with
respect to x times delta x,

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.290
plus the partial of w with
respect to y times delta y.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.570
And hopefully, this starts
to seem familiar to you.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.310
This should almost look like
the equation of delta y tan,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.060
only in two dimensions.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.040
Remember when we had delta y
tan in part one of the course?

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.160
See, what this
really says is what?

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.390
This is the change in w with
respect to x, multiplied

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.050
by the total change in x.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.150
In other words,
this term is what?

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.380
It's the change in w due
to the change in x alone.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.450
This term is the change
in w, with respect to y,

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.510
times the total change in y.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.720
So this term tells
you the change

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.630
in w due to the
change in y alone.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.970
And if you add these two up,
since x and y are independent,

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.514
this should give you
the total change in w.

00:33:18.514 --> 00:33:20.930
The reason, of course, that
you don't get the total change

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.320
in w, but rather, delta
w tan, is the fact

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.160
that if these
expressions here are not

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.380
constant numbers as delta
x and delta y ore varying,

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.410
these numbers here are varying.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.800
These are variables.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.460
But you see, once you fix
these at these values,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.270
these become numbers, and now
you know what delta w tan is.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.640
Now, in some of the
homework problems

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.350
in the text, what
we're going to do

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.610
is just practice
the geometry itself.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.280
We're going to find
equations of tangent planes.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.430
The thing that's very important
to us in future lectures,

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.810
from a structural
point of view, is

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.320
that the equation of the
tangent plane-- in other words,

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.040
the equation for delta
w tan-- is far more

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.260
simple to handle than the
equation for the true delta w.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:11.350
You see, the equation
for delta w tan

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:15.020
just has delta x and delta y
appearing to the first power.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.929
Whereas, if you try to
find delta w exactly

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.210
for an arbitrary
function of x and y,

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.840
this can become a
very, very messy thing.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.980
In short, delta w
tan will play for two

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.210
and more independent
variables the same role

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.620
that delta y sub
tan played for us

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.360
in part one of this
course as a differential.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.280
And what we'll be
discussing next, or at least

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.810
trying to get at
the root of, is just

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.170
what does play the
role of a differential

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.170
when you're dealing with
calculus of several variables?

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:51.889
And what we're going to find is
that, again, the computations

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:55.100
become messy enough so that
even though the structure stays

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.070
fairly nice, there are
some wrinkles that come up

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.830
that will take us a considerable
amount of time to untangle.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:04.620
But we'll worry about
that when the time comes.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.560
And so until that time, goodbye.
