00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.850
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.060
Today we do a somewhat
computational bit.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.240
And actually, the
lecture for today

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.680
is not nearly as
difficult, once you

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.320
get through the
maze of symbolism,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.940
as it is to apply the material.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.320
In other words, we're going
to devote the next two

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.190
units of our course to this
particular topic, which

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.060
is known as the chain rule.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.870
But we'll give one lecture
to cover both units.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.100
And again, the idea is
that it's not so much

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.780
that the concept becomes
more difficult as much as it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.820
is that you must
develop a certain amount

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.650
of dexterity keeping track of
the various partial derivatives

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.090
and the like.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330
At any rate, maybe
I think the best way

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.120
is to just barge into a
hypothetical situation

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.060
and see what the
situation really is.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.610
The idea is essentially
the following.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.150
We're given some
function, say, w.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.100
w is a function of, say, the
three independent variables

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.010
x, y, and z.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.020
Now, for some reason
or other, which

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.670
we won't worry
about right now, it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.880
turns out that x, y,
and z are, in turn,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.720
conveniently expressible in
terms of the two variables

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.915
r and s.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.980
In fact, if you want a physical
interpretation of this,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.260
you can think of if x,
y, and z are functions

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.050
of the two independent
variables r and s,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.780
that means that we have
two degrees of freedom.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.450
So we may think of this as
parametrically representing

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.930
the equation of a surface.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.840
And what we're
talking about here

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.010
is w being a function of
something in space and asking,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.900
what does w look like when
you restrict your space

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.300
to a particular surface?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.700
I mean, that's just a
geometrical interpretation

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.050
that one could talk about.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.350
But the idea is the following.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.730
After all, if w depends
on x, y, and z, and x, y,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.100
and z each depend on r
and s, in particular then,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.660
it's clear that w itself is
some function of r and s,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.500
where, again, I use
the usual notation

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.090
of using a g here
rather than the f

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.090
up here to indicate that the
relationship between r and s

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.900
which specifies w,
may very well be

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.930
a different algebraic
relationship than that which

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.820
relates x, y, and z to give w.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.750
But the point that we have
in mind is the following.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.750
Given that w is a
function of x, y,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.170
and z, given that x, y, and
z are functions of r and s,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.560
hence w is a
function of r and s.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.930
The question that we ask in
calculus of several variables

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.910
is, first of all, if we can
be sure that these were all

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.060
continuously
differentiable functions,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.190
can we be sure that w will be
a continuously differentiable

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.310
function of r and s?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.290
That's the first question.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.470
And the second question
is, OK, assuming

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.490
that the answer to the first
question is in the affirmative,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.890
that w is a continuously
differentiable function of r

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.110
and s, how could we compute,
for example, the partial of w

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.940
with respect to r, knowing
all of the so-called obvious

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.330
other partial derivatives?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.590
What do I mean by that?

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.240
Well, what I mean is if you were
to look just at this equation,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.960
just looking at
this equation, what

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.060
are the obvious partial
derivatives to take?

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.810
You say, well, we'll
take the partial of w

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.190
with respect to x, the partial
of w with respect to y,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.790
and the partial of
w with respect to z.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.180
And if you were to look,
say, at this equation,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.050
the natural thing to ask
is, what is the partial

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.350
of x with respect to r?

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.029
What is the partial of
x with respect to s?

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.010
Et cetera.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.830
In other words, what
we're saying is,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.580
in this particular problem, we
would like to figure out how,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.410
for example, to compute the
partial of w with respect

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.010
to r, knowing that we
have at our disposal

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.390
the partials of w with
respect to x, y, and z;

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.810
the partials of x, y, and z
with respect to r; et cetera;

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.950
meaning we also have
the partials of x, y,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.310
and z with respect to theta.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.370
Before I go any further,
notice, by the way,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.930
that if I left out that
phrase that we were talking

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.120
about in our last lecture,
"continuously differentiable,"

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.370
notice that all of
this would make sense,

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.330
provided that the
derivatives existed.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.010
There was no place here
do I make any statement

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.090
that the partials have to not
only exist but be continuous.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.270
I never say that at all.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.720
This is what the problem is.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.490
I would like to
use the chain rule.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.880
Do you see why it's
called the chain rule?

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.410
w is a function of x, y, and z.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.400
x, y, and z are each
functions of r and s.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.510
Now, what I claim is that
not only is it possible

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.830
to do this but the
recipe for doing

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.130
this is a very, very suggestive
thing, one which is very, very

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.930
easy to remember, once you
see how it's put together.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.590
If you don't see how
it's put together,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.580
the thing is just
a mess-- namely,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.351
the claim is that the partial
of w with respect to r

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:44.850
is the partial-- I'll just read
it to you-- the partial of w

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.210
with respect to x times the
partial of x with respect to r,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.960
plus the partial
of w with respect

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.120
to y times the partial
of y with respect to r,

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.820
plus the partial
of w with respect

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.520
to z times the partial
of z with respect to r.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.640
And as I say, if you
try to memorize that,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.670
it's a very, very
nasty business.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.905
But let's look at this
in three separate pieces.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.390
In a way, can you
sense that this

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.260
is nothing more than the
change in w with respect

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.410
to r due to the
change in x alone?

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.110
In other words, you're
taking here what?

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.970
The change in w due to
x and multiplying that

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.490
by the change in x
with respect to r.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.270
So this is the contribution of
the change in w with respect

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.490
to r due to x alone.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.590
On the other hand, this is
the partial of w with respect

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.840
to r due to the
change in y alone.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.760
And this is the partial
of w with respect

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.670
to r due to the
change in z alone.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.630
And since x, y, and
z are independent,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.990
the change in x, the change
in y, and the change in z

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.900
are also independent variables.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.150
Consequently, it seems
reasonable to assume

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.840
that to find the total change
of w with respect to r,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.990
we just add up all of the
partial contributions.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.700
Namely, we take the
partial of w with respect

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.570
to r due to x alone, add
on to that the partial of w

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.070
with respect to
r due to y alone,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.140
add on to that the
partial of w with respect

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.940
to r due to z alone,
and that that sum should

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.810
be the total change
in w with respect r,

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.120
treating s as a constant.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.000
And by the way, let me point out
a pitfall with this notation.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.980
We're so used to using
fractional notation here.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.350
Have you noticed that if
you're not careful here,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.400
you're almost
tempted to cancel--

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.077
I don't want to write this,
because you'll think that it's

00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:41.160
the right way of doing it.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.620
But see if we say, let's cancel
the partials with respect

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.300
to x here, let's cancel
the partials with respect

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.180
to y here, and let's cancel
the partials with respect

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.200
to z here.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.450
By the way, if you did that,
notice what you would get

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.590
is the contradiction that the
partial of w with respect to r

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.750
is equal to the partial
of w with respect

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.320
to r, plus the partial
of w with respect

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.935
to r, plus the partial
of w with respect to r.

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:06.310
In other words,
it seems that you

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.340
would get that the partial
of w with respect to r

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.150
is always three
times itself, which

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.080
is, I hope, a glaring enough
contradiction so I don't

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.500
have to go into any more detail
about the contradiction part.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:26.460
Notice again, though, why
I have made such a fetish

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.090
over labeling the variables.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.440
Notice that when you're
taking the partial of w

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.919
with respect to x, you're
assuming that y and z

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.490
are the variables that
are being held constant.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.620
And when you're taking the
partial of x with respect to r,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.900
it's s that you're assuming
is being held constant.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.080
And as soon as you look
at these subscripts here,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.120
somehow or other that
should put you on your guard

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.070
to be careful about crossing
out because, after all,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.620
the changes are being
made with respect

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.660
to different sets of variables.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.710
At any rate, this
is the statement.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.990
And my other claim is that
the proof follows immediately

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:09.940
from the main, key theorem that
we stressed last time, even

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.380
though we didn't prove it.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.280
But we've had ample
exercises using this.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.870
Namely, notice that
we have already

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.630
seen that if w does happen to
be a continuously differentiable

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.840
function of x, y, and z, then
delta w is the partial of w

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.290
with respect to x times delta
x, plus the partial of w

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.660
with respect to y times delta
y, plus the partial of w

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.790
with respect to z times
delta z, plus an error term.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.200
And what is that error term?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.740
It's k_1 delta x, plus k_2
delta y, plus k_3 delta

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.200
z, where k_1, k_2,
and k_3 all approach

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.220
0 as delta x, delta y,
and delta z approach 0.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.350
Now again, the key
step in all of this

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:01.940
is that this amount here I
could always call delta w tan,

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.810
or as Professor Thomas calls
it for more than two variables,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:10.530
delta w sub lin, l-i-n, meaning
that this is a linear equation.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.760
Remember-- I've made
an abbreviation here--

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:17.340
these partials are assumed to be
evaluated at a particular point

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.040
that we're interested in.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.060
But the idea is, granted that
I can always call this delta w

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.070
tan, to say that the error has
this small a magnitude depends

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.110
on the fact that w is a
continuously differentiable

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.290
function of x, y, and z.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.310
That's why the theory
is so important.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.380
What happens in real life
is that most examples

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.850
you encounter in real-life
engineering, the functions

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.170
that you're dealing with are
continuously differentiable.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.260
So it seems like we're making
a big issue over nothing.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.100
I should point out that on
the frontiers of knowledge,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.000
enough situations occur where
the functions that we're

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.800
dealing with are not
continuously differentiable,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.610
that some horrible mistakes can
be made by assuming that you

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:09.090
can replace delta w by this,
without any significant error.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.660
But as long as this is
the case, we can do this.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.990
And now notice, what does the
partial of w with respect to r

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.680
mean?

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.050
It means you take delta
w divided by delta r.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.820
And let me just do that here.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.890
I'll just divide
every term by delta r.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.610
And now, what do I have to
do next to get the partial?

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.970
I have to take the limit
as delta r approaches 0.

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.720
Now the interesting point
is as delta approaches 0,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.300
holding s fixed, this
term obviously becomes

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.820
the partial of x with
respect to r, by definition.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.940
This term becomes the partial
of y with respect to r,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:53.180
by definition.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.650
And this term becomes a
partial of z with respect to r,

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.860
by definition.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.070
By the way, notice that even
though delta x, delta y,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:05.020
and delta z are all going
to 0 as delta r goes to 0,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.620
you can not immediately conclude
that these terms drop out.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.800
Because after all, delta
r is also approaching 0.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.380
So delta x over delta r
is that 0 over 0 form.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.890
In fact, that's
precisely the partial

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:21.560
of x with respect to r term
that we're talking about.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.270
The beauty is what?

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.780
That as delta x,
delta y, and delta z

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.840
approach 0, each of
the k's approach 0.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:35.530
You see, the reason that the
error term becomes negligible,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.180
becomes 0 in the limit, isn't
because delta x, delta y,

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.350
and delta z are becoming small.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.550
Because these small
numbers are being divided

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.850
by another small number.

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:49.010
It's because the k_1, k_2,
and k_3 are getting small.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.010
At any rate, putting
this all together,

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.260
notice that now, in
a manner completely

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.380
analogous to our part-one
treatment of the chain rule,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.680
except that we're now dealing
with several variables,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.530
these three terms drop out.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.410
And these three terms become
the claim that we made before.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.040
In other words, this is how the
partial of w with respect to r

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:10.640
is computed.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.600
And again, the theory is
the easiest part of this.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.860
That's the easy part.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.785
The hard part is
getting familiarity

00:13:17.785 --> 00:13:18.910
with how to work with this.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.270
And I think the best way
to get some familiarity

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.470
for working with this is to pick
particularly simple problems

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.300
for the lecture,
problems where it's

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.620
so easy to do the
problem both ways

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.100
that no hangup can
possibly occur.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.900
Let's take a very
simple example.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.830
Let's suppose that
w equals x squared

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.260
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.690
Suppose we also know that x
is r plus s, y is r minus s,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.990
and z happens to be 2r.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.410
In this particular
case, notice that we

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.330
would find the partial of w with
respect to r very conveniently

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.980
by direct substitution.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.270
Namely, we simply
replace x by r plus s,

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.620
we replace y by r minus
s, we replace z by 2r.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.700
And then w simply becomes
this expression here,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.260
which when we collect
terms, becomes

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.460
6 r squared plus 2 s squared.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.460
And again, the arithmetic
there is simple enough

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.543
so I'm not even going to
bother worrying about how

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:18.600
we justify these steps.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.690
At which stage, to take the
partial of w with respect to r,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.956
holding s constant,
this is simply what?

00:14:25.956 --> 00:14:27.070
12r.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.110
Because s is being
treated as a constant,

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.990
its derivative with
respect to r is 0.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.360
You see, in an
example like this,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.530
one would not really be
tempted to use the chain rule.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.680
The chain rule is
used in many cases

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.980
not just for convenience,
but in cases of great theory

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.950
where you're only given that
w is some function of x, y,

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.570
and z, and you're
not told explicitly

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:51.740
what the function is.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.690
You're just given f of x, y, z.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.110
In the case where the
function is given explicitly,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.380
it's sometimes very easy
to substitute directly.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.050
At any rate, what the chain
rule says is roughly this.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.920
They say, lookit.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.440
From this equation,
you could immediately

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.590
say the partial of w
with respect to x is 2x,

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.470
the partial of w with
respect to y is 2y,

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.710
the partial of w with
respect to z is 2z.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.460
From this equation,
you could immediately

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.340
say that the partial of
x with respect to r is 1,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.040
the partial of x with
respect to s is 1,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.920
the partial of y with
respect to r is 1,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.850
the partial of y with
respect to s is minus 1,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.910
the partial of z with
respect to r is 2,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.450
and the partial of z
with respect to s is 0.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:43.380
In particular, summarizing our
results, we have these here.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.300
Now, what the chain
rule says is what?

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.190
To find the partial of
w with respect to r,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.410
you just take the
partial of w with respect

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.540
to x times the partial
of x with respect to r,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.630
plus the partial
of w with respect

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.600
to y times the partial
of y with respect to r,

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.320
plus the partial
of w with respect

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.100
to z times the partial
of z with respect to r.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.150
And if we do that in this
case, we simply get what?

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:11.380
2x plus 2y plus 4z.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.170
Now again, I picked,
deliberately,

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.260
a very simple problem here.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:24.840
Remember, by definition, x
is r plus s, y is r minus s,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.340
and z happens to be 2r.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.770
And now you can see very quickly
here that when I substitute in,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.380
I get what?

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:40.360
2r plus 2r is 4r, plus 8r is
12r, and 2s minus 2s is 0.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.750
The partial of w
with respect to r

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.710
is also 12r, also meaning what?

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.390
We found that same
answer before.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.630
At least that's how
the chain rule works.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.220
And again, we have to remember
that the chain rule does not

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.390
depend on the
number of variables,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.730
even though this may start
to look a little bit sticky.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.340
Let's word it as follows.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:07.109
Suppose w happens to be a
continuously differentiable

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:13.099
function of the n independent
variables x_1 up to x_n.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.190
See, that's what this
parenthetical remark means.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.210
I'm saying that not only do
the partials of f with respect

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.880
to x_1 up to x_n exist
at a given point,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.670
but they are continuous there.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.310
And why do I want that in there?

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.650
So I can say that my
error term is never

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.550
any greater than that k_1
delta x_1, plus k_2 delta x_2,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.680
plus, et cetera, k_n delta
x_n, where the k's go

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.310
to 0 as the delta x's go to 0.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.880
I'm going to spare you
the details of proofs.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.530
But I just want
you to keep seeing

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.400
why these things are necessary.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.170
At any rate, let's suppose now
that each of the n variables

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:56.020
x_1 up to x_n turn out to be
functions of the m variables.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.800
n and m could
conceivably be equal.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.500
But m could even be more than n.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.637
It can be less than n.

00:18:02.637 --> 00:18:04.470
There's no reason why
they have to be equal.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.630
All we're saying is, speaking
in the most general terms,

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:12.040
suppose each of the n x's is
a continuously differentiable

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.870
function of the m independent
variables y sub 1 up

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.880
to y sub m.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.400
In fact, that's what this
"et cetera" means here.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.370
The "et cetera" refers to the
parenthetical remark here.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.590
I mean that not only are the
x's functions of y_1 up to y_m,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:30.890
but they're continuously
differentiable functions.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.180
Now obviously, what we're saying
is that if w can be expressed

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.260
in terms of the x's, the x's
can be expressed in terms

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.480
of the y's, obviously then,
w can be expressed in terms

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.090
of the y's.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.590
In other words, w is some
function of y_1 up to y_m.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.040
Now the question that comes up
is that just looking at this,

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.810
I can talk about the partial
of w with respect to y_1,

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:57.640
the partial of w
with respect to y_2,

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.660
the partial of w with respect to
y_3, et cetera, all the way up

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.820
to the partial of w
with respect to y sub m.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.610
And the question is, lookit.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.900
From the original form of
w, it was easy to talk about

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.060
the partials of w with
respect to the x's.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.620
From how the x's are given in
terms of the y's, it's easy

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.420
to talk about the derivatives
of the x's with respect

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.550
to the y's.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.170
And so the question
is, how do you

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.660
find the partial of w with
respect to, say, y sub

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.690
1, given all of these
other partial derivatives?

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.460
And the answer, again, is
something that you just

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:33.640
have to get used to.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.600
The proof goes through
for n and m the same way

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.780
as it did for the
lower-dimensional case.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.410
And the intuitive
interpretation is the same.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.380
Namely, to find the partial
of w with respect to y_1,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.590
we simply see how much
w changed with respect

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.300
to y_1 due to the
change in x_1 alone,

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.940
add on to that the
change in w with respect

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.720
to y_1 due to the change
in x_2 alone, et cetera,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:07.450
add on to that, finally, the
change in w with respect to y

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.970
sub 1 due to the change
in x sub n alone.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.580
In other words,
again, if you think

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.740
of this in terms
of cancellation,

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.210
if you cross these things out,
don't think of adding them,

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.710
but think of them as what?

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.130
Giving you the
individual components

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:27.450
that tell you how the partial
of w with respect to y_1

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.350
is made up.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.422
By the way, there is
one parenthetical remark

00:20:30.422 --> 00:20:31.880
that I haven't
written on the board

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.920
that I would like to
make at this time.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.440
In Professor
Thomas's text, he has

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.360
elected to introduce
matrix algebra prior

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.420
to this particular chapter.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.800
It again turns out
that one does not

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.340
need matrices to talk
about the chain rule

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.180
but that if one had
matrix notation,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.580
the matrix notation
is particularly

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.680
convenient for summarizing
the chain rule.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.010
I have elected to hold
off on matrix algebra

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.210
till the near future
because it comes up

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.940
in a much better
motivated way, I

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.570
think, in terms of these
linear approximations.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:10.410
But the point is if, as
you're reading the text,

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.980
you see the matrix
notation, and you are not

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.510
familiar with the
matrices, forget it.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.300
All the matrix is, is a shortcut
notation for saying this.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.470
And if I want a
shortcut notation here,

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.530
I don't need matrices
for saying this.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:27.510
I can say this in terms
of our sigma notation.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.780
Notice that one
other way of writing

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.560
this thing very compactly
that may be more suggestive

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.810
is the following.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.440
Notice that I'm adding
up n terms here.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.680
Each term consists of two
factors, each of which

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.430
looks like a fraction.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.260
The numerator of
the first fraction

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.960
is always a partial of w.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.790
The denominator of
the second fraction

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.980
is always the partial y_1.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.330
And it appears that the
denominator of the first

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.600
and the numerator of the second
always have the same subscript,

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.910
but they seem to vary
consecutively from 1 to n.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:10.850
And that's precisely where the
sigma notation comes in handy.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.130
Why don't we just
write, therefore,

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.610
that this is the sum,
partial of w with respect

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.200
to x sub k, plus the
partial of x sub k

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.020
with respect to y_1,
as the subscript

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:28.170
k ranges through all
integral values from 1 to n?

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.270
In other words, notice that
in this particular form,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.310
we have simply rewritten
this thing compactly.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.830
But if you look at
this and look at this,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.220
I think it's very suggestive to
see how the chain rule works.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.940
You see, here's your partial
of w with respect to y_1.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.350
And these are what?

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:51.040
The contributions due to each of
the changes of the n variables.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.350
This is the change due
to the x sub k variable.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.400
And you add these all up because
they're independent variables,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.620
as k goes from 1 to n.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.280
And I write "et cetera"
here simply to point out

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.610
that I could have
computed the partial of w

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.670
with respect to y_2
instead of y sub 1.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.560
By the way, the recipe would've
looked exactly the same,

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.560
except that if there
was a 2 here, there

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.940
would have been a 2 here.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.160
If there were a 3 here,
they would've been a 3 here.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.020
If there were an m here, there
would have been an m here.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.800
OK, now lookit.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.630
At this particular
stage of our lecture

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.080
today, this could
end with the idea

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.440
that for the unit
that's now assigned,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.450
this is as far as
you have to go.

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.870
In other words,
for the exercises

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.890
that I've given you in
this particular unit,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.460
we do nothing higher
than using the chain rule

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.250
for first-order derivatives.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.670
The point is that in many
applications in real life,

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.840
we must take
higher-order derivatives.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.480
In other words, there are
many differential equations,

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:58.360
partial differential
equations, where we must work

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.100
with higher-order derivatives.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.670
And for that reason, it becomes
very important, sometimes,

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.360
to be able to take
a second derivative

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.700
or a third derivative
or a fourth derivative

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.480
by means of the chain rule.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.140
Now the interesting point is
that the theory that we've used

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.420
so far doesn't change at all.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.070
What does happen is that
the average student,

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.960
in learning this material
for the first time,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.080
gets swamped by the notation.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.340
Consequently, what
I want to do is

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.090
to give you the lecture on
this material at the same time

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.850
that I'm lecturing on
first-order derivatives, simply

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:37.640
because the continuity
follows smoother this way,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.380
so that you see what the
whole overall picture is, then

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.740
to make sure that you
cement these things down.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.830
The next unit after
this will give

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.490
you drill on taking
higher-order derivatives.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.440
What this may mean
is that many of you

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.640
may prefer to watch
this half of the film

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.920
a second time,
after you've already

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.490
tried working some
of the problems

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.530
with higher-order
derivatives, if you're still

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.490
confused by this.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.960
But at any rate,
let's take a look

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.660
at a hypothetical situation.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.160
Since we're so used
to polar coordinates,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.910
let's talk in terms
of polar coordinates.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.690
Suppose w happens to be a
continuously differentiable

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.875
function of x and y.

00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:20.760
x and y, in turn, are
continuously differentiable

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.280
functions of the polar
coordinates r and theta.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.860
In fact, they're x
equals r cosine theta,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.850
y equals r sine theta.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:28.540
Now lookit.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.710
If all I want to do is find the
partial of w with respect to r,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.650
I can do that by the
ordinary chain rule.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.010
Namely, it's the partial
of w with respect

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.700
to x times the partial
of x with respect to r,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.360
plus the partial
of w with respect

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.680
to y times the partial
of y with respect to r.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.240
Now, knowing what x
looks like explicitly

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.480
in terms of r and theta and
what y looks like explicitly

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.690
in terms of r and
theta, I can certainly

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.300
compute the partials
of x and y with respect

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:59.560
to r, holding theta constant.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.550
In particular, the partial
of x with respect to r

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:04.200
is simply cosine theta.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.740
And the partial of
y with respect to r

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.170
is simply sine theta.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.140
So the partial of
w with respect to r

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.560
is partial of w with
respect to x times

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.010
cosine theta, plus partial of
w with respect to y times sine

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:18.510
theta.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:23.410
And by the way, notice that I
cannot simplify these terms.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.790
I cannot simplify
these terms in general,

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:29.570
because all I'm given is that
w is some function of x and y.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:33.120
I don't know what w looks like
explicitly in terms of x and y.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.660
So all I can do is talk about
the partials of w with respect

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.320
to x, partial of w respect
to y, without worrying

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.300
any more about this, with the
understanding that if I knew

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.440
what w looked like explicitly
in terms of x and y,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.985
I could work out
what this thing was.

00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:50.440
Now, here's the key point.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.340
That's why I've accentuated it.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.400
In the same way
that w is a function

00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.120
of both x and y, so also are
the partials of w with respect

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.530
to x and the partials
of w with respect to y.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.750
In other words, even
though this looks

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.180
like this emphasizes
the x, notice

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.290
that when you take
the derivative

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:16.040
of a function of both x and y
with respect to x, in general,

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.640
the resulting
function will again

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.300
be a function of both x and y.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.070
And so what we're saying is
that if the partials of w

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.310
with respect to x and the
partials of w with respect to y

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.580
also happen to be continuously
differentiable functions of x

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.905
and y, we could, if we wished,
use the chain rule again.

00:27:34.905 --> 00:27:37.120
In other words, suppose
in the particular problem

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.890
that I was dealing
with, it wasn't

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.320
enough to know the partial
of w with respect to r.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.670
Suppose, for example, I
wanted the second partial of w

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.980
with respect to r.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.220
Well obviously, that
simply means what?

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.360
Take the partial of
this with respect to r.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.590
In other words, the second
partial of w with respect to r

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.070
is just the partial of the
partial of w with respect to r,

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.770
with respect r.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:07.510
I'm just going to differentiate
this thing with respect to r.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.720
In other words, writing this
out more succinctly for you,

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.860
the second partial derivative
of w with respect to r

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.290
is the partial with respect
to r of cosine theta

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:21.400
partial of w with respect to
x, plus sine theta partial

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.640
of w with respect to y.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.750
Now, here's the key point.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.890
When we differentiate
here, we're

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:29.570
assuming that theta is
being held constant.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.850
Isn't that right?

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.720
So consequently, when I'm
differentiating with respect

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.180
to r, cosine theta
is a constant.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.530
I can skip over that,
see, and differentiate

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.764
what's left with respect to r.

00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:43.930
In other words, that's what?

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.440
It's the partial of w with
respect to x differentiated

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.430
with respect to r.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:54.090
See, I'm using the ordinary rule
for the derivative of a sum.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.920
Now, the derivative
of sine theta--

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.860
see, sine theta is a
constant with respect to r.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.590
So the derivative
of this term is just

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.800
sine theta times the
derivative of the partial

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:09.730
of w with respect to y, with
respect to r, written this way.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.320
Now, the key point is that
both of these functions

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.712
here, both of these are
functions of x and y.

00:29:18.712 --> 00:29:22.240
x and y, in turn, are
functions of r and theta.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.920
So in other words,
to differentiate

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:30.120
this thing with respect to r, I
must use the chain rule again.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.000
Now, because this may
seem difficult for you,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.920
all I'm really
saying is, lookit.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.670
If this term here
looks messy, since we

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:40.000
know that the partial
of w with respect to x

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.480
is some function of x and y,
let's call that h of x, y.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.570
Then all we're saying is that
the partial of the partial of w

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.820
with respect to x,
with respect to r,

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.860
is just the partial of
h with respect to r.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.540
But to find the partial
of h with respect to r,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.640
we know how to use
the chain rule there.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.580
It's just what?

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.350
It's the partial
of h with respect

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.720
to x times the partial
of x with respect to r,

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.040
plus the partial
of h with respect

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.780
to y times the partial
of y with respect to r.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:17.655
Of course, if we now
remember what h is-- see,

00:30:17.655 --> 00:30:21.210
h is the partial of
w with respect to x.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.110
So if I differentiate
again with respect to x,

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.210
I get the second partial
of w with respect to x.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:30.760
We've already seen that the
partial of x with respect to r

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.220
is cosine theta, so
I have this term.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.950
The partial of h with respect
to y really says what?

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.310
Differentiate the
partial of w with respect

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:44.470
to x, with respect to y.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:46.820
And the usual way
of abbreviating that

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.590
is like this, which, again,
is explained in the reading

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.100
material.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.540
And we now multiply that by
the partial of y with respect

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.580
to r, which happens
to be sine theta.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.870
Now, look at this a few
times in your spare time,

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.060
if it's bothering you.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.390
It is not really
that difficult. It

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:10.260
is messy notation in the
sense that you're not

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.804
used to notation that's
quite that messy.

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:13.720
That's why it's messy.

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.150
Once you get used
to it, it is not

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:18.550
any tougher than the chain rule
for one independent variable.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.910
In fact, to take the
partial of the partial of w

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:26.270
with respect to y, with respect
to r, I'll do that in one step

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.830
without using a substitution.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.220
All I'm saying is
that this function

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.200
depends on both x and y.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.710
So to see what its derivative
is with respect to r,

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.790
I'll see what the contribution
of its derivative with respect

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.780
to r is due to just x alone.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.120
Then I'll see what
contribution of its derivative

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.940
with respect to r is
due to just y alone.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.780
And by the way, when
I say it that way,

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:51.070
notice how quick it is
to write this thing down.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.490
I differentiate
this with respect

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:56.120
to x multiplied by the partial
of x with respect to r.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.130
Add on to that the partial
of this with respect to y.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.390
Multiply that by the partial
of y with respect to r.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:05.400
If I do this, notice
now I have what?

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.710
I have the partial
with respect to y.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.370
And I differentiate
that with respect to x.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.350
That's written this way.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.960
And by the way, notice that
this is the reverse order

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.020
of what we did over here.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.060
Namely, in one case, we first
differentiated with respect

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:24.410
to x and then with respect to y.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.810
In the other case, we
differentiated first

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:29.770
with respect to y and
then with respect to x.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.510
So that actually, conceptually
there is a difference.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.980
That's why we write
these things differently.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.010
It does, again, turn
out that in most cases,

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.680
the answer that you
get-- thank goodness--

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.820
doesn't depend on the
order in which you

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.120
perform the derivatives.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.070
But this is not at
all self-evident,

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.170
even though you'd like
to believe that it is.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.050
But we'll talk about that more
in the exercises and the like.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.320
But all I'm saying now is that
if we put everything together

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.270
of what we've had
before, we can obtain,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.390
in this particular case,
that the second partial of w

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:08.700
with respect to r is this
somewhat messy but nonetheless

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.770
straightforward expression.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.280
And see, I've
circled these things

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.120
to sort of tell you that if it
is permissible to interchange

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.670
the order of differentiation, we
could combine these two terms.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.650
On the other hand, if you
couldn't interchange the order,

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:27.040
this would be a
rather dangerous thing

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.090
to do over here because these
might be different answers.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.960
As I say again, if you
have enough continuity,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.514
it turns out that these
two factors are the same.

00:33:37.514 --> 00:33:39.180
But that's not the
important issue here.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.160
The important issue
here is that I

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.400
can keep using the chain rule to
take higher-order derivatives.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.780
And even though the
notation is messier,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.020
this happened when we dealt with
functions of a single variable.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:52.750
Remember when we
used the chain rule

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:58.640
to find dy/dx when y and x were
given, say, as functions of t?

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.910
We could also use the chain rule
to find the second derivative

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.380
of y with respect to x.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.550
But we had to be a little bit
more careful of the computation

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.409
because certain factors crept
in that we had to keep track of.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:13.870
At any rate, again, to
illustrate this idea

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.980
rather than to keep
droning on about it,

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.449
let me take a particularly
simple computational problem

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:20.409
to check this thing on.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.908
In other words,
what I'm going to do

00:34:21.908 --> 00:34:25.469
is take this messy formula over
here and apply it to a case

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:29.929
where the arithmetic happens
to be very, very simple.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.070
I'm going to rig this
very, very nicely.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:35.130
I'm going to let f of x, y just
be x squared plus y squared,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.489
in this case.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.800
Let w be x squared
plus y squared.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.790
In polar coordinates, notice
that x squared plus y squared

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.030
is just r squared.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.820
So w is just r squared.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.870
What is the partial of w
with respect to r, then?

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.139
The partial of w with
respect to r is 2r.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.675
And if I now differentiate
that with respect to r,

00:34:56.675 --> 00:35:00.010
the second partial of w
with respect to r is 2.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.760
Obviously, one would not use
the chain rule in real life

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.090
to find the answer to
this particular problem.

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:10.340
We've chosen this problem
simply to emphasize how

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.570
the chain rule would work here.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.350
At any rate, going
back here, notice

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:18.000
that it's very simple to
see from this equation

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.910
that the partial of w
with respect to x is 2x.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.480
Therefore, the second partial
of w with respect to x is 2.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.090
The partial of w with
respect to y is 2y.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:34.400
Therefore, the second partial of
w with respect to y is also 2.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.800
The partial of w with respect
to x is a function of x alone,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.870
in this case.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.450
Consequently, the derivative
with respect to y will be 0.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:46.510
Similarly, the partial of w with
respect to y is a function of y

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.320
alone.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.970
Consequently, when
I differentiate

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:51.930
that with respect to x,
meaning I'm holding y constant,

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.190
that derivative will also be 0.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:36:00.670
And the interesting point
now is if I take these values

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:06.430
and substitute those into
this equation, what happens?

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.990
Look.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.900
The second partial of w
with respect to x is just 2.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.840
The second partial of w
with respect to y is just 2.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:19.700
The mixed partials are both
0, regardless of which order

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.860
you did them in.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:22.620
That's what we saw over here.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.100
So consequently,
according to this recipe,

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.840
the second partial of
w with respect to r

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.580
is 2 cosine squared
theta plus 0 plus 2 sine

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.390
squared theta plus 0,
where the reason I've

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:37.326
written these 0's
in is simply so

00:36:37.326 --> 00:36:39.200
that when you're looking
at your notes later,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.980
that traces the analog
of these terms over here.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.310
At any rate, notice now
that if I add these up,

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.740
2 cosine squared
theta plus 2 sine

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.900
squared theta,
since sine squared

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.330
theta plus cosine
squared theta is 1,

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.570
this sum is just-- I'll
write that in white chalk

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:00.020
just so we don't accentuate it.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.830
Let it just be
part of the answer.

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.180
This is 2 plus 0, which is 2.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.280
And this certainly does
check with the result

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.520
that we got the
so-called easier way.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.990
And again, I don't want
to leave you with the idea

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:18.320
that the second way was
just the hard way of doing

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.140
the same problem that we
did easily the first way.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.490
I picked a simple example so
you can see how this works.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.140
I'm going to have a
multitude of exercises

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:31.920
for you to do in the next unit,
simply so that you'll pick up

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.160
the kind of know-how that will
allow you to change variables

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.750
using the chain rule, with a
minimum degree of difficulty.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.660
In fact, hopefully,
I would like to feel

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.930
by the time we're through
with the next two units,

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.280
you will be doing this
almost as second nature.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.950
Well, we have other
topics to consider

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.780
in terms of our linear
approximations and the like.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.950
We'll talk about that more
as the course unfolds.

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:02.560
For the time being, I would
like you to concentrate simply

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.930
on mastering the chain rule.

00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.620
And so until we meet
next time, good bye.
