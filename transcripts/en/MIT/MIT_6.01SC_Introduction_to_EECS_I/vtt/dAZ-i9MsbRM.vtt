00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.510
PROFESSOR: Today I'd like to
talk to you about a new method

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.790
for solving circuits.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.520
Last time, we reviewed using
KVL, KCL, and Ohm's Law in

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.780
order to solve circuits
in a general sense.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.060
This produced a lot of
equations, in particular, a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.530
lot of redundant equations or a
lot of dependent equations,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.090
that we don't necessarily need
for solving our circuit.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.880
Today I'm going to review the
Node Voltage Component Current

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.135
method, which is very similar
to node analysis.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:32.390
So if you hear one versus the
other, know that you're

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.030
talking about approximately
the same thing.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.960
And I'll review the difference
in a second.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.520
Once we know how to use the
NVCC method for solving

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.360
circuits, we can express the
relationships between

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.370
components in our circuit
more concisely and more

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.150
effectively, and possibly solve
our equations faster,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.825
which is relevant when we're
working on a mid-term or in

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:54.680
the general sense, just
trying to save time.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.930
Let's take a look at NVCC.

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:03.370
As I said before NVCC,
stands for Node

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.940
Voltage Component Current.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.990
And what that means is if you
have a very simple circuit--

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.690
let's say just a voltage source

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:13.940
and a couple of resistors.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
Previously, with KVL, we were
interested in the voltage drop

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.380
around the loop being
equivalent to 0.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.370
In this case, we're actually
going to look at the voltages

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.795
associated with particular
nodes.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.030
To do that we're going to label
our nodes, which are

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.465
anywhere our components
connect.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.740
We're also going to go after
the component current.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
When we're doing KCL, we
typically look at the flow in

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.420
and out of a particular node.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.820
At this point, we're going to
look at the flow through a

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.650
given component.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.110
So we're also going to label all
of the currents associated

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.289
with our circuit.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.370
But when we approach NVCC
method, we're going to think

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.020
about the currents flowing
through a particular component

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.100
as opposed to and out of
a particular node.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.610
NVCC is sort of the opposite of
KVL and KCL in that sense,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490
even though you're still going
to end up using the same

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.740
relationships.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.830
So at this point, I've labeled
the currents going through--

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.780
I labeled one individual current
for every component in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.030
my circuit.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.450
The next step would be to
identify what I'm going to

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.520
call ground, or in particular,
one of my nodes --

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.740
I'm going to assign to ground
or relative voltage 0.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.600
At that point, I'm going to
write out the relationships

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.050
between the voltage drop across
particular components,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.460
the current flowing through that
particular component, and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.090
whatever relationship the
component requires the voltage

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.920
and the current to have
to one another.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.340
That's a whirlwind review
of NVCC method.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.870
Node analysis is very similar.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.840
The main difference between node
analysis and NVCC method

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.720
is when your component
is a voltage source.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.840
And there are multiple currents
flowing into that

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.500
voltage source.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.870
You can treat this as
a single voltage.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.330
You can treat this as a single
voltage node, where this

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.140
voltage it has value 0.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:35.710
And actually write your KCL
equations as though this point

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.450
were collapsed.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.010
So current flowing in and
current flowing out, or vice

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.580
versa, have to sum to 0.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.470
That's the major difference.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.720
Let's look at an example.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.110
You can find this example
repeated in

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.680
6.4.3 of the reading.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.940
And I'm going to walk through
these directions.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.910
So the first thing I'm going
to do is label my

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.160
nodes and my currents.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.330
People interchangeably
use e or n.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.580
It doesn't really matter.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.420
I guess n in particular could
refer to the node, while e in

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.580
particular could refer
to the voltage

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.830
associated with that node.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.610
Now I'm going to specify the
voltage drop across a

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.720
particular component in terms
of the node voltages.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.990
I'm also going to assign
n0 to 0 as my ground.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.070
As a consequence, I know that
n1 is going to be 15 Volts.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.290
My voltage drop is typically
specified in the same

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:36.800
direction as the current -
that I've also decided.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.710
So this convention
is arbitrary.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.140
But if you want to be consistent
in your work, and

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.490
make it easier to get partial
credit or get help in office

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.570
hours, et cetera, then assume
that the voltage drop occurs

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.090
in the same direction
as the current.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.800
That's it for our relationship
associated with voltage drop.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.930
Now I'm going to go over KCL
for the relevant nodes.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.660
And in the last step I'm going
to combine the two into the

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.280
equation that you're certainly
allowed to use to express your

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.440
work on midterms.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.720
Or if you can skip
to the third step

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.540
immediately, then that's OK.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.840
Just check your signs.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.090
Here's the second step.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.370
Flowing into n1 is i0 and
flowing out is i1.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.410
So i0 is going to
be equal to i1.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.040
Flowing into n2 is i1 and i3.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.700
And flowing out of n2 is i2.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:42.020
Flowing into n0 is i2,
and flowing out of

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.710
n0 is i0 and i3.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.900
we're almost certainly
not going to end

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.810
up using that equation.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.680
Because it's the last of our KCL
equations and is dependent

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.230
upon the other equations
that we've already

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.480
written out for KCL.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.070
I3 is equal to 10 Amperes.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.865
So we can go ahead and make
that substitution.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.860
I still have to work with
i1 and i2 though.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.320
And I can go after expressions
for them in terms of my node

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.980
voltages and components by
using the equations for

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.510
voltage drop I made earlier.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.120
This is the equation that you
can jump straight to, if you

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.340
understand where this expression
comes from, as a

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:44.555
consequence, of our KCL and also
our component voltages.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.030
I'm going to substitute in
15 Volts for n1 here.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.710
And now I have an expression
that only contains n2 and

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.870
known values.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.720
So I can solve for n2.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.750
and I'll do that real
quickly right now.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.360
So first I'm just going
to copy this over.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.270
I'm going to multiply
through by 6 Ohms.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:20.270
And I solved for the voltage
associated with n2.

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:34.180
At this point, I can solve
for i2 and i1.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.290
Sorry about that.

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.730
What do I have left?

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.390
i3 I know is 10 Amperes.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.015
i0 is equal to i1, which
is negative 1 Amperes.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:11.660
There's a voltage drop
associated with the 3 Ohm

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:19.060
resistor, which is 15 minus
18, negative 3 Volts.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.950
And the voltage drop associated
with the 2 Ohm

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.190
resistor is 18 Volts,
since n0 is ground.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.860
This concludes my introduction
to node voltage component

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.470
current method or node analysis
without the ability

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:49.510
to collapse voltage
sources for KCL.
