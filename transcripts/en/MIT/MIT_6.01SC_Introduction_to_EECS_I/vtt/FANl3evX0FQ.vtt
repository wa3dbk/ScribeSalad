00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:26.650
PROFESSOR: So today I
want to finish up

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.900
thinking about circuits.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.460
And the major topic for
today is just one --

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.890
thinking about abstractions that
we can use for thinking

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.690
about circuits.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.220
The attractions are things that
capitalize on linearity.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.560
And they include things like
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.810
superposition.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.430
OK so what I want to
do is finish up

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.760
thinking about circuits.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.900
And just to get you thinking
about circuits, let's think

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.770
about where we are.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.840
Last time we saw that one of the
issues in thinking about

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.380
circuit design, is the fact that
every part, in principle,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.040
interacts with every
other part.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.210
Which makes the design process
harder than the design process

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.580
was for things like linear
systems, where we thought

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.240
about boxes having inputs
and outputs.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.300
In linear systems, when we
thought about boxes having

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.260
inputs and outputs, the output
didn't necessarily have any

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.230
affect on the input,
unless there was an

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.490
explicit path feedback.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.830
In circuits, there's
feedback always.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.070
There's no way to avoid it.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.320
And in fact, that coupling can
make thinking about the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.380
circuits very difficult.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.530
And we introduce that idea by
just thinking about, even if

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.110
you wanted to close a switch,
you know a circuit, that's

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.760
logically the same as
adding a new part.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.050
And when you do that, that's
going to change the currents

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.320
and voltages everywhere.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.250
So that's kind of a big thing--
that's kind of the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.500
thing that's different about
circuits from what we've been

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.750
thinking about before.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.330
Because that complicates design,
we'd like some way of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.110
dealing with it.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.850
And the way we introduced, and
the way that you used in the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.280
lab, so far, has been
to use a buffer.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.620
We can use an op-amp
to make a buffer.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.480
And a buffer has this nice
isolation property.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.010
In this particular circuit, it
has the property that it

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.820
copies this voltage to the
output, regardless of what's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.070
at the output.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.340
That means we could put a switch
here, we could change

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.760
the light bulb, we could do
anything we wanted to, and we

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.190
would still know, because of the
properties of the op-amp,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.677
we would still know that this
voltage is going to be 8

00:02:32.677 --> 00:02:34.730
Volts, regardless of
what we put there.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.890
So that's very nice, that gives
us a modularity, that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.600
gives us a way to
design things.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.990
It let's us design the left--

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.580
make a circuit that generates
8 Volts without knowing

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.030
precisely what's going
to be the ultimate

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.820
circuit that that drives.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.910
So that's nice, it allows
us to do modularity.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.650
And in many instances, that's
a very good solution.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.310
In fact in the solution-- in
the problems that you are

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.320
working on in lab, where you're

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.280
trying to drive a motor--

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.710
that's an excellent solution.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.200
It's not always an excellent
solution.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.590
In some sense, it's
very expensive.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.620
An op-amp is a complicated
part.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.860
If you were to look inside an
op-amp, there's some two dozen

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.470
transistors in most op-amps.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.190
So it's not an inexpensive
part, especially when you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.310
think about this kind of a
circuit that only has three

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.770
parts to the left.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.110
The op-amp is actually a more
complex device than

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.370
anything else up.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.700
So op-amps are wonderful,
op-amps allow us to make

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.060
buffers, buffers are wonderful,
but they're not

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.540
always the best solution for
thinking about modularity.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.940
And, in fact, there's
other ways.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.020
And so that's what we want to
think about today is -- other

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.800
ways for achieving modularity
in circuit design.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.830
And the key to thinking about
this, is to think about, well,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.540
what's the worst thing
that could happen?

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.440
If I changed this part
arbitrarily, just how bad can

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.690
things get?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.640
So I'll let you answer that.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.459
Think about that circuit, and
assume that this is a 90 Volt

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.680
power supply, 3 Ohm, 6 Ohm,
but this can change--

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.930
R0 can change.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.650
I've tabulated some values of R0
and putative, corresponding

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.270
values for V0 and I0.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.920
Are my putative answers right?

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.150
So take a minute, talk to
your neighbor, figure

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.710
out how many of these--

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.220
let's see-- ten blue numbers
are right or wrong.

00:05:40.613 --> 00:05:42.470
It's very quiet, you are allowed
to talk to people.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.160
So how many of the numbers
are wrong?

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.230
So raise your hand, indicate
by number fingers how many

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.790
mistakes are in the table.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:03.820
More votes, more votes--

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.110
come on, come on.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.900
if you had talked more, you
could blame it on your

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.100
neighbor more easily,
so talk quickly.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.330
OK.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.585
So does everybody agree
with their neighbor?

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.100
OK, i don't see a single
right answer.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.429
So take 30 more seconds and
think about it again.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.590
I don't see any right answers.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.261
So assume your answer's wrong.

00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:42.690
[CHUCKLES]

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.380
Color blind--

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.180
OK, so how many of
the voltages and

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.430
currents are incorrect?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.950
OK, how about a re-vote?

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.620
So how many of the
blue numbers--

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.890
the currents and voltages,
how many of V0 and I0 --

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.140
how many of those
are incorrect?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.970
OK, not very many votes--

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.150
I'd say about 80%
correct, now.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.020
That's definitely
an improvement.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.300
What would have to be true?

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.590
If I wanted to prove that some
of these numbers were wrong,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.340
what could I do?

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.490
Give me a condition that would
have to be true if the numbers

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.740
were correct.

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:48.004
AUDIENCE: V0 has to equal I0?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:50.140
PROFESSOR: V0 has to equal I0.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.460
We know that this resistor
better be--

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.080
better obey Ohm's Law.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.940
That's what we mean
by that symbol.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:00.750
So it had better be the
case that V0 is I0R0.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.920
So you you'd want this
number to be the

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.600
product of that and that.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.810
So 0 is the product of 0 and
30, that looks good.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:13.750
30 is 2 times 15, 36 is 3 times
12, 48 is 6 times 8.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.320
60 is--

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.000
well that's a little marginal.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.630
how about if I rearrange it
a little bit, and say

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.880
what if R is V/I?

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.770
If I is 0, that would make the
resistor infinity, so there's

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.180
a way of thinking about that
last line as correct.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.160
That's a little funny.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.280
Maybe the forward way of
thinking about it is, well

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.700
what if I made the resistor
infinite?

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.060
if I made the resistor infinite,
what would be I?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.330
0.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.580
And what would be V?

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.175
What would be the voltage
difference if

00:10:50.175 --> 00:10:52.887
this were right, then?

00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:53.873
The voltage divider--

00:10:53.873 --> 00:10:54.859
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:10:54.859 --> 00:10:58.063
PROFESSOR: So if there's no
current here, then you can use

00:10:58.063 --> 00:10:59.800
the voltage relationship--
the voltage-divider

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.070
relationship here.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.240
6 over (3 plus 6) times 90 --

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.290
which is 60.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.820
So if you use straightforward
reasoning saying, what if the

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.150
resistor was infinitely large?

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.990
What would happen?

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.760
Then you would conclude that
the bottom line is OK.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.630
If you choose--

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.770
if you show that R equals
V over I, are you done?

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.800
What else has to be true
in order for the

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.050
numbers to be true?

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.370
It's not very hard.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.306
AUDIENCE: The voltages drop out
of the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:37.790
The resistor has to be
the same as the--

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.330
PROFESSOR: So the voltages--

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.300
that's an instance--

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.310
what you just said-- is
an instance of KVL.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.360
Basically, the voltage around
all of the loops better be 0.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.550
The sum of the voltages around
all of the loops better be 0,

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.290
and the sum of the currents in
all of those closed surfaces

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.250
better be 0, right?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.540
KVL better be satisfied
everywhere, and KCL better be

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.240
satisfied everywhere.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.740
So, in particular, we can
ask about this node.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.660
We could say, do the currents
flowing into

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:05.580
that node sum to 0?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.560
So if you take a line here--
let's take this line--

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.710
if V0 happened to be--

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.070
V0 happens to be the voltage
here, right?

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:19.730
So if V0 were 36, then that puts
some voltage on this leg.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.353
36 would what, 54?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.500
So then you'd have to say--

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.420
you'd have to compute, then, the
current through here and

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.410
the current through there,
and see if those

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.790
currents sum to 0.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.890
And, in fact, if you do those
calculations, you if you can

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.830
convince yourself of
those are all true.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.690
So the answer was 0.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.640
All of those answers
were true.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.320
The point of doing the exercise
was to just remind

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.260
you about how you solve
circuits, but also to let us

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.090
look at patterns.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.650
The interesting thing in this
problem is the pattern the

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:00.140
results between the
V's and the I's.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:06.290
So if I were to make a plot, in
fact, those V's and I's all

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.180
fall on a straight line.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.400
Well that's pretty
interesting.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.720
So if I plot just this
V versus this I--

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.974
so V equals 0, 30, 36,
0, 30, 36, 48, 60 --

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.380
and the corresponding
I's, 30,15,12,6,0 --

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.360
30,15,12,6,0.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.190
Those points all fall
on a straight line.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.820
That suggests that there's
some pattern here.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.630
And if there's a pattern, then
there might be a way to

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.730
exploit it.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.720
So that's what I'm trying
to develop--

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.840
is a way to exploit the pattern
that results when

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.470
parts of circuits interact.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.180
The interesting thing
that we--

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.160
so not only is it true that
there's a simple pattern, but

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.370
it turns out that the pattern
is completely independent of

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.003
the thing that I put
on the right.

00:14:02.003 --> 00:14:06.165
The pattern is a property of
the circuit to the left.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.170
One way to convince yourself
of that is to substitute--

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:17.120
take that resistor out, and put
in a voltage source, and

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.540
redo the problem.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.180
This time, instead of assuming
that there's an Ohm's Law-type

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.120
resistor here, assume there's
a constant voltage, and that

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.410
constant voltage is adjusted
to 0,30,36,48,60.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.600
If you re-solve that
problem, you get

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.930
exactly these same currents.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:41.710
The answer continues to fall
on exactly the same line.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.270
So that's a very interesting
pattern.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.800
The idea is that when the
circuit on the left interacts

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.430
with the circuit on the right,
regardless of what the circuit

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:53.490
on the right is, you get a
simple relationship between

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.730
the voltage and current
that comes out of the

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.980
circuit on the left.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.510
So that motivates the idea that
we can think about the

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:09.260
left-hand circuit as some
kind of a generic part.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.490
We call that generic
part a one-port.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.750
Think about this circuit on the
left-- the thing that's in

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.100
the red box--

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.120
it's got at its terminals--

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.490
the terminals are the things
that poke through the red box.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.530
First off it has two terminals,
two terminals is

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.760
just like all of our
other parts.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.020
And it's like a resistor, it's
like a voltage source, it's

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.800
like a current source, it's
a two terminal device.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.460
And just like a voltage source
or a resistor or a current

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.480
source, there's some voltage
across those terminals, and

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.470
there's some current that flows
in those terminals.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.170
So there's some current
that goes in the plus.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.210
And that same current
comes out the minus.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.080
That'll be true for this
circuit, just the same as it's

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.780
true for a resistor or voltage
source or anything else, the

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:57.580
only difference is, the thing
that's inside the box--

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.100
the thing that's inside
the one-port--

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.510
is more complicated than it was
for a simple resistor or

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.080
voltage source or
current source.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.550
So what we can think about, is
this whole red box just looks

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.320
like a super part.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.700
So the interesting thing that
happens is, this red box

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.300
behaves like a one-port,
like a super part.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.510
And just like a resistor has a
relationship between V and I,

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.610
V equals IR, Or a voltage source
has some kind of a

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.520
constraint, V equals V0.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.250
Or a current source
has some kind of a

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.460
constraint, I equals I0.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.740
This funny part has a
relationship between V and I

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.340
that's given by that curve.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.180
In some sense, it's not
very different.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.510
So we think that--

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.960
so what we want to do now is
figure out the rules that

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.780
govern the currents
and voltages that

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.030
flow through one-ports.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:03.900
And in particular, how special
was this straight line thing?

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.990
I mean if they were always a
straight line, that would be

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.960
really easy, right?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.900
So the question--

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.650
so the next question I'd like to
ask is, just how often are

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.680
we expecting to see straight
lines there?

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.260
I already said, the primitive
elements that we think about--

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.390
Ohm's Law, resistors, voltage
sources, current sources--

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:28.109
they have straight line
constraints between the

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:32.170
voltages and currents that
they can generate.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.080
So think about what I'm doing.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.630
I'm trying to think about a rule
that's going to let me

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.370
describe the currents and
voltages into that red box

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:42.340
from the previous slide, much
like I would describe the

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.680
voltages and currents in an
Ohm's Law a resistor.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.910
I can tell you the
voltage-current relationship,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:53.550
V equals IR for an Ohm's
resistor, independent of what

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.190
it's connected to.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.850
That's the reasoning that
I'm using here.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.450
I'm going to try to figure out,
independent of what it is

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.150
connected to, what will be the
voltage-current relationship

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.640
for the red box?

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:10.510
So the question is, when are we
expecting straight lines,

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.360
and when are we not expecting
straight lines?

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.480
So here's a simple circuit.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.650
Here's a super part made out
of one linear resistor, one

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.090
Ohm's Law resistor, and
one voltage source.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.680
What's the current-voltage
relationship for that part?

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.280
What if I put a red box around
the whole thing, and asked you

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.920
to draw the I-V curve, the
current voltage curve?

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.120
Which would it look
like, A,B,C,D --

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.670
which should have been
(1), (2), (3), (4) --

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.380
so you can raise fingers,
or none of the above?

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.440
So take 30 seconds.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.985
Figure out what would be the
I-V curve for this part.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.850
So if you map A to D
into (1) to (4) --

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.290
which of those plots describes
the current-voltage

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.610
relationship for that circuit?

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.890
Map A to D to (1) to (4).

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:42.890
OK, you're quiet, and the
success rate is smaller than

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.240
usual, about 50% correct.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.800
Take 30 seconds, reconsider your
answer, try to get this

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.050
up to 85% or so.

00:22:13.258 --> 00:23:13.150
[CHATTER]

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.920
So which is the best plot?

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.140
Which plot best characterizes
the circuit on the top?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.620
OK, that's much better.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.000
That's about 75%.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.490
Certainly not 100%,
but better.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.970
OK so how do you think
about this?

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.960
One way to think about
it is special cases.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.900
Can you think about any
special cases that are

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.450
particularly easy to check?

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.680
0 --

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.295
OK, what equals 0?

00:23:46.295 --> 00:23:47.430
AUDIENCE: V or I --

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.490
PROFESSOR: V or I --

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:48.960
yes.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.340
So what if you were to make --

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.120
if you were to make
I equal to 0?

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.950
First off, if you made
I equal to 0, what's

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.982
special in the plots?

00:23:58.982 --> 00:24:03.240
If I equals 0, then you
round up x-axis.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.470
Sorry, if you make I
0, what will V be?

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:12.775
If you made I be 0,
how big will be V?

00:24:12.775 --> 00:24:14.980
5 Volts, right?

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.740
If you make I be 0,
then there's no

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.700
voltage across the resistor.

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.280
So the total voltage here will
be the same as the voltage

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.690
across the voltage source,
V equals 5.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.310
So the intersection on the
x-axis should be at the point

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.610
V equals 5.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.780
Makes sense?

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.400
Now if you said V equals
0, how big would I be?

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:46.660
If you set V equal to 0 -- how
do you set V equal to 0?

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.654
AUDIENCE: Negative 2.5.

00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:51.133
PROFESSOR: Negative 2.5, so
what is negative 2.5?

00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:53.630
AUDIENCE: The value of I.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.416
PROFESSOR: So do you need--

00:24:55.416 --> 00:24:59.900
how do we set V equal to 0?

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.682
What's the circuit way of
saying, set V equal to 0?

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.530
You set V equals 0
in a circuit by--

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.450
AUDIENCE: Grounding.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.030
PROFESSOR: --grounding,
by setting it--

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.540
by putting in a wire.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.516
So you run a wire from
here to here.

00:25:18.516 --> 00:25:20.430
Voltage across a wire
is always 0, right?

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.680
So you set something to 0 by
putting a wire across it.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.220
We call that a short circuit.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.990
OK, there's a short path
for the voltage travel.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:34.100
So you put a short circuit here,
and then I becomes V

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:40.330
over R, and the only trick
is that it's up, right?

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.050
Current likes to flow down the
electrochemical gradient.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.760
So it likes to go down the
electrical gradient.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.580
So the current is going to
go up, but the reference

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:56.790
direction for this I is down,
so I is minus 2.5.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:26:01.310
So the intersection on this
axis is minus 2.5.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.710
So we know that it has to go
through a negative on the

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:09.130
bottom, and it has to go through
a positive V on the

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.670
x-axis, and the only curve
that does that is (A).

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.180
And if we wanted to be a little
bit more fancy, we

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.210
could figure out the
general rule.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.870
We could just write an
expression for Vr.

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.040
Well by KVL, Vr is always
the difference

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.190
between V and 5 Volts.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.040
And we could write an expression
for the current

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.780
through the resistor.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.730
That's just V over R. Vr
is V minus 5, R is 2.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.770
So I get some expression which
is, lo and behold, linear in

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.660
V. So just like that more
complicated circuit that I'd

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:46.860
looked at, I ended up with a
straight line relationship in

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.990
the current voltage--

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:49.980
the relationship between the
current and voltage falls on a

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.990
straight line.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.160
So how special is that?

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.770
Well it actually happens
pretty robustly.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.990
Think about what would happen
if I had two parts, the

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:03.130
generically--

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.840
so I'm thinking about these
being generic boxes, inside

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.710
could be anything.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.430
There could be a current source,
a voltage source, a

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.060
linear resistor, or some
other one-port.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.590
So if I had a generic box here,
and a generic box here,

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:20.320
and I connected them in
parallel, under the condition

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.020
that each of the generic boxes
had a straight line

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.060
current-voltage relationship,
it's easy to argue that the

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.210
resulting relationship between
current and voltage for the

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.940
parallel combination is
also a straight line.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.060
All you need to do is realize
that if you hook two things in

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.300
parallel, the parallel voltage
is the same as V1 and V2.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.210
So all the voltages
are the same.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.220
And the currents add.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.270
So Ip, the current end of the
parallel combination is the

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.520
sum of the two I's.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.860
So if you think about the
relationship between V1 and

00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.730
I1, and the relationship between
V2 and I2, you could

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.760
derive the relationship
between Ip

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.020
and Vp by just adding.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.710
V1 equals v2 equals Vp, that's
what we saw here.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:13.650
And the current at the
bottom is the sum of

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.900
the other two currents.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.170
So, in particular, if this was
a straight line, and that was

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.490
a straight line, the sum of
two straight lines is a

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.830
straight line, right?

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.090
If you add two straight lines,
you get a new straight line.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.200
So what this shows is that if
you started with parts that

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.630
were themselves straight lines,
parallel combinations

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:39.960
would generate a new part with
another straight line.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.390
Same sort of thing happens if
the two parts we're in series.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.100
In series we would
have Iseries --

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.820
it's the same as
I1 equals I2--

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.300
so that's the equivalent of the
y-axes, where previously

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.660
we had equivalents
of the x-axes.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.250
And now if both of these boxes
had linear I-V curves, I would

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:07.290
now add horizontally rather
than adding vertically.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.840
But I have the same result.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.470
If the two, individual one-ports
had linear I-V

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:19.280
curves, and if I add
horizontally, I'll get a new

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.750
linear I-V curve.

00:29:23.642 --> 00:29:26.910
And in fact, if you start--

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.830
if you put any combination of
parts that have linear I-V

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:37.350
curves together to form
a new circuit--

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.470
a new one-port, the I-V curve
for that new one-port will be

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.280
a linear function.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.530
And the way to see that, is to
think about linear equations.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.570
Remember when we solve a
circuit, we have to have one

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:57.385
law for every element, Like
Ohm's Law-- it's V equals IR,

00:29:57.385 --> 00:30:00.480
or voltage source is V equals
V0 or something like that--

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.970
we need one law for
every element.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.570
And then we have KVL and KCL.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.310
Well all of the-- if we start
with the assumption that each

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:14.210
component has a straight line
relationship between voltage

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:16.760
and current, which is true for
linear resistors, voltage

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.000
sources, and current sources.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.020
Those equations that describe
those parts are what we call

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.270
linear equations.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:33.570
Linear equation is an equation
where the function of the

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.760
unknowns is a quote --

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.950
linear function.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.920
It has the form--

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.750
some constant times an unknown,
plus some other

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.140
constant times some other
unknown, plus, in principle,

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.310
any number of those.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.923
But it has to be a linear
function, so you're not

00:30:49.923 --> 00:30:52.950
allowed to have things like
V-squared in there.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.480
But if you think about things
like voltage sources and

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.130
current sources and Ohm's Law,
they don't have squares in

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.180
there, they're linear
equations.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.000
And the idea then, when we're
solving for the I-V

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.810
relationship for this new
one-port thing, all we're

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.760
doing is we're solving a system
of linear equation.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.820
Sort of in the abstract, the
idea is that we write down all

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.140
of the component equations
inside the box, we write down

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.570
all of the relevant KVL and
KCL, and then we solve.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.570
So they're all going to have--

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.850
each one of those equations is
going to be linear, so it's

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:32.200
going to be something like, say,
a0x0 if x is my unknown.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.270
'x' could be a current
or a voltage.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:40.080
And then I might have sum of x1,
then I might have sum of

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.020
x2, and I might have a whole
bunch of things, and they all

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:48.790
add together to be some
constant, like that.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.550
So that might represent
part one--

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:55.270
that might represent one of
the components in the box.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.310
Then I would have another
component, which would be some

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.075
other linear equation.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.930
Then I'd have a KCL equation,
well KCL is easy, because that

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.410
only has currents in it,
and the multipliers are

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:15.260
all 1 or minus 1.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.670
Right, so that's
clearly linear.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:18.300
And I have KVL equations.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.840
Those are linear.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:24.260
And the point is, that when you
solve linear equations,

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.240
you get a new linear equation.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:30.200
So think about solving this by
the method of substitution.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.060
I could figure out
what is x0 here.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.860
If I use this equation
to figure out x0.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.000
x0 would be a linear function
of all the other x's.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.290
So then if I plug that linear
function into here, I replace

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.420
this linear equation with a new
linear equation with one

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.530
fewer unknown.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.980
if I keep doing that, I just
keep replacing linear

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:55.780
equations with other
linear equations.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.350
When I'm all done, I'm left with
a new linear equation.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:05.030
That's why, if you start with
parts that linear I-V curves,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.230
you'll end up with a straight
line I-V curve.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:12.520
So that idea that the I-V
function is a straight line is

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.380
quite robust.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:18.420
It will happen anytime you go
to circuit out of ideal

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.360
parts-- whereby ideal parts,
I mean Ohm's Law resistors,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.190
voltage sources, and
current sources.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.310
So that has a very interesting
circuit interpretation.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.160
If I know that an arbitrary
circuit can be represented by

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.090
a straight line--

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.680
if the I-V curve can
be represented

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.350
by a straight line--

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.180
well that generates
an equivalent set.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.160
There's obviously more than
one circuit that could

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.960
generate the same
straight line.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.480
Here's a circuit that can
generate that straight line.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.610
In fact, it will always be true
that I can generate a

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:59.870
circuit with one voltage source
and one Ohm's Law

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:05.130
resistor that will mimic the
behavior of any arbitrary

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.630
combination of resistors,
voltage

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.940
sources, and current sources.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.850
All I need to do is think
about, you take the

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:17.170
complicated thing, figure out
its straight line plot, now

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.909
you read off some critical
numbers from this plot.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:25.500
You say, OK, well what if
the current were 0?

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.630
Well if the current were
0, I'd be on this axis.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:34.320
If the current were 0 in the
circuit, V would be V0.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.110
So that means you look over
here, you figure out the

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.020
x-intercept, and the x-intercept
is the value of

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.270
the voltage source.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:52.190
Similarly, if you figure out
the rate of growth of I --

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:57.240
so more generally, if you solve
for I, I will be the

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.110
difference between V and V0
divided by R, that's just

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.540
Ohm's law for the resistor.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.580
And that then lets you figure
out the law for the slope.

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.710
The slope over here is going
to turn out to be one over

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:13.260
this resistor--

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.130
I should have had--
this should be R0,

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.530
these two should match.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:22.170
So the slope of this line is
one over that resistor.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.980
So in general, regardless of
how complicated the box is,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.110
figure out the straight line and
I-V curves, read off the

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:33.070
x-axis, read off the slope, and
that lets you construct a

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.590
simple circuit that has
the same Vi curve.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.390
We call that circuit the
Thevenin Equivalent.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.470
What that means is, you can
think about a complicated

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.980
circuit, regardless of how many
parts, by a circuit it

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.270
just has two.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.620
That's an abstraction that
lets us think more simply

00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:00.230
about complicated circuits even
if there's no buffers.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.990
This is true always.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.650
OK, it's not true--

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.980
it's not it's not the case that
if I change the thing

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.460
that I put here--

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.550
if I change the thing I put
here, this relationship is

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.350
still true.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:20.900
It's the equivalent of Ohm's Law
for complicated circuits.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.010
Ohm's Law is what I get
if what's in the

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.050
box is a single resistor.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.760
If what's in the box is
complicated, more generally

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.170
this is what I get, the
Thevenin Equivalent.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.970
Of course there's lots
of circuits that

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.380
have this I-V curve.

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.320
So a different one is a current

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.490
source with a resistor.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.570
That's called a Norton
Equivalent.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:47.930
You do the same sort of thing.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:52.190
What would happen if here,
if I set V to be 0?

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.030
Well how do I make V be 0?

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.980
I make V be 0 --

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.720
Did I write that on the slide?

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:58.520
no I didn't write
it on the slide.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:01.480
I make V be 0 by putting
a short circuit here.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.220
I connect a wire.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:07.450
If I put a wire here, then
how big is the current I?

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.870
Well if I put a wire here, it's
easier for this current

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.300
to go through the wire
than it is to go

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.600
through that resistor.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.580
So all of this current goes
through the wire.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.800
All of this current is I0.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.570
So if I put a short circuit
across V --

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:34.660
if I make V be 0,
how big is i?

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:36.430
Minus I0 right?

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:38.260
All the current I0
goes through, it

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.140
just goes to backwards.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.400
So that's how I get
this point.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:49.130
So if I wanted to replace some
complicated circuit with a

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:54.830
Norton Equivalent, I would take
the complicated system,

00:37:54.830 --> 00:38:01.270
to figure out the I-V curve,
read off the intercept on this

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:07.030
axis, change the sign--

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.370
that's the most confusing
part, by the way.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.840
This is the error that
you all make.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.460
There's a minus sign in the
current relationship.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:19.370
We like to draw-- it just makes
us feel good to have the

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:22.260
arrow go up.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.420
And if you make the arrow
go up, it's in the wrong

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:30.710
direction to I. So when we did
the Thevenin equivalent, there

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.150
was no sign from it,
this was V0.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:36.700
So the voltage on the voltage
source is equal to the

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.140
x-intercept.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.015
But when we do the Norton, the
current in the current source

00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:46.280
is minus the y-intercept.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.650
Same idea, though.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.250
OK?

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.590
So the idea is that Thevenin and
Norton equivalent circuits

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.150
are equivalent, in the
sense that they

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.200
generate the same voltage.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.160
that the more complicated
circuit did.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.060
So that means for thinking
about the circuit we can

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.580
ignore the complicated stuff,
and just know two numbers, V0

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.486
and R0, or I0 and R0.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:21.060
So one more step, what this all
means is, that if you can

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.180
represent the current voltage
relationship for an arbitrary

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:30.120
circuit in terms of a straight
line, that means that when

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.820
we're trying to characterize
an arbitrary circuit, it

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.580
doesn't matter how complicated
it is.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.480
It could have 100 parts in it.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.830
Regardless of how complicated it
is, I only need to measure

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:46.060
two things in order to fully
characterize it.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.870
If a circuit is made out of
linear resistors, voltage

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.600
sources, and current sources,
three special linear parts--

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.110
if a circuit is composed
entirely out of linear parts,

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.490
doesn't matter how many parts
are in it, there could 100,

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.130
there could be 1,000--

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:05.180
I only need to measure two
things to get a complete

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.610
description.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:09.800
And that's because two points
determine a straight line.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.820
I know, by having proved it by
using linear algebra, I know

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.330
by using linear algebra
that the solution

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:18.530
is a straight line.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.840
I know from geometry
that two points

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:22.160
determine a straight line.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.830
I only need to find
out two points.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:28.250
So by convention, the easiest
two points is usually the

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:29.740
simplest cases.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.530
Set the voltage to 0 and set
the current to be 0.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.810
So that motivates the idea that
if I have an arbitrary

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:41.240
circuit, if I want to figure
out this reduced complexity

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.900
abstraction--

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:45.100
say I want to make a Thevenin
Equivalent--

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.460
what I would do is first to ask
the question, how big is

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.330
the open circuit voltage?

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.210
Open circuit means there's no

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.420
connection between the terminals.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.380
That means the current is 0.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.476
If the current is 0,
I'm on the x-axis.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.610
So over here I'm on the x-axis,
so I'm thinking about

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.000
the red point.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.830
Open circuit over here means
there's no connection here,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.590
which means the current is 0,
and all I need to ask is--

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.960
regardless of how complicated
it is the circuit--

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.100
how big is the voltage that
I would measure here?

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.690
So in this circuit,
if I have a--

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.430
yeah, I confused myself
for a moment.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:37.440
if this current is 0, then
this voltage drop is 0.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.040
This voltage source prescribes
the voltage between these

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.930
nodes to be 1 Volt,
so V0 is 1 Volt.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.710
So I just fell one point.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:53.480
I set I to be 0, I found the
open circuit voltage.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.440
Then I need to find one
other point, because I

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.740
only to find two.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.590
So I'll find the short
circuit current.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.540
Imagine that I put a wire
between the input and the

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:07.230
output, and I'll compute how
much current that circuit

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:09.870
generates in that wire.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.640
Again the only confusing part
is that the reference

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.540
directions are backwards to
the way you might have

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.220
expected them to be.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:20.020
If I put a short circuit here,
then the voltage between these

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.400
nodes is still 1 Volt.

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.540
That's what the voltage
source always says.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.100
So the current that flows
through this wire, the short

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:34.160
circuit current, is just this V
over that R, except it's in

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.410
the negative direction.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:41.320
And the way you can think about
that is that the slope

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:43.460
of this curve has
to be positive.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.710
I need-- because of the
way Ohm's Law works--

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.780
increasing the voltage better
tends to increase the current,

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.090
because that's what Ohm's
Law resistors do.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.230
So I need to have this slope be
positive if it's going to

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.720
be Ohm's Law.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.350
So I characterize just those
two points, and then the

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:04.570
resistance is simply the
ratio of the two.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:07.560
So the resistance is related
to the slope.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.240
It's 1 over the slope,
you don't need

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.380
to worry about that.

00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.250
The resistance is always V over
I, so you just take the

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.900
open circuit voltage and divide
by the short circuit

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.150
current, minus sign, and
you get that the

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.530
resistor must be 2 Ohms.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:23.200
Is that all clear?

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.760
The idea is that we're trying
to build an abstraction that

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.000
lets us simplify the way we
think about circuits, without

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.250
introducing buffers.

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:39.900
So that means then that these
two circuits are equivalent to

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.110
that circuit, in the sense
that they all share

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.110
the same I-V curve.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.640
If you substituted one server
for the other, you couldn't

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.230
tell from outside the red
box which was on the

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:56.970
inside of the red box.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.830
OK so I'll do an example now.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.050
Think about, what if I want
to find the equivalent--

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.620
the Thevenin equivalent
for this circuit.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.200
I just do the things I
just told you to do.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.910
First thing I think about
is, what's the

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:12.535
open circuit voltage?

00:44:12.535 --> 00:44:14.740
So If I think about open
circuit, there's

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.290
no connection here.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.430
That means this current is 0.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.450
That means that the voltage
that develops

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:25.140
is the voltage divider.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.670
So I get 7 and a 1/2 volts--

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.750
3 over (1 plus 3)
times 10, right.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.660
So that gives me one point--

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.620
that tells me the voltage
source for the Thevenin

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:37.940
equivalent.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.580
Then for the second point, I
want to think about the short

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.790
circuit current.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.550
So I consider putting a wire
here, and then I compute the

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.990
amount of current that
flows in that wire.

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:54.610
And in this circuit, this wire
shorts out that resistor, so

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:57.180
all the current goes through
this wire, and none of the

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.720
current goes through
that resistor.

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.450
So that means that the total
current that flows is 10 Volts

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:06.870
divided by 1 Ohm, which
is 10 Amps.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:09.190
And then I know that the
equivalent resistance is the

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.980
ratio of the open circuit
voltage to the short circuit

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.630
current, except I have to worry
about the minus sign.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:19.190
And so I end up with the
equivalent resistance being

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:22.100
the 7.5 Volts, which is the open
circuit voltage, divided

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.760
by 10 Amps, so I get 7.5 Ohms.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.280
And so the answer then, is that
here is the circuit I

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.970
started with, here's the
Thevenin equivalent circuit,

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:33.970
they're identical in the
sense that they have

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.390
the same I-V curve.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.300
And you can just sort of see
why that has to be true.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.020
If you think about, here's the
two circuits, and if you think

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:47.490
about the simple cases, if you
set I to be 0, the voltages

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.590
better be the same.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:52.800
Well over here it's 7.5 by the
voltage divider, over here

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.155
it's 7.5 by the fact that
there's no current going

00:45:55.155 --> 00:45:57.460
through that resistor.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.050
And the short circuit current
better be the same.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.080
So over here, if you short this
out, you're going to get

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.090
10 Amps, over here if you short
it out, you're going to

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:05.160
get 10 Amps.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.550
So you can always go
back and forth.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:09.680
The point is, that you can
substitute the simpler circuit

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.350
for the more complex circuit,
because they have

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.160
the same I-V curve.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:21.120
OK, just to make sure that
you're following me, here's a

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.780
question that has to do with
taking the same circuit, but

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.950
considering the Thevenin
equivalent--

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.980
Thevenin or Norton
equivalent--

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:33.350
at three different ports.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.300
Here I'm thinking about what
would happen if I looked in

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:41.380
terminal A, what if I looked
in terminal B, or looked in

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.640
terminal C?

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.540
Figure out the Thevenin and
Norton parameters, and see if

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.790
there's an error in the table.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.213
So how many errors
are in the table?

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.890
About 50% correct again.

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:22.640
So which entry don't you like.

00:52:25.604 --> 00:52:27.086
AUDIENCE: 2D?

00:52:27.086 --> 00:52:30.060
PROFESSOR: That's exactly
right, so 2D is wrong.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.002
How do I figure out 1A?

00:52:32.002 --> 00:52:35.180
How do I figure out V0
for the a circuit?

00:52:39.784 --> 00:52:43.600
So the definition of V0 is
the open circuit voltage.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:47.220
So I need to figure out, for the
a circuit, how big would

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:51.770
be the voltage across A if there
was no current flowing

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.430
in the leg of A. Everybody
clear on that?

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.510
So the thing that I would do
is, I would think about,

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.470
there's no connection here.

00:52:59.470 --> 00:53:00.440
What's the voltage here?

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.810
So how would I calculate that?

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:03.613
Yeah.

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:06.028
AUDIENCE: You would use the
current-divider relationship

00:53:06.028 --> 00:53:10.616
to figure out that current
flowing through that is going

00:53:10.616 --> 00:53:11.824
to be 4 Amps.

00:53:11.824 --> 00:53:14.722
PROFESSOR: Precisely, so first
I need to take-- here are the

00:53:14.722 --> 00:53:18.065
current sources, so I have two
resistor lengths, so that's a

00:53:18.065 --> 00:53:21.240
perfect set up for the
current divider.

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:25.380
So the amount of current that
goes in this leg compared to

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:30.360
that leg is the ratio of this
resistance to the sum of

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.460
resistances, right?

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.020
And if you work that out, you're
going to get 4 Amps

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.550
coming through here.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.870
So then after you know the
current through this leg, it's

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.700
an easy matter to take the
current and turn it into a

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:48.590
voltage, so the voltage at the
a port is 4 Amps times 5 Ohms

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:49.945
is 20 Volts.

00:53:49.945 --> 00:53:51.195
Is that clear?

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:58.650
And similarly, but with a
different answer, the voltage

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.860
at the B terminal is the same 4
Amps, but now times 10 Ohms.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.040
So that's how we got 40.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.940
And at C, it's the same 4 Amps,
but now it's times the

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.150
sum, 4 times 15 is 60.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:13.630
Everybody's happy about that?

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:18.330
So the point is that when you
generate an equivalent

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.610
circuit, it depends upon which
set of terminals you're using.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:25.050
You can't just take a circuit
and say, give me the Thevenin

00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:25.540
Equivalent.

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:27.040
You have to say, give
me the Thevenin

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.190
equivalent looking somewhere.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.390
So I could look in the A port,
the B port, or the C port, and

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:34.850
I get different V0's.

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.100
How would I compute the I0?

00:54:42.188 --> 00:54:45.182
Short circuit current--

00:54:45.182 --> 00:54:49.370
so what I would do is I
would short this out.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.543
When I do that, all the current
flows in this leg and

00:54:52.543 --> 00:54:55.550
one of the current
flows that leg.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.890
So that means I have,
equivalently, 10 Ohms in

00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.440
parallel with 10 Ohms.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.310
Then by the current divider,
how much current

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:06.230
goes down one leg?

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.480
Half of it.

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:14.380
I get a different answer over
here, because now I short out

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.660
that node, which shorts out that
resistor, so now I get a

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.530
different ratio of resistors.

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:22.880
It's not the same as the first,
so I know that this

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.640
answer can't be 5.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.630
And, in fact, if you work it
out, the answer is 20 over 3.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:38.140
And finally, if you short here,
then you know that that

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:42.600
short circuit shorts out
both this series

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.940
combination and that one.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.270
So all of the 10 Amps goes
through that, so

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:48.790
you get that 10 Amps.

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:52.150
Then how do you get R0, which
is the ratio of V0 over I0.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:58.560
So if you take V0 over
I0, you get 4.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.460
Here if you do right answer, you
get 6, and here if you do

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.840
that you get 6.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.380
The point is, that the Thevenin

00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.680
equivalent you get is different.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.320
The Norton equivalent that you
get is different, depending on

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:12.570
which ports you're looking at.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.980
OK there's two reasons for
thinking about this.

00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:21.820
One--

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.530
so why am I thinking about all
of these equivalent circuits?

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.120
So I wanted to have an
abstraction that was useful

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.950
for thinking about how
parts interact.

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.800
I wanted a way of thinking about
what would happen if I

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:40.300
changed the load on the circuit
without having to

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.920
recalculate all the voltages
and currents

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.100
throughout the circuit.

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.260
And so this Thevenin and
Norton idea is a

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.820
way of doing that.

00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:51.290
That's important from a
practical sense, because when

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:52.660
you buy a part--

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.910
when you buy an electronic part,
they tell you how it

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.940
works by telling you the
Thevenin equivalent or the

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.150
Norton equivalent, or whatever
is the easy way

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.280
to think about it.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:05.030
So there's a practical
reason--

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:07.970
when you buy an op-amp, they
tell you how good the op-amp

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:10.960
is by telling you how big is the
equivalent resistance at

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.370
the output.

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:15.470
So it has a practical value,
because it lets you-- it's the

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:19.020
way you specify an
electronic part.

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:21.910
You can't -- when the
manufacturer makes a part,

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.670
they can't know what you're
going to do with it.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:28.180
So they tell you how it works by
telling you something about

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.030
the equivalent circuit.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:32.480
There's also a different reason
for thinking about

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.110
this, and that is because it's
conceptually simplifying to

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.390
think about Thevenin and
Norton equivalents.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:41.530
So here's an example that's
very much like the first

00:57:41.530 --> 00:57:43.340
problem that I worked out.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.670
What would be the effect
of closing this switch

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:48.770
on the current I?

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:51.990
We solved the problem very much
like this last time, and

00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:55.170
one way you can solve it is you
figure out I in two cases,

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:57.190
when the switch is open and
when the switch is closed.

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.010
And you figure out whether went
up or down, and you know

00:57:59.010 --> 00:57:59.990
the answer.

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:01.910
The point is, that if you think
about this in terms of

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:04.380
equivalent circuits, it's
completely trivial.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:08.730
If I think about what
would happen--

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:12.740
I'm interested in what happens
at I, what I do is split the

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:15.203
circuit into two pieces, the
stuff to the left of I, and

00:58:15.203 --> 00:58:17.070
the stuff to the right to
of I. I make a Thevenin

00:58:17.070 --> 00:58:19.500
equivalent for both of them,
and then I jam together the

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.780
two Thevenin equivalents.

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.230
What I get, in detail,
is showed here.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.240
So if I look left, I see
a 20 Volt source with

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:34.070
a 4, 4, and a 2.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:37.970
That has a Thevenin equivalent
that is showed here, which is

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.670
independent of the state
of the switch.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:43.930
So the same Thevenin occurs on
the two sides, switch open, or

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.070
switch closed.

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:49.040
If i make a Thevenin over here,
there's no sources.

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.670
So it's just going to
be a resistance.

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:54.133
So when the switch is open,
I have to 2 Ohms, when the

00:58:54.133 --> 00:58:55.383
switch is closed,
I have 1 Ohm.

00:58:58.910 --> 00:59:03.620
I don't even need to figure out
what are these part values

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:07.490
to see that, if I make this
resistance smaller, which

00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:12.096
happens if I close the switch,
the current goes up.

00:59:12.096 --> 00:59:15.370
I mean it's true that I showed
here that the Thevenin voltage

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:17.370
is 10 and the Thevenin
resistor is 4.

00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:19.720
I don't even care.

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.760
Regardless of what the
Thevenin voltage was,

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.800
regardless of what the Thevenin
current is, it's

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.270
going to be the same when the
switch is open and closed.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.710
And that's a powerful
statement.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.050
I know it's the same, so when
I close this which, all I've

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:35.990
really done is I've made
that resistor smaller.

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:40.620
The net series resistance is
down, the current is up.

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:43.610
So I have two reasons for
thinking about Thevenin and

00:59:43.610 --> 00:59:44.290
Norton equivalence.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:48.720
One is practical value, the
other is conceptual

00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.760
simplicity.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.440
It lets you simplify way you
think about a circuit, and

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.740
it's a way of gaining intuition
without ever even

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:56.310
solving the equations.

00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:00.120
Most circuit designers don't
solve certain equations.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.020
They know what it's going to do
just by looking at it, and

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.150
this is the kind of reasoning
that they use.

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:10.310
OK, there's one more topic--

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:13.520
the idea of Thevenins and
Nortons really derived from

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.320
linear algebra.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.730
The basic parts of most
interest are linear.

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.710
And when you put together a
system out of linear parts,

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:24.410
you get a linear system.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:28.090
There's one more consequence of
linearity that is terribly

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:32.020
useful, and that's the idea
of super position.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:35.000
If you have a system of
equations that is linear, and

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.710
if you have multiple sources,
things are very simple.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.050
You can see that over here.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:45.310
If I had multiple sources, the
system of equations that I get

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.540
wouldn't look quite like this.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.720
These terms, the constant terms,
they're the ones that

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.810
come from the drives,
the voltage

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.120
sources, the current sources.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.040
So if I had two drives, I would
get something else here.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.790
I would get plus a at
N+1 for example--

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.650
source one, source two.

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:06.471
And I would get source
one, source two.

01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:10.850
So the idea is that, if I have
a system that has multiple

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:16.200
sources, I know from the
structure of the linear

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:20.846
equations, there is just
more constant terms.

01:01:20.846 --> 01:01:22.480
OK, well what's that mean?

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.720
That means you can just use
linear algebra to see that the

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.790
answer to this problem is the
sum of the answers to that

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:33.970
problem plus the answers
to that problem.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:37.050
That's just linear algebra.

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:40.130
What that means in terms of
circuits is, I can figure out

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.640
the response to a circuit
by turning on the

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.590
sources one at a time.

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.360
That's called superposition.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.440
And generally speaking, it's a
lot easier than solving the

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.630
circuit out the long way.

01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:57.180
So here I've got two sources So
say I wanted to compute I,

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.040
in response to V0 and I0.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:05.930
What I would do, is I would turn
off the I0 source, and

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:08.420
calculate the voltage
that results just

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.400
from the voltage source.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.610
That's the same as setting
this to 0 and finding the

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:14.860
response to this.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.820
So if I want to set I to 0, the
way you set I to be 0 is

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.790
open circuit.

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:29.160
If you open circuit something,
there's no current going to

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:30.410
flow through it.

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:34.960
So I replace the current source
with an open circuit,

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.860
and compute the i that would
be result when the current

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:40.970
source isn't there.

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:42.540
OK, well that's easy.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.480
If their current source
we're not there, this

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.500
would be open circuit.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.630
The current, i, would just be
the total voltage going

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.770
through R1 and R2.

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:56.890
So the answer, I1, the first
component of the current I,

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.840
would be V0, the result of the
voltage source divided by the

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.850
sum of R1 and R2.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:03.840
Now that's not the
whole answer.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.580
That would be the whole answer
if I0 weren't there.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.280
So now I have to worry
about the other case.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.810
What if only I0 were there?

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:16.860
Well now I have to
set V to be 0.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.060
Well setting V to 0 is not
open circuiting it.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.806
You can't just reach in, grab
the voltage source, and throw

01:03:22.806 --> 01:03:27.220
it away, because that'll
make the current 0.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.900
If I want the voltage to be 0,
I have to short circuit it.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:35.610
So what I do then, is I leave
the current source alone, and

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:38.030
I replace the voltage source
with a short circuit,

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:41.780
guaranteeing that V is 0.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:46.160
Then I ask, how big is I2, the
component of I that results

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.730
from the current source?

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:52.680
Well if I've short circuited
this, then I just get a

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.200
current divider.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.720
This current has to do with
how readily the current

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.030
divides between R1 and R2.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.170
The amount that goes through the
R1 side is in proportion

01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:07.670
to R2 make R2 bigger, more
of it goes through R1.

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.120
Standard current divider,
except for the

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.370
slippery minus sign.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.960
So if I only had the current
source, the current I2 would

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.150
have been current divider
operating I0 with the slippery

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.280
minus sign.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.770
So that means, by superposition,
that the result

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:29.475
of having both sources on is
just the sum of those answers.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.570
That's a very big
simplification.

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:39.050
If you've got multiple sources
in the circuit, you can think

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.540
about them all at once.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:44.410
And if you really good at
writing linear equations and

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:48.760
solving them with pencils,
you'll get the right answer.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.820
But there's an enormous
simplification if you just

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.950
turn off all but one, and
do them one at a time.

01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:57.680
So here's a problem.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.770
Here's a very simple
circuit, compute V

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:02.940
by using super position.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.350
V is the voltage across
the resistor.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.420
How big would V be if you used
the idea of super position?

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:54.040
So what's the answer?

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:08.010
50% correct, roughly speaking.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.200
OK I want to use
superposition.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.580
So how big would the voltage
v be, if all I had was the

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:14.910
voltage source?

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:15.430
One.

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.000
How big would the voltage
be if i only

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.106
had the current source?

01:07:19.106 --> 01:07:21.510
Ah, got half of you.

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.250
That explains the 50% correct.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.693
How big would the voltage
be, if I only

01:07:25.693 --> 01:07:27.970
had the current source?

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.560
It's tempting to say (1).

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:34.390
I say tempting, because that's
the wrong answer.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.810
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:36.810 --> 01:07:39.530
What is wrong about
the answer (1)?

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:44.464
What does the voltage do
to the current source?

01:07:44.464 --> 01:07:46.776
The voltage due to the current
source is the voltage that the

01:07:46.776 --> 01:07:48.020
current source would have
generated if the voltage

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.730
source weren't there.

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:52.335
If the voltage source weren't
there, then--

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.050
half of you got it right,
so half of you

01:07:57.050 --> 01:07:58.300
can shout the answer.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.600
So if the voltage source weren't
there, the voltage

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.920
source would be 0.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.920
If the voltage source were
0, then V would be 0.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.290
So if the voltage due to the
voltage source is 1, the

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.910
voltage due to the current
source is 0.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:17.310
The sum of the two is 1.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:18.180
The answer is 1.

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:19.899
OK?

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:21.149
Make sense?

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.689
So, very closely related
problem.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:28.510
What's the current I?

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:29.760
Solve that by superposition.

01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:12.800
So how big is the current I
according to superposition?

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:18.244
Wonderful, so how big is the
current i generated by the

01:10:18.244 --> 01:10:21.070
voltage source?

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.892
1.

01:10:22.892 --> 01:10:26.286
How big is the I generated
by the current source?

01:10:26.286 --> 01:10:28.980
Negative 1, the sum is 0.

01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:30.990
All right, so those two problems
were trivial by

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.395
superposition.

01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:33.840
They're not too hard by
non-superposition.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.280
But the point is, that they're
trivial by super position.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.220
So what we saw today--

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.700
the goal for today was to
generate some abstractions

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.730
that let you think about the way
parts interact with each

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:48.480
other, because that's a central
issue when you're

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:51.700
thinking about circuit design
And we built the idea of

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.100
Thevenins and Nortons
and super positions.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.740
That was the basic idea.

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.450
And the sub-theme--

01:10:57.450 --> 01:11:01.450
or maybe I should say the major
theme is really that.

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.110
It's the importance
of linear algebra.

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:07.610
So the take home message is
probably, take 18.06.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:11.250
So this was all about the
application of 18.06 to the

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.230
solving of circuits.

01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.480
See you later.
