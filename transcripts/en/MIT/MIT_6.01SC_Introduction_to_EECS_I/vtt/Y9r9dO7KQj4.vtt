00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.910
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.330
Today I'd like to talk to you
about some notable aspects of

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.660
Python that you'll encounter in
the 6.01 software, as well

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.640
as in the general sense when
working with Python.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.160
A lot of these little tidbits
of Python have some

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.050
interesting history associated
with them, especially related

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.690
to the history of computer
science.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.470
And also, I want to indicate
some things that tend to mess

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.270
up, especially, first time
programmers, but also

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.020
especially people that
are new to Python.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.730
First, I'd like to bring
us back to last week.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.140
We were talking about
object-oriented programming

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.930
and inheritance.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.830
Object-oriented programming
is a programming paradigm.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.750
It's in the same category as
imperative programming or

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.000
functional programming.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.950
And you might say I have a good
sense of the fact that in

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.860
object-oriented programming,
everything is an object.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.780
But I don't really have a good
sense of what constitutes

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.700
imperative programming or
functional programming.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.310
I'm going to focus on functional
programming right

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.820
now, because it has more of a
historic root in the academic

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.810
development of computer
science.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.819
Functional programming is like
object-oriented programming in

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.390
that everything is a function.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.080
It refers to the idea that you
want to write as much of your

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.880
code as possible in a purely
functional manner.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.580
And in particular, you're
looking for the ability to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.740
avoid things like side-effects
or enable many different kinds

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.210
of evaluation.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.160
Those kinds of things are not
the subject of this course,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.910
but I think they're worth noting
to figure out why we're

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.830
bothering learning about things
like lambdas and list

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.760
comprehensions in
the first place.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.210
Speaking of which, the first
thing we need to talk about

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.090
before we even talk about things
like lambdas and list

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.880
comprehensions, is the concept
that in Python,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.440
everything is an object.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
But because functions are
first-class objects, we can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.030
also treat Python to a large
extent like a functional

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.310
programming language.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.160
What do I mean when
I say functions

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.730
are first class objects?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.950
I mean that a function
can be the return

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.410
value of another function.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.550
I mean that the function can be
passed in as an argument to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.400
a function.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
And I mean that functions can be
assigned variable names and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.170
manipulated the same way that we
manipulate any other piece

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.730
of data structure.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.820
This is important, because
if you want higher order

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.840
functions or functions that
actually modify or use other

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.210
functions as a part of you know,
whatever it is they do,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.320
then you need to be able to
interact with the function

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.930
like it's any other object,
in part pass it in

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.900
or return it out.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.480
Let's look at an example.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.290
So let's say I start off with a
very basic function, right?

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.140
If you want to square some
sort of value, probably

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.340
numeric in this case, then
all you have to do is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.180
multiply it by itself.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.860
Pretty simple.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.110
Good place to start.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.160
As a consequence of the idea
that functions are first class

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.420
objects, I can write a function
that takes in a

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.650
function as an argument and
then develops a return

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.980
function that uses the
function that I

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.690
passed in, on itself.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.890
So any arguments that I would
pass to someFunction, I would

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.720
pass into someFunction, take
the return value of this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.100
function call, and then pass
that into someFunction again.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.170
That's what returnFunction
does.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.240
And down here, I return
returnFunction.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.710
Note that the object
type of this

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.060
return value is a function.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.950
So once I have returnFunction,
I can actually pass it

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.400
arguments, have them run through
someFunction, not once

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.550
but twice, and then get out a
value that's of the return

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.900
type of someFunction.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.530
Note that I made some
assumptions while

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.870
writing this function.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.960
First, I've assumed that
someFunction returns out the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.530
same number of arguments, and
either accept an arbitrary

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.880
number of arguments or accepts
the same number of arguments

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.190
as it puts out.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.610
The other assumption that I've
made is that the data type

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.310
that someFunction returns is
the same as the data types

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.140
that someFunction accepts.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.870
Or the things that someFunction
does to its

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.930
arguments can be done to
multiple kinds of arguments.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.430
But that's a whole different
argument.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.990
Right now, we're just focusing
on the fact that we pass in

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.510
some arbitrary number of
arguments, call someFunction

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.990
on it, call someFunction again
on the return value of this,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.520
and return that as something you
can do to whatever it is,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640
someFunction operates on.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.690
OK.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.450
Let's review an example, because
I promise it'll be

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.700
more clear.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.730
Let's say f is going to be the

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.801
composition, a square on itself.

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:59.780
If I do that, I end up with a
function that operates on an

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.030
arbitrary number
of arguments--

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.560
that's not true.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.080
I end up with a copy of square
that takes in the same number

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.750
of arguments as square
called on itself.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.940
So here a square is substituted
for someFunction.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.690
Here a square is called on
that call of square.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.100
And here is what f
is assigned to.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.410
So when I call f of
2, I'm going to

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.520
substitute 2 in for args.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.590
I'm going to call
square on args.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.180
If I call square on
args, I get out 4.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.980
And if I call square on args
again, or if I call square of

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.420
args where args is defined as
the return value of this, then

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.120
I'm going to call square
on 4, I'll square 4,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.370
and I'll get 16.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.310
Take a second to type it into
IDLE, and make it make sense

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.130
to yourself.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.200
All of this code
should compile.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.010
Mess around with the parameters,
if you're having

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.360
trouble convincing yourself
that it does.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.665
Ok.

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:19.660
Now I think we're ready
to talk about lambdas.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.180
If you can pass in functions as
arguments or return them as

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.640
values or assign them to
variable names and just treat

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.300
them like any other data type,
then you should be able to

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.910
treat them as some sort
of raw value.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.180
And that's where lambdas
come in.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.430
Lambda is a key word in Python
that tells you you're about to

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.930
use a function that you have not
given any sort of name or

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.660
defined in any place in your
code or environment

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.190
beforehand.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.910
You're just going to start
talking about something that

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.990
you would like to do to a given
number of arguments, and

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.740
then what you want
to return out.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.720
Lambda has roots in lambda
calculus which, if you're

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.300
familiar with the history of
computer science, you've

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.850
probably heard of.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.070
Now might be a good time to look
up lambda calculus, if

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.730
you've never heard it before
or possibly Alonzo Church.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.960
But it's still available in code
today, which is really

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.610
cool, and speaks to the
continuing power or at least

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.360
recognition of importance of
functional programming.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.460
As I said before, the idea with
lambda is that you could

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.740
write an anonymous function.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:36.260
Over here, in order to write a
function that's squared, I had

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.200
to write out a define line.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.690
And because Python uses
indentation, because in

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.000
Python, indentation carries
meaning, I'd have to enter and

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.012
return over to a next line--

00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:48.730
I'm actually not sure if
that's strictly true.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.620
I think you can do def
square x, return

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.240
x, but I'm not positive.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.210
I've only seen it written
like this.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.810
And I think it's because in the
general sense, people try

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.060
to respect things like
convention and

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.310
readability in Python.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.070
If you're using lambda, people
already know that you want to

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.480
describe a function
really quickly.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.920
Or you want to describe
function without

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.600
assigning it any name.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.270
Therefore, the two most common
uses you'll see of lambda is

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.430
when you want a really fast
function and you don't want to

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.500
spend extra time or lines
writing out that function.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.340
It's pretty clear what
this is going to do.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.020
Or if, in a particular
sense, you need

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.120
an anonymous function.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.380
You don't want to assign
a name or memory space

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.630
associated with that function.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.820
Note instead of using square,
I can just write out this.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.830
So I saved two lines of
code defining square.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.680
And then I don't have to refer
back to some earlier part of

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.890
the code in order to understand

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.570
what this line does.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.520
Pretty cool.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.960
All right.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.650
So there's functions of
first class objects.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.350
There's lambda.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.535
Let's talk about how to
use lambdas on lists.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.770
In Python, you'll end up doing
a lot of list manipulation.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:19.190
One of the best uses of
anonymized functions in any

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.480
functional programming language
is the ability to

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.010
manipulate lists in a line.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.820
If I've defined just a pretty
straightforward list right

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:36.700
here, I can use functions like
map filter and reduce to--

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.150
in one line--

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:42.420
take a list, apply a function to
every element in that list,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:48.020
and then return a copy of
the result of that list.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.060
I didn't have to write a
separate function to do the

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.020
list handling.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.405
I didn't have to write a
separate function to multiply

00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:57.600
the list by two.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.940
And I've communicated what I'm
doing effectively to people

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.190
that are used to functional
programming.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.920
So if you type this line in,
you should end up with a

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.640
return in interactive mode of
every element in this list

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.860
multiplied by two.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.210
Now's a good time to try.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.820
Once you've done that, I also
recommend looking at the

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.750
original copied demolist.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.910
Note that this is unaltered.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:30.080
Map actually returned a new data
structure that represents

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.430
performing this function
on this list.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.910
This becomes important later
when I explain aliasing, but I

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.830
will do that in about
two minutes.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.460
If we want to get even more
elegant, we can use list

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.710
comprehensions.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.990
List comprehensions--

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.030
if you ask somebody where list
comprehensions are from,

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.580
they'll probably say Haskell,
because that is the most

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.370
popular use of list
comprehensions, in terms of

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.450
pure lazy functional
programming.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.990
But it actually goes back
further than that, and is in

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.290
Small Talk, and then something
from the '60s.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.740
I can't remember the name
of it right now.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:30.630
They're really nice because
they borrow a syntactic

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.830
approach from mathematicians.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.600
This looks a lot like
set notation.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.180
And when you read this, you
can probably tell that the

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.000
list listComprehension is going
to describe a set of

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.970
points from 1 to 4.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.980
But you accomplish that in
possibly one line of code.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.080
I've written it on three here
because I wanted to keep it in

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.540
this space.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.790
But it's really concise.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.330
If you type this into IDLE,
you should see the kind of

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.010
list that it returns,
and also what's

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.660
listComprehension is now--

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.910
what now constitutes
listComprehension.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.690
You can use listComprehensions
with functions like map and

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.330
filter and reduce.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.810
And, along with the anonymized
functions, all of these tools

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.890
provide you with a lot of
functionality in a very short

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.140
amount of space.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.280
It's also good to be able to
recognize what's going on when

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.530
you see something like this
or something like this.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.940
Because you'll probably run into
it in, in particular, a

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:46.860
lot with Lisp code, but also in
the artificial intelligence

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.110
community in particular.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.245
Ok.

00:12:52.245 --> 00:12:55.400
We've talked about all that.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.210
Let's take a second to talk
about the fact that lists are

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.710
actually mutable, and what that
means, and what things

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.670
you have to be careful about if
you're going to be working

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.920
with mutable objects.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.640
If you're new to programming,
or you're new to Python,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.020
you've probably already
worked with some of

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.600
these data types, right?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.000
Any numbers, any strings,
any tuples,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.610
are going to be immutable.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:26.920
What that means is if you have
a variable and you have a

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.210
second variable that has a
different assignment line

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.370
associated with it-- right?

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.640
I haven't assigned
g to h here.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.000
I've just signed g to "hello"
and h to "hello."

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.610
If you look at the space in
memory that Python associates

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.000
with both objects, they point
to the same place.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.140
This is the definition of
an immutable object.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.110
When g points to "hello" and h
points to "hello," they both

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.010
point to the same place.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.040
If x points to 5 and y points to
5, they're both pointing to

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.940
the same place.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.120
If you point x at 6,
it now points to a

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.370
different memory address.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.180
This gets confounded
when you're talking

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.940
about mutable objects.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.670
The problem with mutable objects
is that you select a

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.180
memory space to contain the
object or memory ID in Python

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.500
to contain the object.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.090
And then that object is
changed in place.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.290
You can use this to your
advantage but it can

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.120
also mess with you.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.680
And here's how.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.160
Let's say I assigned
a to a small list.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.100
And I also assigned b to a.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.835
b and a now point at
the same place.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.540
If I manipulate b, and I'm--

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.309
excuse me-- still working with
an immutable object, or excuse

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:58.660
me, if I'm still working with
a mutable object, the object

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.100
in that memory address
has been altered.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.740
And b and a still point to
the same place in memory.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.740
So if I look at a, it's going to
look like b, which is going

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.990
to look like 1, 2, 3, 4 --

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.230
which is not what I assigned
a to originally.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.000
Again, can be powerful, but you
have to keep it in mind.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.160
And it might start to mess with,
in particular, the 6.01

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.620
software when you're dealing
with state machines.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.220
In order to get around this, you
can create a copy of the

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.500
list and then modify the copy.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.230
This is actually
what map does.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.610
If you want to do it, the
easiest way to do it on the

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.120
first layer is to specify
the index into the

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.360
list with no bounce.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.770
It'll copy the whole thing.

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:48.430
There's also a Python library
copy or deep copy, if you want

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.890
to copy lists of lists of
lists of lists of lists.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:58.690
And just to clarify, you'll note
that after you assign c

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.780
to a copy of a, c and a occupy
different memory places.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.096
So if you modify c, a will
retain its original value.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.300
I think that's all the
notable things I have

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.250
to say about Python.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.200
and gives us enough power to do
some really powerful list

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.980
manipulation or array
manipulation, and covers what

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.740
we want to say about functional
programming before

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.410
we get into the notion
of state, which I'll

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.660
talk about next time.
