00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.740
PROFESSOR: Last time we talked
about probability as an

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.910
introduction on how to
model uncertainty.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.980
State estimation is one of the
ways that we can deal with

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.130
uncertainty in our system.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.170
We can take a model that we
don't completely understand

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.960
and attempt to infer information
about it based on

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.580
the things that we can observe
about that particular system.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.390
In particular we're going to
look at a set of observations

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.060
and actions that either our
system takes or that we

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.250
observe about the system and
that we take on that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.730
particular system.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.390
If we continue this process for
multiple time steps then

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.310
we can continue to attempt
to learn things about the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.380
particular system.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.770
The process of completing that
behavior over multiple time

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.410
steps while making those
inferences is what we refer to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.695
when we talk about
state estimation.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.040
First off, state estimation is
a process that's completed as

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.610
a consequence of wanting
to understand a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.890
stochastic state machine.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.680
State estimation itself is not
a stochastic state machine.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.060
State estimation attempts to
take a stochastic state

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.970
machine, make a model of that
stochastic state machine, and

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.970
then run state estimation on it
iteratively to attempt to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.180
figure out, or recursively, an
attempt to figure out what's

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.580
going on inside that stochastic
state machine.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.870
When you build a stochastic
state machine model there are

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.880
three components that need
to be specified.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.180
The first is the starting
distribution over states.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.970
For instance, let's say that I
believe that I am sick and I'm

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.350
trying to figure out what it
is that I am sick with.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.490
And I could be sick
with three things,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.380
as far as I'm concerned.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.950
I could be sick with strep or
I could be sick with some

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.820
other more boring virus.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.250
Or I could be sick with
mononucleosis.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.270
The starting distribution refers
to my starting belief

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.390
as to the systems.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.570
And if I'm generically sick in
the general sense, one of the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.360
assumptions that's frequently
made with respect to starting

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.930
distributions is that they're
uniform, right?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.370
It could be equally any
of these things.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.340
The second thing you need to
specify when you're talking

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.120
about modeling a stochastic
state machine is your

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.630
observation distribution.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.350
Or what is the likelihood
associated with making a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.510
particular observation
given that you're

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.970
in a current state?

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.990
For instance, if I have
mononucleosis how likely would

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.720
it be that I observe a bunch of
white ugly patches on the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.740
back of my throat?

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.290
Or if I had strep?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.650
What is the likelihood
associated with that?

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.670
That kind of thing.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.320
Typically this observation
variable is factored into a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.570
couple different phenomena.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.980
In the sick example
the best thing to

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.230
talk about is symptoms.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.890
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.280
Am I lethargic?

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.403
Do I have the white spots on
the back of my throat?

00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:57.880
Do I have a fever?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.130
That sort of thing.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.460
The last thing that you need
specify when you're talking

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.400
about modeling a stochastic
state machine is your

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.500
transition distribution.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.010
You assume that your state
machine is going

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.100
to change over time.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.470
Or it is likely that I will
get more or less sick.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.150
And there are things that
I can do to induce

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.010
that kind of change.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.450
Or there are things that I can
do that effectively model the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.700
passage of time.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.220
Your actions for a stochastic
state machine model can either

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.170
be actions that the model takes
and you were exclusively

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.480
doing observations.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.330
But one of the particular
observations that you do also

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.990
qualifies as an action or
something that indicates the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.580
passage of time.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.180
Or actions can be something
that you do to

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.140
a particular state.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.280
In the sick example, things I
could do to myself to try to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.970
make myself feel better or at
least figure out better what

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.670
is going on or what might cause
my distribution to sway

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.010
towards one particular state.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.020
I could take antibiotics.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.990
Or sleep in and drink a
lot of orange juice.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.600
Or continue my day as normal.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.340
Given a particular action, any
particular state that you're

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.980
starting from, your transition
distribution tells you the

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.350
likelihood associated
with being in a

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.200
new particular state.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.190
So as a consequence of making
those actions, does the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.045
distribution of likelihood of
a particular illness change?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.670
At this point I'm going to walk
through a step of state

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.870
estimation.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.620
Each step of state estimation
is the same.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.390
In fact, if you complete
multiple steps based on the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.680
information that you gained from
the previous step, that's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.660
referred to as recursive
state estimation.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.305
And I'll keep walking through
the sick example.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.310
So when you're doing state
estimation you're trying to

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.190
figure out something about
a system that you cannot

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.310
perfectly model.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.100
For instance, either your own
immune system or your own

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.190
susceptibility to a particular
disease.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.660
And you have all the components
you have for your

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.960
stochastic state
machine model.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.850
As a consequence of the passage
of time or as a

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.580
consequence of making an
observation and either

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.400
observing an action taken by
your stochastic state machine

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:20.840
or performing an action upon
your stochastic state machine

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.930
you're going to make a new
estimation of what you believe

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.680
the current state of that
unknown system.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.570
Or system that is not completely
observable to you.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.930
You're going to make a new
estimate of your belief of the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.180
state of that system.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.810
In short you're going to solve
for the probability

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.820
distribution over
S_(t plus 1).

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.860
There are two steps.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.140
The first step is referred
to as the

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.600
Bayesian reasoning step.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.880
And it involves performing Bayes
evidence or Bayes rule

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:08.550
upon the current state
distribution given a

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.610
particular observation.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.140
So at this point I've
made some sort of

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.430
observation about myself.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.280
If I'm talking about the
sick model, right?

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.580
I spent all day coughing.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.090
Or I have a fever.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.040
Or my throat is sore.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.070
Or I feel extremely
lethargic, right?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.860
Given that observation I can
take the P(O given S) from my

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.680
observation distribution
multiply it by my current

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.620
understanding of the
state distribution.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.870
And then divide out by P(O).

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.120
The slowest way to complete this
action is to build the

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.890
joint distribution and
then condition on

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.710
a particular column.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.580
It's very proper.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.640
But you can save yourself some
cycles by doing this.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.930
Let's say I started off
with the uniform

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:09.630
distribution, right?

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.560
It could be equally likely that
I have strep or a normal

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.080
virus or mono.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.860
As a consequence of making the
observation that I don't have

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.460
white spots on the back
of my throat.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.600
I could say, oh the likelihood
of me being in that state--

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.930
the likelihood of me just
having a normal virus is

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.070
higher and the likelihood of me
having either strep throat

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.510
or mono is lower.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:56.960
This step takes P(S) and
multiplies it by P(O given S).

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:11.460
o Once I have these values I
have to scope back out to the

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.540
universe or I have to normalize
these values such

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.790
that they sum to 1.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.830
That's where I get my
P(S_t given O).

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.930
At this point I've accounted for
the observation that I've

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.730
made, but I haven't accounted
for the action on the system.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.090
That's the next step.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.780
We're going to take our results
of Bayesian reasoning

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.760
which are sometimes referred
to as B prime S_t.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:52.140
And take the action and find the
distribution overstates as

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.590
a consequence of a single time
step or a single iteration of

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.530
state estimation.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.595
The second step is referred
to as a transition update.

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.130
We've got our updated belief.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.890
We're going to take our
transition distribution or our

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.000
specification for what happens
given that we're in a current

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.030
state and an action
has been taken.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.840
At that point we'll have a
probability distribution over

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.070
the new states.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.540
And here are my values
from the first step.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.790
As an example let's say that I
sleep in and drink a lot of

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.360
orange juice.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.490
As a consequence of sleeping
in and drinking a lot of

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:52.870
orange juice there's some amount
of likelihood that I

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:57.510
will either continue to be
sick with strep or it's

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.970
possible that I actually have
just a normal virus.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.340
If I have a normal virus and I
sleep in and drink a lot of

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:08.530
orange juice, this causality
sounds backwards but it's as a

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.600
consequence of not being able
to make perfect observations

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.850
on the system.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.180
If I have an amount of belief
that says that I think I have

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:31.090
strep and I sleep in and drink
a lot of orange juice, then

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:35.510
it's equally likely that I will
have either strep or a

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.310
normal virus after completing
that step, right?

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.510
It doesn't differentiate
between the two.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.730
If I'm sick with a virus and I
sleep in and drink a lot of

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:57.030
orange juice, then the state
that I'm going to encourage

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.200
myself to be in is
I have a virus.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.870
If I have mono and I sleep in
and drink a lot of orange

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.890
juice then there's some
likelihood on the next day

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.470
that I will still be
in a state that

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:13.990
looks like I have mono.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.970
But there's also some likelihood
associated with it

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.720
that I will be in some state
that looks like I have strep.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.696
That's what happens when you
run the transition update.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.470
When you run the transition
update you end up accumulating

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.930
all the probabilities associated
with being in a

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.730
particular new state.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.780
As a consequence of being in a
particular previous state and

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.000
entering that new state based
on the transition

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.860
distribution.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.730
Once you accumulate all these
values you end up with your

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.270
new distribution over
a new state.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.660
This represents one step
of state estimation.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.940
If I wanted to run multiple, I
would take the value that I

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.290
got here for S_(t plus
1), replace it in

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.870
the value for S_t.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.890
And run the same process of
Bayesian reasoning and

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.800
transition update.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.560
This concludes my review
of state estimation.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.810
Next time we'll talk
about search.
