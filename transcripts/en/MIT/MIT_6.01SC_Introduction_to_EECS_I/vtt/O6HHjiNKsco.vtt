00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:06.830
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.900
Today I'd like to talk to about
a new module called

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.140
Signals and Systems.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.280
Our previous module on
programming, we focused on

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.710
object-oriented programming
and state machines as

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.350
different methods by which
we could model

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.790
the physical world.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.100
In this module we're going to
talk about a new way to model

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070
the physical world called
the discrete linear

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.140
time-invariant system.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.320
You might say, Kendra, why do
I need to do that, or why

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.620
would I move away from
state machines.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.590
I seem to be able to model

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.850
everything using state machines.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.200
The short answer is, you want
to be able to move away from

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.450
state machines, because
you want to be able

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610
to predict the future.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.645
But I'm not really going to be
able to get to how you're

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:42.250
going to be able to predict
the future until

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.890
two videos from now.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.680
So for now we'll introduce
discrete linear time-invariant

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920
systems and also talk about
different knowledge

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.000
representations you might
encounter them in, so that you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.200
recognize them when you see them
and can manipulate them

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.670
as needed to talk to other
people about them.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.920
Let's go to the board.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920
Last time we talked about
state machines.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.560
We're able to use them to model
pretty much any system.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.980
We can model the evolution of a
particular process over time

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.010
using a record of all previous
inputs and outputs and

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.780
possibly previous states, if we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.650
included that in our output.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.900
But the problem with state
machines is that they, like

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.810
most programming, encounter
the halting problem.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.460
At some point your program can
reach a little complexity at

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660
which you cannot determine what
it's going to do without

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.710
actually just running it and
seeing what happens.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.170
This is great for researchers.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.530
This is the method by which
people go out and have to find

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.630
something or discover something
instead of being

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.140
able to like, simulate
it using a machine.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.260
But if you want to be able to
promise things to other people

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.730
or predict what's going to
happen, then it helps if you

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.310
can model something that has a
high level of complexity by

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.130
abstracting away the complexity
and interacting

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.190
with it as though it has
features that indicate that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.580
it's going to behave in
a particular way.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.020
So if you want to make a control
system that does a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.110
particular thing, or look at
an existing system and say,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.790
well, I know that your power
plant's going to blow up in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.200
five years, because of this,
it helps if you have some

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.660
understanding of particular
classes of systems and what

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
kind of long term behaviors
those particular classes of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.090
systems generate.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.650
And that's why we look
at discrete LTI.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.480
It's a particular class
of system --

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.150
in particular discrete LTI is
what we're going to look at in

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.230
6.01 because it's
fairly simple.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.200
But once you've learned how to
deal with the system in that

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.560
manner, you can use the skills
that you've learned there to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.590
approach more complex feedback
problems or more complex

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.840
control problems.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.430
First, an incredibly brief
review of linear

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.680
time-invariant systems.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.700
When you're talking about a
linear time-invariant system,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.590
both the inputs and the outputs
are going to be real.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
We're not going to deal with
the complex plane at all.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.090
If you were to model your LTI
system using a state machine,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.740
that state machine would be
dependent on a fixed amount of

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.240
previous inputs, outputs
or states.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.730
You give some amount of leeway
for start state or the fixed

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.900
number of states before you get
to your fixed amount of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.250
data structure that represents
your current state.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.840
But if you're running a linear
time-invariant system, the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.200
amount of information that you
need to figure out your state

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.260
in a long term sense is always
finite and fixed.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.130
In terms of functional
expressions, you've probably

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.180
seen these associated with
linear time-invariant systems.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.200
Know that this also means that
you can represent linear

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.280
time-invariant systems as
additions or scalar

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.440
multiplications of your
existing function.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.800
So that's out of the way.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.310
These are all true of LTI.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.190
We're going to focus
on discrete LTI.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.760
One, because we can use
a discrete state

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.220
machine to model it.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.180
And two, because it
makes it easier to

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.720
represent using computers.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.550
Once you've got that digital
abstraction, you don't have to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.620
worry about having access to a
truly continuous function.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.006
All right.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:34.460
Now that you know what we're
going to talk about, how do

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.730
you talk about it
to other people?

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.310
Here are the different
representations that you might

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.150
see a discrete linear
time-invariant system in.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.630
One of them is called a
difference equation.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.640
And you've probably encountered
this in one of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.890
your math classes.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.320
It says that you're going to
take a sample from a signal y

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.530
at some sort of given time
step, typically n.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.030
And when you're writing out
a difference equation that

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.760
represents an entire system, you
usually see y of n on one

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.050
side on the left, and then
everything that represents the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.580
functional component on the
system on the right, which in

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.760
this case determines what
determines the output

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.280
at every time step.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.270
In this very particular case,
we're talking about an

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.940
accumulator, which means that at
every time step the output

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.520
is determined by the input
plus the previous output.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.020
So at every time step we take
the input and whatever it is

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.280
we were outputting before
and output it again.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.970
Pretty straightforward.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.050
If somebody described to you a
difference equation in words,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.120
you could probably turn it into
a equation at this point.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.880
Note that even though there are
variables associated with

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.080
these samples, they are still
very particular samples.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.740
And the thing that you're
interested in is probably not

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.760
even the samples at all.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.010
It's the relationship between
the samples, when they were

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.130
sampled, and relative to one
another, and how that relates

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.720
to the output at a
given time step.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.520
If you then want to talk about
an entire signal, then you can

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.080
use an operator equation.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.730
And you'll probably see these
things when you do any sort of

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.245
research on control theory
or feedback.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.700
Instead of representing the
sample of the signal y at a

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.220
given time n, we're just going
to talk about the overall

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.715
signal capital Y. Likewise,
instead of talking about x at

00:06:28.715 --> 00:06:31.830
a given time n, we're going to
talk about the signal capital

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.410
X.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.820
Remember that I said that the
most important part of this

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.530
equation is the fact that
there's a different

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.390
relationship between these two
signals and when you were

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.640
sampling from them.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:53.080
When we want to represent this
relative delay, we represent

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.310
it using an R. And in
particular, I want to note the

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:06.940
fact that the degree of R
represents the amount of delay

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.250
associated with the sample
from a particular signal.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:19.020
So if I wanted to make this n
minus 2, I would reflect that

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:28.137
change in my operator equation
by changing the degree of R.

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:30.110
And because we're working with
a linear time-invariant

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.900
system, if we wanted to scale
this by 2, it'd be the same as

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.730
scaling this by 2, et cetera.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.390
Now I can talk about signals.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.910
What if I want to talk about a
physical manifestation of the

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.500
relationship between these
signals, and/or what if I want

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.480
to use something kind of like
circuit diagrams to talk about

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.630
what kind of signal manipulation
I'm going to do?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.600
This is where block
diagrams come in.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.720
Block diagrams are incredibly
PowerPoint-friendly.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.370
Block diagrams mean that
everybody is on the same page,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.510
because all you have to do
is trace out the arrows.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.030
Block diagrams mean you're going
to do a combination of

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.120
gains, delays and adders to
visually represent the

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.160
relationship between your output
signal and any input

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.280
signals that you have.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.830
Up here I have actually
drawn an accumulator.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.500
And it's got a box around
it, which will be

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.500
relevant in two minutes.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.559
But right now you
can ignore it.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.820
I've got my input signal,
or my input signals, are

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.590
typically on the left.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.370
And the progression of gains,
delays and adders associated

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.320
with the block diagram represent
the relationship

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.780
between the input signals
and the output signal.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.350
And then I'll have my output
signal on the right.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.570
Most people indicate flow with
arrows, in part to make things

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.590
easier to read.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.580
But typically, you only need
the arrow indicating where

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.080
you're sampling from and
what your output's

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.330
going to look like.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.800
In this case in order to get Y,
and in the general sense, I

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.670
can backtrace from the signal
that I'm interested in through

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:29.820
my diagram and figure
out what values I'm

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.640
actually interested in.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.990
So in this particular case, Y
is a linear combination of X

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.710
and whatever this represents,
which is RY.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:56.900
If I did want to put a 2 here,
I've been talking about gains,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.300
delays and adders, but
this diagram doesn't

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.220
contain a gain yet.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.140
So let me show you how you
would include a gain.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.770
Gains are typically represented
by the value of

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.240
the gain inside an arrow.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.540
It looks like an op-amp from
schematic diagrams.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.790
We'll get to those later
in circuits.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.330
It's not essential that the
arrow point in the direction

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.480
of flow, but people might look
at you funny if you don't put

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.140
it in the direction of flow.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.160
And the other thing that I think
I want to note here is

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:43.750
that if you see a minus sign
here, it means X minus 2RY,

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.800
which is the same as putting a
negative value on your gain.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.340
So right now, we're back
to X plus 2RY.

00:10:55.908 --> 00:10:57.390
OK.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.440
We've got to block diagrams.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.400
You might be saying at this
point, Kendra, what are block

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.900
diagrams good for other than
PowerPoint presentations and

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.440
possibly arguing with my friends
over what's going on.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.250
And I say, they're really
good for abstraction.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.050
I could draw a box around this
and abstract it away into a

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.280
function and say, if I put
something into this box, and I

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.480
want to get something out where
the action that happens

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.450
in here is identical to this
schematic, then I can find an

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.310
equation that actually
represents that operation.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.740
And the way I do that is I'm
going to take my operator

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:55.840
equation and solve in particular
for Y over X. In

00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:01.430
this case, with the 2, Y
over X is going to be 1

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.750
over (1 minus 2R).

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:19.080
Note that if H is equal to the
expression Y over X, and I

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:27.380
multiply H by X, I get out Y.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.490
This concludes my coverage of
motivations for learning about

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.410
discrete LTI systems and also
the different representations

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.760
that we will want to use when
talking to other people about

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.240
discrete LTI.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.720
At this point we can also start
talking about how we get

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.780
to the point where we can start
predicting the future.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.260
And then in the video after
that I'll actually start

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.510
talking about poles.
