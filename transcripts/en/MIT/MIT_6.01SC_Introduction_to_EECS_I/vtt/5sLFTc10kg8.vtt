00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.785
PROFESSOR: So today I want to
start a new topic, circuits.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.130
No, that's good.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.390
That's good.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.662
Circuits are good.

00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:34.590
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.280
PROFESSOR: Thank
you, thank you.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.880
Much better.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.290
So just to provide some
perspective, I want to remind

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.500
you where we are, how we got
here, and where we're going.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.170
So at the beginning of the
course, we promised that there

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.830
were several intellectual
themes that

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.400
we would talk about.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.850
Probably the most important
one there is

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.450
designing complex systems.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.000
That's what we're
really about.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.920
We would like you to
be able to make

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.670
very complicated systems.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.220
How do you think about parts?

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.040
How do you think about
connecting them?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.730
How do you think about things
when you want to make

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.170
something that's very
complicated?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.740
Part of that is modeling.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.510
We just finished a module
on modeling.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.550
So in order to make a complex
system, we'd like to be able

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.850
to predict how it will behave
before we completely build it.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.220
Sometimes it's impossible
to build the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.670
entire system before.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.030
Sometimes it's impossible
to build prototypes.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.190
Sometimes you're stuck with
going with the design at

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.270
launch, and figuring
out how it works.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.340
In those cases in specific, it's
very important to be able

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.850
to model it, to have some
confidence that the thing's

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.500
going to work.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.090
We're going to talk about
augmenting physical systems

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.990
with computation.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.320
That's the module we're
about to begin.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.060
And we'll conclude by talking
about how to build systems

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.900
that are robust to change.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.240
So we started with the idea
of, how do you make

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.320
complicated systems?

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.840
And we introduced this notion
of primitives, combination,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
abstraction, and pattern in
terms of software engineering.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.600
We did that because that's the
simplest possible way of

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.350
getting started.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.810
It provided a very good
illustration of PCAP at the

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.650
low level by thinking about
Python, by thinking about the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.330
primitive structures that Python
gives you, how those

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.830
can be combined, how you can
abstract, how you can

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.450
recognize patterns.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.120
But then we also built a higher
level abstraction,

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.130
which was the state
machine idea.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.110
There the idea was you didn't
have to have state machines in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.140
order to build the brain for a
robot, but it actually turns

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.430
out to be easy if you
do because there's

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.530
a modularity there.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.550
You can figure out if each part
works independent of the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.530
other parts.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.510
And then you can be pretty sure
when you put it together

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.750
the whole thing's
going to work.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.810
So that was kind of our
introduction to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.570
this notion of PCAP.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.820
Then we went on to think about
signals and systems.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.730
And that was kind of our
introduction to modeling.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.070
How do you make a model
of something

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.690
that predicts behavior?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.890
So we transitioned from thinking
about, how do you

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.940
structure a design to how do
you think about behavior.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.350
Today we're going to start
to think about circuits.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.240
Circuits are really going to a
more primitive physical layer.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.210
How do you think about actually
making a device?

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.460
So the device that we'll think
about is a thing to augment

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.350
the capabilities --

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.340
the sensor capabilities
of the robot.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.490
We'll think about making a
light tracking system.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.420
And the idea is going to be
that you'll build a head.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.480
The head has a neck, so you'll
have to control the neck.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900
The head has eyes.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.250
It will mount on top of the
robot, and that'll let you

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.960
drive the robot around
looking for light.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.120
And you'll do that by
designing a circuit.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.200
So that's kind of the game plan
for the next three weeks.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.020
So today, what I want to do
is introduce the notion of

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.570
circuits, introduce
the theory for how

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.400
we think about circuits.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.100
And then in the two labs this
week, the idea will be to

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.410
become familiar with the
practice of circuits.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.750
How do you actually
build something?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.780
How do you actually make
something work?

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.990
So today's the theory.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.390
So the theory, the idea in
circuits is to think about a

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.070
physical system as the
interconnection of parts and

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.650
rules that connect them.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.180
In fact, the rules fall
into two categories.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.490
We're going to think about the
currents that go through parts

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.410
and the voltage that develops
across parts.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.140
And we'll see that there's a
way of thinking about the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.310
behavior of the entire circuit
that integrates all of those

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.160
three pieces.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.670
How does the part work?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.640
How do the currents that go
through the part work?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.750
And how do the voltages
that are produced

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.710
across the part --

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.820
how do they work?

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.880
So I'll just start with two
very simple examples.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.735
The first is the most trivial
example you can think about.

00:05:11.735 --> 00:05:14.750
You can think about a flashlight
as a circuit.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.700
You close the switch,
current flows.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.450
Very simple idea.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.100
We will make a model of that
that looks like this.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.600
We'll think about the battery
being a source.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.640
In this case, a voltage
source.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.020
We'll think about the light
bulb being a resistor.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.020
We'll have two parts.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.480
We'll have to know the
current-voltage relationships

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.880
for both of the parts.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.670
And we'll have to know the
ramifications for those

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.400
currents and voltages when
you put them together.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.620
Very, very simple.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.330
The other simple example that
I want to illustrate is this

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.790
idea of a leaky tank.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.600
Here the idea that I want to get
across is that the circuit

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.810
idea is quite general.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.770
When we talk about circuits,
we almost always talk about

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.220
electronic circuits.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.400
But the theory is by no means
limited to electronics.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.870
So for example, if we think
about a leaky tank, we think

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.840
about a pipe spewing water
into a reservoir.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.730
Maybe that's the Cambridge
Reservoir.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.680
Maybe that's the water coming
out of the Woburn Reservoir.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.120
Maybe that's the demand put on
by the Cambridge people trying

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.310
to take showers in
the morning --

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.830
I don't know.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.160
So we think about flow
into a tank, a

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.880
reservoir, and flow out.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.790
And we can make a model for that
in terms of a circuit.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.220
In the circuit there
are through

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.370
variables and across variables.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.510
In an electronic circuit, the
through variable is current.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.000
Here the through variable
is the flow rate.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.420
So it's the flow of water in
and the flow of water out,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.990
represented here
by these things

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.840
that look like currents.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.000
And the across variable for an
electronic device is voltage.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.870
The across variable for this
kind of a fluidic device, the

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.180
across variable is pressure.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.520
So we think as this thing gets
ahead of that thing, as

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.720
there's more stuff coming in
than going out, the height

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.870
goes up and the pressure
builds.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:06.690
Same idea.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.070
So the point is that we'll
develop the theory for

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.260
circuits in terms
of electronics.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.640
But you should keep in the back
of your mind that it's a

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.980
lot more general idea than
just electronics.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.070
In fact, there are two
completely distinct reasons

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.660
why we even bother
with circuits.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.120
One is that they're very
important to physical systems.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.430
If you're designing a power
network, of course you have to

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.170
think about the way the power
network, the power grid works

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.130
as a circuit.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.430
That's obvious.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.950
In electronics, of course, if
you're going to build a cell

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.090
phone, you have to know how
the parts interconnect

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:40.710
electronically.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.750
That's obvious.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.540
But probably the biggest use for
circuits these days is not

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.800
those applications, although
those are very important.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.720
Circuits are also used
as models of things.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.360
So many models for complex
behaviors are in

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.820
fact circuit models.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.760
So in terms of electronics, the
idea is that we want to

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.100
get on top of electronics.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.240
We want to understand how
circuits work, so we can

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.170
understand things like that.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:16.110
If you look at how complex
processors have got over my

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.970
professional life, we start with
my professional life down

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:25.090
at about 1,000 transistors
per processor.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.990
And today, we're up at
about a billion.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.420
That's enormous.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.380
Even in the stone ages when we
were designing things that had

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:41.549
a thousand parts, we still had
trouble thinking about those

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.070
thousands parts all at once.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.790
We still need PCAP.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:48.040
We still needed ways of
combining the activities of

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.340
many things into a conceptual
unit that was bigger.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:57.030
Here, it's just impossible
if you don't have that.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.760
So that's one of the reasons
we study circuits.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.390
And the other reason is here.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.680
So here I'm showing a
model for the way

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.800
a nerve cell works.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.860
This model is taken
from 6.021.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.280
The idea, this comes from the
study of the Hodgkin-Huxley

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.810
model for neural conduction,
arguably the most successful

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.020
mathematical theory
in biophysics.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.510
Which explains the completely
non-trivial relationship

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:33.260
between how the parts from
biology works and the behavior

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:37.460
in terms of propagated action
potentials works.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.500
So the idea is that we
understand how this biological

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.740
system works because
we think about it

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.470
in terms of a circuit.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.430
That's the only successful way
we have to think about that.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.430
So what I want to do then is
spend today figuring out

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.650
circuits At the very most
primitive level.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.330
The level that I'm going to
talk about in terms of

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.530
circuits is roughly analogous
to the level that we talked

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.020
about with Python when we were
thinking about how Python

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.590
provides utilities for
primitives, combinations,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.260
abstractions, and patterns.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.220
So I'm going to start at the
very lowest level and think

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.290
about, what are the basic
primitives, the smallest units

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:25.740
we'll ever think about
in terms of circuits?

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.450
And what are the rules by
which we combine them?

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.090
So I'll start with the very
simplest ideas, the very

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.020
simplest elements.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.720
We will oversimplify things
and think about the very

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.010
simplest kind of electronic
elements as resistors that

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.640
obey Ohm's Law, V equals iR.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.610
Voltage sources, things that
maintain a constant voltage

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.740
regardless of what you do.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.290
And current sources, things
that maintain a constant

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.810
current regardless
of what you do.

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.640
These things are, as I said,
analogous to the primitive

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.890
things that we looked
at in Python.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.750
They're also analogous to the
primitive things that we

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.470
looked at in system functions.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.900
Can somebody think of, when
we were doing difference

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.880
equations, what were the
primitives that we

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.680
started with --

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.770
when we started to study
difference equations?

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.260
What's the most primitive
elements

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.510
that we thought about?

00:11:20.937 --> 00:11:22.320
AUDIENCE: Delay.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.340
PROFESSOR: Delay, yeah.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.740
So we thought about
things like--

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.640
so we had delay.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.600
Anything else?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.330
AUDIENCE: Gain.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.300
PROFESSOR: Gain.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.550
Anything else?

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:40.960
Add.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.130
So we had exactly three
primitives.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.850
And we got pretty far with
those three primitives.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.000
We learned the rules for
interconnection.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.340
We didn't really make a
big deal out of it.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.320
We didn't formalize it, but the
rules for interconnection

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.430
were something like
every node has to

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.810
have exactly one generator.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.830
You can't connect the
output of this to

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.890
this, that's illegal.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.220
Every node has to
have one source.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.010
And every node can source
lots of inputs.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.050
That was kind of the rules
of the interconnect.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.505
The interconnects here will be a
little bit more complicated.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.960
So those are the elements
that we'll think about.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.370
And the first step's going to be
to think about, how do they

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.800
interconnect?

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.160
The simplest possible
interconnections are trivial.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.580
In the case of the battery, you
hook up the voltage source

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.280
to the resistor.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.100
The voltage source makes
the voltage across

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:37.220
this resistor 1 Volt.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.910
If we say the resistor is 1
Ohm, then there's 1 Amp

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:40.745
current period.

00:12:40.745 --> 00:12:41.510
Done.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.750
Easy.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.160
Similarly, if we were to hook
up the resistor to a current

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.120
source, we would get something
equally easy.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.060
Except now the current source
would guarantee that the

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:56.450
current through the resistor
is an amp.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.360
Therefore, the voltage across
the resistor, by Ohm's law,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.700
would be a Volt.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.830
So we would end up with the same
solution for a completely

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.940
different reason.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.340
Here the voltage
is constrained.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.590
Here the current's
constrained.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:16.090
Just to make sure everybody's
with me, figure out, what's

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.450
the current i that goes
through this resistor?

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.040
Slightly more complicated
system.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.120
Take 20 seconds, talk to your
neighbor, figure out a number

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.820
between (1) and (5).

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.690
OK, so what's the answer?

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.630
Everybody raise your hand with
a number (1) through (5).

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.980
Come on, everybody vote.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:29.920
Come on.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.020
You can blame it on your
neighbor, that's the rules.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.790
You talk to your neighbor,
then you can blame dumb

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.150
answers on your neighbor.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:41.100
OK, about 80% correct I'd say.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.410
So how do you think
about this?

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.450
What's going to be
the current?

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.420
How would you calculate
the current?

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.670
What do I do first?

00:15:48.462 --> 00:15:48.930
Shout.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.772
If you shout, and especially
if my head's turned away I

00:15:52.772 --> 00:15:55.260
don't know who you are.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.200
AUDIENCE: Kirchhoff's law.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.240
PROFESSOR: Kirchoff's
law, wonderful.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.717
Which one?

00:15:57.717 --> 00:16:00.102
There's two of them.

00:16:00.102 --> 00:16:02.964
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:16:02.964 --> 00:16:04.130
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.663
What loop do you want to use?

00:16:05.663 --> 00:16:06.430
AUDIENCE: Left.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.220
PROFESSOR: Left side.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.960
So if we use the left side loop,
we would conclude that

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.310
there's a volt across
the resistor.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.288
So the current would be?

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:16.764
AUDIENCE: 1 Amp.

00:16:16.764 --> 00:16:17.748
PROFESSOR: An amp.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:21.684
Where's the current come from?

00:16:21.684 --> 00:16:23.160
AUDIENCE: The voltage.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:28.080
PROFESSOR: The voltage source
just like before.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.880
So not quite.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.210
So the voltage source
establishes this

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.710
voltage would be 1.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.850
That makes this current be 1.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.220
That would be consistent with
the current coming out of

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.250
here, except we have to also
think about that 1 Amp source.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.780
So the question is, what's
does the 1 Amp source do?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.370
Nothing?

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.240
It's just there sort of
for decoration or for

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] so that we
can make an interesting

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.580
question to ask in lecture?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.830
Maybe.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.040
So where's the current?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.689
Where's the 1 Amp that
goes through the

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:05.184
resistor come from?

00:17:05.184 --> 00:17:07.180
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
on the right.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.176
PROFESSOR: It comes
from the right.

00:17:09.176 --> 00:17:11.080
It comes from the current
over here.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.130
So the idea is that if this
current, ignore the voltage

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.150
over here for the moment.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.560
If this current flowed through
the resistor, then you'd have

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.130
1 Amp going through there, and
you'd have 1 Volt generated by

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.069
that current which just happens
to be exactly the

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:25.900
right voltage to match
the voltage

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.930
from the voltage source.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.640
So if you think about this, the
voltage guarantees that

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.720
this is 1 Volt, but so
does the current.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.980
In order to simultaneously
satisfy everything, all you

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.310
need to do is have all of this
current go around and come

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.240
down through that resistor.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.070
That will generate the volt, so
there's no propensity for

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.020
more current to flow out of the
source because the source

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.580
is 1 Volt and it's facing a
circuit that's already 1 Volt.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.310
So the idea was to try to give
you something that's

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.260
relatively simple that you can
think through on your own, but

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.530
not trivial.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.060
So the answer was 1 Amp.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.870
But the 1 Amp was not for
the trivial reason.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:10.280
The 1 Amp is because the current
from the right flows

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.470
through the resistor and
makes the voltage be 1.

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.900
So the right answer is 1.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.290
But for the reason that
you might not

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.490
have originally thought.

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.140
But more importantly, I wanted
to use that as a motivation

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.013
for thinking about, how do we
think about bigger circuits?

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.240
So when the simple circuit,
like two parts, it's no

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.260
problem figuring out what the
answer's going to be.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.430
But when the circuit has even
three parts, it may require

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.290
more thinking.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.480
And you may want to have a
more structured way of

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.630
thinking about the solution.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:40.487
Yes?

00:18:40.487 --> 00:18:43.409
AUDIENCE: What would have
occurred if the current

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:45.844
provider on the right
side was 2 Amps?

00:18:45.844 --> 00:18:47.792
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:51.660
Had this been 2 Amps, you can't
violate this voltage.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.570
So that would have
been 1 Volt.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.790
So that would have been 1 Amp
through the resistor.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.560
So then you're left with the
problem with this guy's

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.330
pushing 2 and that guy's
only eating 1.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.660
But the rules for the voltage
source say eat or source

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.140
however much current is
necessary in order to make the

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.900
voltage equal to 1.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.070
So the excess amp goes through
the voltage source.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:20.400
So the voltage source is, in
fact, being supplied power

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.350
rather than supplying
power itself.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:27.400
Had this been 2 Amps, some of
the power from this source

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.060
would have gone into
the resistor.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.730
And some of the power from
this source would have

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.030
actually gone into the
voltage source.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.150
So if the voltage source were,
for example, a model for a

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.250
rechargeable battery,
that rechargeable

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.720
battery would be charging.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.905
Does that make sense?

00:19:44.905 --> 00:19:47.240
So if there had been a mismatch
in the conditions,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.210
you still have to satisfy all
the relationships from all of

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.470
the sources.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.770
AUDIENCE: What if the
voltage was larger?

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:58.609
PROFESSOR: The same thing
would have happened.

00:19:58.609 --> 00:20:01.265
Except now the flowing
current would be in

00:20:01.265 --> 00:20:01.990
the opposite direction.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.620
Let's say that if the voltage
here had been 2 Volts, then

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.530
the voltage would have required
that there is 2 Amps

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.730
flowing here.

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.590
1 Amp would come from here,
but another Amp

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.130
would come from here.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:18.020
This voltage source will supply
whatever current is

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.521
necessary to make its
voltage law real.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:26.495
Ok.

00:20:26.495 --> 00:20:30.570
In fact, what we'll do now is
turn toward a discussion of

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.960
more complicated systems that
will let you go back and in

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.430
retrospect, analyze all those
cases that we just did.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.240
And you'll be able to see
trivially how that has to be

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.460
the right answer.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.460
So what I want to do now is
generate a formal structure

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.960
for how you would
solve circuits.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.352
Yes?

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:53.240
AUDIENCE: So did we know of
anything that could generate a

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.800
current without generating a
voltage, like in real life?

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.310
PROFESSOR: Can anything generate
a current without

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.080
generating a voltage?

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.130
That's a tricky question.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.280
If you think about something as
generating a current, then

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.700
the voltage is not necessarily
determined by that part.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.030
So that's kind of illustrated
here.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:17.000
If this guy is generating a
current, this guy is not

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.755
actually the element that is
controlling its own voltage.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.470
In general, if you want to speak
simultaneously about the

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.000
current and voltage across the
device, you have to know what

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.600
it was connected to.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.020
Each part--

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.790
we'll get to this in a moment
in case some of you are

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.940
worried about launching ahead.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.300
We will cover this.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.300
This is very good motivation for
figuring out what's going

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.690
to happen in the next
three slides.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:54.320
So each part gets to tell you
one relationship between

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.790
voltage and current.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.450
Generally speaking, that's not
enough to solve for voltage

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.030
and current.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.200
Voltage and current is
like two unknowns.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:11.000
Each element relationship
is one equation.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.660
So the current source gets to
say current equals x, current

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.000
equals 1 Amp.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.400
It doesn't get to tell you
what the voltage is.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.850
So being a little more physical
to try to address

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:27.480
your question more physically,
there are processes that can

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.970
be extremely well modeled
as current generators.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.120
In fact, many electronic
semiconductor parts, like

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.890
transistors, work more like
a current source than like

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.790
anything else.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.590
So there are devices that behave
as though they were

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.570
current sources, but they don't
simultaneously get to

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.390
tell you what is their current
and what is their voltage.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.245
They only get to tell you
what is their current.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.630
So let's think about now, if
you had a more complicated

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.930
system, how could you
systematically go about

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.580
finding the solution?

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.430
As was mentioned earlier,
there's something called

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.110
Kirchhoff's law.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.060
And in fact, there's
two of them.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.500
Kirchhoff's voltage law and
Kirchhoff's current law.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:18.280
Kirchhoff's voltage law, in its
most elementary form, says

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.790
that if you trace the path
around any closed path in a

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.450
circuit, regardless of
what the path is--

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.040
every closed path--

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.650
the sum of the voltages going
around that closed path is 0.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.830
So for example in this
circuit, the red path

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.130
illustrates one closed path
through the circuit.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.680
It goes up through the voltage
source, down through this

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.900
resistor, and then down
through that resistor.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.160
Kirchhoff's voltage law says the
sum of the voltages around

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.990
that loop is 0.

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:56.150
That's written mathematically
here, minus v1 for here, plus

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.850
v2 for here, plus v4
for here is 0.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.660
OK, where do the signs
come from?

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.570
The signs came from the
reference directions that we

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.730
assigned arbitrarily
to the elements.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:13.280
Before I ever do a circuits
question, I always assign a

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.520
reference direction.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.125
Every voltage has a
positive terminal

00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:19.120
and a negative terminal.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.210
And I must be consistent in
order to apply these rules.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:27.800
These rules only work if I
declare a reference direction

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.320
and stick with it.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.350
If midway through a problem
I flip it, I'll

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.810
get the wrong answer.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.220
So the minus sign has to do with
the fact that as I trace

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:41.730
this path, I enter the minus
part of this guy, but the plus

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.200
part of that guy and that guy.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.250
So the sign of v1 is negated
relative to the others.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.510
A different way to think about
that is here, we can think

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.330
that v1 is the sum
of v2 and v4.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.700
That's sometimes more intuitive
because if you

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.280
started here, going through
this path you would end up

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.540
with a voltage that is v1 higher
than where you started.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.580
Whereas starting here, you would
end up with a voltage

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.030
here that's v4 higher than
where you started.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.400
And then by the time you got to
here, it would be v2 plus

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.970
v4 higher than where
you started.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.030
You start one place and on one
route, you end up v1 higher.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.030
And in the other route, you
get v4 plus v2 higher.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.120
So it must be the case that v1
is the same as v2 plus v4.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.710
Those are absolutely
equivalent ways of

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:36.990
thinking about it.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:38.650
So those laws are equivalent.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:40.600
If you think about it
a path, you think

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.305
about some of the paths--

00:25:43.305 --> 00:25:43.780
no.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.700
The path coinciding with the
negative direction of some of

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.750
the elements and the positive
direction of others.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:58.720
OK, how many other
paths are there?

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.090
Take 20 seconds, talk
to your neighbor.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.630
Figure out all of the
possible paths for

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.120
which KVL has to apply.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.450
OK, so everybody raise your
hand and show a number of

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:44.130
fingers equal to the number
of KVL equations less two.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.000
Oh, very good.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.170
Virtually 100% correct.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.420
Why do you all say (5)?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760
Which is to say 7.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.010
Why do you all say 7?

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.650
So there's 3 obvious ones.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.660
I was expecting a
couple of 3's.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.230
This was supposed to be--

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.930
OK, yeah, I do plot
against you.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.410
I was expecting some 3's.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.770
So there's 3 obvious paths
that are analogous to the

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:15.620
first one we looked at.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.980
If I call the first path A, then
there's B and C which are

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.030
the excursions around here.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.850
And you can write the equations
just the same.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.030
They each involve
three voltages.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.620
And they each go through, some
starting at the negative side

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:32.720
and some starting at
the positive side.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.230
So those are in some sense,
the obvious ones.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.040
But there are others too.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.370
So one way to think about it,
what I'd like you to do is

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:44.290
enumerate all the paths
through the circuit.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.640
I should have said all the paths
through the circuit that

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:53.300
go through each element
one or fewer times.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.660
I don't want you to go through
the same element twice.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.280
So here's another path that
would go through elements at

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.290
most one time.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.230
So up through here, over through
here, which didn't go

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:08.050
through any elements.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.480
Down through that element,
across that, down through

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.850
here, et cetera.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.090
And you get an equation
for that.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:14.950
Here's another.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.140
Here's another.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.830
Here's another.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:21.220
And if you try to think about a
general rule, a general rule

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.410
is something like, how many of
those panels can you make and

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.790
piece together where the loop
goes through the perimeter?

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.970
You're not allowed to go through
an inner place because

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.430
if you went through an inner
node, you'd have to

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.770
go through it twice.

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.550
If you wanted the path to go
through an inner element,

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:40.340
you'd have to go through
that element twice.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.810
So in fact, the answer is 7.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:49.200
There are 7 different paths
according to Kirchhoff's

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.970
voltage law, all of which the
sum of the voltages around

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.505
those paths has to be 0.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.260
The problem is, of course, that
those equations are not

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.625
all linearly independent.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.280
So if you just had a general
purpose equation solver-- and

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.330
by the way, we'll write
one of those in week

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.970
8 for solving circuits.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.400
If you just passed those 7
equations into a general

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.410
purpose equation solver, it
would tell you there's

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:20.010
something awry with your
equations because they're not

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.800
linearly independent.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.140
So you can, however, think about
linearly independent in

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.050
particularly simple cases.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.140
This network is a particular
kind of network that we call a

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.070
planar network.

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:37.680
A planar network is one that I
can draw on a sheet of paper

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.570
without crossing wires.

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.040
So I can draw this network
without crossing wires.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.410
I'll call it planar.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.080
And it turns out that
Kirchhoff's voltage laws for

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:54.200
the innermost loops are always
independent of each other.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.490
That's kind of obvious because
as you go to a --

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:58.940
so each loop contains at least
one element that some other

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.460
loop didn't have.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.620
So that's kind of the reasoning
for why it works.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.510
So if you think about this
particular loop, which we

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:13.370
included in the 7, you can think
about that as being the

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.020
sum of the loops this way, the
A loop and the B loop.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.360
Because if you write KVL for the
A loop and KVL for the B

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.980
loop and add them, you end up
deriving KVL for the more

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.220
complicated path.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:30.190
And if you think about what's
going on, it's not anything

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.880
terribly magical.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.850
This path is the same as the A
path added to that path, where

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.900
I went through this element down
when I did the A path and

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:45.610
up when I did the B path.

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:48.230
So those parts canceled out.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.420
That was the rule that I was
talking about how I don't

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:54.480
really want to go through the
same element twice when I'm

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.970
applying KVL.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:00.280
So the idea then is that there's
a systematic way, an

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:05.170
easy way to figure out
all the KVL loops.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.765
You just think about
all the possible

00:33:06.765 --> 00:33:08.360
paths through the circuit.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.210
You do have to worry about
linearly independent.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.440
In the case of planar networks,
that's pretty

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.220
straightforward.

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.510
Planar networks, you can always
figure out the linearly

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.770
independent KVL equations by
looking at the smallest

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:24.140
possible loops.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.960
The loops with small area.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.250
OK, so that's half of it.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.960
That's KVL.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.650
The other Kirchhoff's law is
KCL, Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.760
There we are thinking of
the flow of current.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.770
So the flow of current is
analogous to the flow of

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.560
incompressible fluid.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.960
Water, for example.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.310
If you trace the amount of water
that flows through a

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.560
pipe that goes into a Y, then
the sum of the flows out has

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.660
to equal the flow in.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.710
If that weren't true, the water
would be building up.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.860
So we think about pipes as
transporting the flow of water

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.270
without allowing it to
build up anywhere.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.956
That's precisely how we
think about wires

00:34:10.956 --> 00:34:13.650
in electrical circuits.

00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:16.540
The wires allow the transport
of electrons but don't allow

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.770
the buildup of electrons.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.820
OK, do electrons build up?

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.000
Sure.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.219
But in our idealized world, we
say they don't build up in the

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:31.130
wires, they build
up in a part.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.010
And we'll have a special
part that allows the

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.570
electrons to build up.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.749
So we're not excluding the
possibility that they build

00:34:36.749 --> 00:34:41.840
up, we're just saying that in
this formalism, we don't allow

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.540
the electrons to build
up in the wires.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.090
So for the purpose of the wires,
current in is equal to

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:47.630
the current out.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.949
The net current in is 0.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:57.360
So we will think then, about
the circuit having nodes.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.300
The nodes are the places where
more than one element meets,

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.980
two or more elements meet.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.790
And we will apply KCL
at each node.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.650
So for example, in this simple
circuit where I would have

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:18.010
three parts connected in what
we would call parallel, they

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:20.330
share a node at the
top and they share

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.620
a node at the bottom.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.870
So even though it looks like
there's multiple interconnects

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.290
up here, we say that's
one node.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.940
And we would say that the sum of
the currents into the node

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.810
is equal to the sum of
the currents out.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.960
So if I lab all of the possible
currents that come

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.160
out of that node, I would
have i1, i2, i3.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.685
i1 goes through the first
one, the second one

00:35:43.685 --> 00:35:45.100
and the third one.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.300
And so I would conclude from
Kirchhoff's current law that

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.340
the sum of i1, i2,
and i3 is 0.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:51.720
OK.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.670
Easy, right?

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:59.380
As I said, we're going to make
an abstraction where the

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.620
electrons don't build
up in the wires.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.190
They don't even build
up in the parts.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.330
They do get stored
in the parts.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:10.230
That's a little confusing,
we'll come back to that.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.540
If they don't build up in the
parts, then the current that

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.720
goes in this leg has to
come out that leg.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.930
If that's true, then i1 is i4,
i2 is i5, i3 is i6, and we end

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.030
up with another equation down
here, which turns out to be

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.900
precisely the same as
the one at the top.

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.790
Everybody's happy with that?

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.550
So we're thinking about this
just the way we would think

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.650
about water flow.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:42.840
If there's water flow into a
part, it better be coming out.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.750
If there's water flow in a pipe,
the water that goes into

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.830
the pipe better come out
of the pipe someplace.

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.700
So here is an arbitrary network

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.340
made out of four parts.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.070
How many linearly independent
KCL equations are there?

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.740
So how many linearly independent
KCL equations are

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.280
in that network?

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.280
Everyone raise your hand, some
number of KCL equations.

00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:36.250
OK, I'm seeing a
bigger variety.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.170
I see (1)'s, (2)'s, and (3)'s.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.200
I don't see any (4)'s.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.515
That's probably good.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.600
So how do you think about the
number of linearly independent

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.850
KCL equations?

00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:55.860
So the first thing to do
is to label things.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.660
So you have to have reference
directions before you can sort

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.250
of think about things.

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:04.540
So we have four elements.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.900
We would be expecting to see
four element currents.

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.800
The same current that goes
into an element has

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.460
to come out of it.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.080
So there's element current
1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:21.230
There are three nodes,
so we might be

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.680
expecting three KCL equations.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.190
Here's one node from which you
would conclude that the sum of

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:31.520
i1 and i2 better be 0.

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.520
Here's a node from which you
would conclude that the

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:38.890
current in i2 better
be i3 plus i4.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.440
And here is a node from which
you would conclude that i1

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.230
plus i3 plus i4 is 0.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.380
So I can write one KCL equation
for every node,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.840
that's not surprising.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.820
But if you look at those
equations, you'll see that

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.390
they're not linearly
independent.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.710
In fact, if you solve
this one for i2--

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.150
it's already solved for i2.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.910
Stick that answer up here, you
get i3 plus i4 added to i1 is

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.590
0, which is just the same
as that equation.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.540
So of those three equations,
only two of them are linearly

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.090
independent.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.525
The answer to that
problem was (2).

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.920
And there's a pattern.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.690
So think about the pattern in
terms of figuring out the

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.320
number of linearly independent
KCL equations that are in a

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.735
slightly more complicated
network.

00:42:00.512 --> 00:42:05.880
So what's the answer
here, how many KCL

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.270
equations are in this network?

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.290
Wow.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.020
Well, I'm not getting any of the
answers I would have said.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.776
What does that mean?

00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:23.550
Ah, I'm forgetting to add 2.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.270
That's my problem.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.370
OK, now I'm getting some of
the answers that I would

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:27.980
expect to get.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.080
OK, got it.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.730
I confused myself.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.910
OK, the vast majority say (1).

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.640
How do you get that?

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.890
Which is 3.

00:42:42.574 --> 00:42:45.740
So again, you think of how in
this circuit there are four

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:51.880
nodes, A, B, C, D. So we can
think about writing a KCL

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.060
equation for each one.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.450
If we go to A, A has three
currents coming out of it --

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.360
1, 2, 3.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.910
So the sum of those has
to be 0, et cetera.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:05.010
And if you think about those
equations, they're not

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.450
linearly independent either.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:11.250
If you work through the math,
you see that there's exactly

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:15.330
one of those equations that
you can eliminate.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.350
So you're left with
three linearly

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.250
independent KCL equations.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.210
And so there's a pattern
emerging here.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.460
Somebody see the pattern?

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.520
1 minus.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.770
Can somebody prove
the pattern?

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.520
So there's a pattern here.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.810
The pattern is take the number
of nodes and the number of

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.910
independent KCL equations
as one less.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.398
So the challenge is,
can you prove it?

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.640
And by the theory
of lectures--

00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:51.356
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:51.356 --> 00:43:53.350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.510
And by a corollary of the theory
of lectures, the way

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.010
you would prove it is?

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:57.970
AUDIENCE: On the next slide.

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:58.980
PROFESSOR: On the next slide.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.230
Exactly.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.210
So how do I prove it?

00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:08.930
Yeah?

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.395
AUDIENCE: Whenever you take
minus 1, you just add all the

00:44:11.395 --> 00:44:12.650
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] together
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:15.312
So there's something special
about the last one.

00:44:15.312 --> 00:44:17.304
Why should there be something
special about the last one.

00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:19.296
AUDIENCE: Because the
circuit's closed.

00:44:19.296 --> 00:44:22.504
PROFESSOR: Because the
circuit's closed.

00:44:22.504 --> 00:44:23.760
That's right.

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.230
So the idea is to sort
of generalize the way

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.480
we think about KCL.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:30.710
So we start with a circuit.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.840
We think about having
four nodes here.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.270
It's certainly the case that
KCL holds for each node.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:41.376
So here's KCL for that node.

00:44:41.376 --> 00:44:46.830
But now if you think about KCL
for this node, and then add

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:51.180
them, that looks like
a KCL equation.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.200
But it applies to
a super node.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.520
Imagine the node defined by the
black box, and think about

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.293
the net currents into or
out of the black node.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:13.940
This current i2, which leaves
the red node, enters the green

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.890
node, but doesn't go through
the surface of the

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.520
black node at all.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.600
That's exactly the current
that's subtracted out when we

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.986
added the red equation to
the green equation.

00:45:26.986 --> 00:45:28.940
Does that make sense?

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.090
So KCL says, oh, if all the
currents at a node have to sum

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:40.380
to 0, and if elements have the
same current coming out and

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:48.560
going in, then if you draw a
box around an element, what

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.000
goes into the element
is the same as what

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.240
comes out of the element.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:55.340
It doesn't change the net
current through the surface.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.890
So the generalization of the KCL
equation, KCL says the sum

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.450
of the currents into
a node is 0.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:06.690
The generalization says take any
closed path in a circuit,

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:11.630
the sum of the currents going
across that closed path is 0.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:16.600
So if we apply that rule again,
think about node 3.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.470
If we add the result of node 3
to the black node, which was

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:25.170
the sum of 1 and 2, we get
the new green curve.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.340
We get the new green equation.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.720
And what that says is the sum
of the currents going across

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.120
the green super node--

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:36.530
OK, so what's going on? i1 is
coming out of it, i4 is coming

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.330
out of it, i5 is coming
out of it.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.540
So the sum of i1, i4,
and i5 has to be 0.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.030
Well, KCL says the sum of the
currents coming out of a

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.890
node must be 0.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:54.990
The super KCL says the sum of
the currents coming out of any

00:46:54.990 --> 00:47:00.180
closed region is also 0.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.840
But the interesting thing about
this closed region is

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.425
that it encloses all but
one of the nodes.

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.310
That's always true.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.150
Regardless of the system,
regardless of the circuit, you

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:19.090
can always draw a line that will
isolate one node from all

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.030
the others.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.825
So what that proves is that you
can always write KCL for

00:47:25.825 --> 00:47:28.920
this node in terms of
KCL for those nodes.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.965
Ok.

00:47:31.965 --> 00:47:34.770
So there's a generalization then
that says that you can

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:40.120
always write KCL
for every node.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.130
They will always be linearly
dependent.

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.580
So you can always
throw away one.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.690
So in some sense now,
we're done.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:51.840
We've just finished
circuit theory.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.060
We talked about how every
element has to have a law.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.470
A resistor is Ohm's Law.

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.820
A voltage source says that the
voltage across the terminals

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.295
is always a constant.

00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:02.730
A current source says that the
current through the current

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.530
source is always a constant.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.380
So every element tells
you one law.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.760
We know how to think
about KVL.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:18.930
So we know the rule for how the
across variables behave.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.230
What's the aggregate behavior
of all the across variables?

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.140
Well, KVL has to be satisfied
for every possible loop.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.430
The loops don't have
to be independent.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.620
You have to worry about whether
they're independent.

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.020
The only simple rule we came up
with-- we'll come up with

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.415
another one in a moment.

00:48:32.415 --> 00:48:35.340
The only simple rule that we
came up with was for planar

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.410
circuits, where the innermost
loops were linearly

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.720
independent of each other.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.280
And you have to write KCL for
all the nodes, except one.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.530
One of them never matters.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.210
So in some sense, we're done.

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.450
What we would do to
solve the circuit,

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.310
think about every element.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:59.240
For every element assign a
voltage, a reference voltage.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.570
For every element,
assign a current.

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:04.460
Make sure they go in the
right direction.

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.460
We always define currents
to go down

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.070
the potential gradient.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.920
They always go in the directions
through the element

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.840
from the positive
to the negative.

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.610
So for every element, assign
a current and a voltage.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:22.420
We have 6 elements, that's
12 unknowns.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.370
Now we dig and we find
12 equations.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:28.980
In this particular circuit, we
found those 12 equations.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.505
There were three KCL equations,
one for each of the

00:49:31.505 --> 00:49:32.550
inner loops.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.420
There were three KCL equations,
one for each node

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.080
except one.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:41.020
There were 5 Ohm's law
equations, one for each one of

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:41.750
the resistors.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.390
There was one source equation
for the voltage source.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:49.120
12 equations, 12 unknowns,
we're done.

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.900
The only problem is a
lot of equations.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.500
It's not a very complicated
circuit.

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.430
We've only got 6 elements.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.580
I tried to motivate this in
terms of studying networks

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:04.390
that had 10 to the 9 elements.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.750
This technique is not
particularly great

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.920
at 10 to the 9.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.240
It would probably work.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.130
But we would probably
be interested in

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:15.970
finding simpler ways.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.430
So there are simpler ways you
might imagine, and we'll

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:24.680
discuss two of them
just very briefly.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:27.160
The dumb way that I just talked
about is what we call

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.190
primitive variables,
element variables.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:33.600
If you write all the element
variables, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.480
v6, all of the element currents,
i1, i2, i3, i4, i5,

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.630
i6, write all the equations,
you can solve it.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:43.620
However, if you're judicious,
you can figure out a smaller

00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.600
number of unknowns and a
correspondingly smaller number

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.340
of equations.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.640
One method is called
the node method.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.400
When we're thinking about the
individual elements, the thing

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.465
that matters is the voltage
across the element.

00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:02.130
However, that's not
the easy way to

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:06.140
write the circuit equations.

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:10.110
A much easier way is not to tell
me the voltage across an

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:13.360
element, but instead tell me
the voltage associated with

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.610
each of the nodes.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:23.400
If I tell you the voltage
associated with every node,

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.930
the important thing about that
way of defining the variables

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.040
is that you're guaranteed that
from those variables, you can

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:32.360
tell me the voltage
across every part.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.630
So for example, in this circuit,
this voltage source--

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:42.140
so if I call this one ground,
we'll always have a magic node

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.410
called ground.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:47.490
It is not special
in the least.

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:50.780
It's just the reference
voltage.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.610
I'll come back to that.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:54.400
I'll say words in a minute about
what the reference is.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.100
We always get to declare
one node to be ground.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.270
We get one free node.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.830
It's a node whose voltage we
don't care about because it's

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.380
the reference for
all voltages.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.260
It's a node whose current we
don't care about because we

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.370
get to throw away one node when
we do current equations.

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:15.400
So we have one special mode
called ground, about which we

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.660
don't care too much.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.900
Except that it's the most
important node in the circuit.

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.650
Except for that, we don't
care about it.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.430
So this guy's ground.

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:26.080
We think about its
voltage being 0.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:30.360
Then this voltage supply
makes that node be v0.

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.250
I don't know what that is,
so I'll call it e1.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:36.340
And I don't know what that
is, so I'll call it e2.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:39.600
So if I tell you the voltage on
all of those nodes, ground

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.550
voltage is 0, the top voltage is
v0, the left voltage is e1,

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.670
the right voltage is e2.

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:51.700
From those four numbers, 0 and
3 nontrivial numbers, you can

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:54.940
find all of the component
voltages.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.460
So for example, the voltage v6,
the voltage across R6 is

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.710
e2 minus e1.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.740
The voltage v4, the voltage
across the R4

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.470
resistor is e1 minus 0.

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:15.690
So if I tell you all the node
voltages, you can tell me all

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.250
of the element voltages.

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:20.530
And in general, there's fewer
nodes than there are

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:21.560
components.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.820
OK, that's great.

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.990
So instead of naming the volts
across the elements, we'll

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.115
name the voltages at the nodes
because there's fewer of them.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:36.620
Then, all we need to do in the
node method is write the

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:42.780
minimum number of
KCL equations.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:46.060
We know we only have two
unknowns, e1 and e2.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:47.970
And it turns out-- and you
can prove this, but I

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.990
won't prove it today.

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:54.000
It turns out that you need
two KCL equations.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.670
Two unknowns, e1, e2,
two KCL equations.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:01.400
And it turns out those two KCL
equations are exactly the KCL

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.400
equations associated
with the two nodes.

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:10.990
So the current leaving
e1, so KCL at e1 --

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:14.780
well, there's a current
that goes that way.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.080
Well, that's the voltage drop
in going from e1 to v0, e1

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:21.380
minus v0, divided by R2.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.610
That's Ohm's law.

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:28.600
So this term represents the
current going up that leg plus

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.930
the current that goes through
this leg, which is e1

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:33.780
minus e2 over R6.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:36.450
Plus the current going in
that leg, which is e1

00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:39.250
minus 0 over R4.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:40.980
The sum of those three
currents better be 0.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.460
Analogously, the sum of the
currents at this node must be

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:50.070
0, and the equation looks
virtually the same.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:56.230
Because v0 is known, so it
didn't add an unknown.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:00.250
v0 was set by the voltage,
by the voltage source.

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:04.000
So I have two equations,
two unknowns, solved.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:04.630
Done.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.040
So rather than solving 12
equations and 12 unknowns, I

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.300
can do it with two equations
and two unknowns.

00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:11.640
That's called the node method.

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:15.610
One of the most interesting
theories about circuits is

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.110
that every simplification that
you can think about for

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.250
voltage has an analogous
simplification that you can

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:23.050
think about in current.

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:24.030
That's called duality.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.430
We won't do that because it's
kind of complicated.

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:27.790
But it's kind of
a cute result.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.500
If you can think of a
simplification that works in

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.920
voltage, then there is
an analogous one, and

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.200
you can prove it.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.860
In fact, you can formally derive
what it must have been.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:42.970
This is a rule for how you can
simplify things by thinking

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.115
about voltages in aggregate.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.480
Rather than thinking about the
element voltages, think about

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.890
the node voltages.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:56.510
The analogous current law is
rather than thinking about the

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:59.770
currents through the elements,
the element currents, think

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.950
about loop currents.

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.110
OK, that's a little bizarre.

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:07.430
So we name the loop, the current
that flows in this

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:12.590
loop, IA, the current that flows
in this loop, IB, and

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.780
the current hat flows
in this loop, IC.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.280
What on earth is he doing?

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.250
Well, the element voltages are
some linear combination of

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:24.070
those loop currents.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.460
And in fact, the coefficients in
the linear combination are

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.660
one and minus one.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:32.320
So the element current I4, the
current that flows through the

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.780
R4 resistor is the sum of
IA coming down minus IC,

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.670
which is going up.

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:45.500
So there's a way of thinking
about each element current as

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.790
a sum or difference of
the loop currents.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.180
Everybody get that?

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.600
So instead of thinking about
the individual element

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.190
currents, I think about
the loop currents.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:57:00.900
And now, I need to write
three KVL equations.

00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:06.730
So in the node method, I named
the nodes and had to write two

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.480
KCL equations.

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.205
Here, I named the loop currents
and I have to write

00:57:11.205 --> 00:57:15.590
three KVL equations,
one for each loop.

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:16.760
It's completely analogous.

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.420
If you write out a sentence,
what did you do?

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.760
I assigned a voltage to every
node, and I wrote

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:22.910
KCL of all the nodes.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:26.040
Then if you turn the word
"current" into the word

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.540
"voltage," the word "node"
into the word "loop," you

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:33.920
derive this new method.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.340
So this says that if I write KVL
at the A loop, think about

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.580
spinning around this loop, as
I go up through the voltage

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.910
source, so I go in the negative
terminal here.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.090
So that's minus v0.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:48.940
As I go down through this
resistor, I have to use Ohm's

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.770
law, so that's R2 times
the down current.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:57.610
Well, the down current is
IA down minus IB up.

00:57:57.610 --> 00:57:59.380
So I went up through here,
down through here.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:01.160
Now I go down through
this one.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.580
When I go down through that one,
according to Ohm's law,

00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:07.530
that's R4 times the current
through that element.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:13.490
That current-- well, it's
IA down and it's IC up.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:18.650
So this is the KVL equation
for that loop.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:23.030
I write two more of them, and I
end up with three equations

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:25.590
and three unknowns.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:29.410
Both the node method and the
loop method resulted in a lot

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:33.330
fewer equations than
the primitives did.

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:38.400
I had 12 primitive unknowns,
6 voltages and 6 currents.

00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.670
In the node method, I get the
number of independent nodes as

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:44.910
the number of equations and
unknowns, which is less than

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.520
the number of primitive
variables.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.280
In the loop method, I have the
number of independent loops.

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.100
Which is again, smaller.

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.220
So the idea then is that we have
a couple of ways to think

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.360
about solving circuits.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.450
Fundamentally, all we have are
the element relationships and

00:59:04.450 --> 00:59:05.846
the rules for combination.

00:59:05.846 --> 00:59:09.180
Oh, this is starting to sound
like PCAP, primitives and

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.380
combinations.

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:14.860
So the primitives are, how does
the element constrain the

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.260
voltages and currents?

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.470
We know three of those,
Ohm's law, voltage

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:21.480
source, current source.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:24.380
And what are the rules
for combination?

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:27.010
Well, the currents add to the
node, and the voltages add

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:30.070
around loops.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:33.720
OK, just to make sure you've
absorb all that, figure out

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.535
the current I for
this circuit.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.810
OK, what's a good
way to start?

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:38.830
What should I do to start
thinking about calculating I?

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.190
OK, bad way.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.520
Assign voltages and currents
to everything.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.150
4 elements, that's 4 voltages,
4 currents.

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:47.620
That's 8 unknowns.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.990
Find 8 equations, solve.

01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:50.200
That'll work.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:50.980
Bad way.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:52.230
What's a better way?

01:02:56.146 --> 01:02:57.396
OK, [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:01.954
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:03:01.954 --> 01:03:03.890
PROFESSOR: It was on
the previous sheet.

01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:06.820
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.020
AUDIENCE: KVL [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.660
PROFESSOR: KVL for where?

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.616
AUDIENCE: Loops.

01:03:11.616 --> 01:03:12.594
PROFESSOR: Which loop?

01:03:12.594 --> 01:03:13.572
AUDIENCE: Left loop.

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:16.506
PROFESSOR: So do KVL
on the left loop?

01:03:16.506 --> 01:03:17.973
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:03:17.973 --> 01:03:19.440
PROFESSOR: OK, that's good.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.090
But you have to tell me how
to assign variables.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.273
Do you want 8 primitive
variables?

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.920
8 primitive variables are v1,
i1, v2, i2, v3, i3, v4, i4.

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:38.540
So that's what I mean by
primitive variables.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.700
Or element variables is
another word for it.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.555
What's a better way than using
element variables?

01:03:47.552 --> 01:03:48.000
Yeah.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.908
AUDIENCE: Create 2
loop equations.

01:03:49.908 --> 01:03:52.902
PROFESSOR: Create 2 loop
equations, that's fantastic.

01:03:52.902 --> 01:03:54.950
AUDIENCE: I1 for the first loop,
I2 for the second loop.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:58.750
PROFESSOR: So if you do I1 going
around here, then I1 is

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:05.915
actually I. And if you do I2
going around here, what's I2?

01:04:10.673 --> 01:04:11.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:16.490
PROFESSOR: So if I think about
I2 spinning around this loop,

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:20.920
so the sum of I1 and I2
goes through that box.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.200
But the only current that goes
through this box is?

01:04:26.556 --> 01:04:27.806
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:29.993 --> 01:04:31.957
PROFESSOR: So the suggestion
is that I think about--

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:49.790
so if I have I1 here, but I know
that's I. Then I can see

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.310
immediately that since
the only current that

01:04:51.310 --> 01:04:52.380
goes through here--

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.100
so if I have I1 and I2.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.010
That was a very clever idea.

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.090
If you have I1 and I2, the only
current that goes through

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:02.470
here is I. So I1
must've been I.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.640
The only current that
goes over here

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.390
must've been this guy.

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:11.340
So this must be minus 10.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.130
So I could redo that this way.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:19.130
I could say I've got
10 going that way.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.410
That make sense?

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:26.340
So now I only have one unknown
which is I. So that's a very

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.310
clever way of doing it.

01:05:28.310 --> 01:05:31.720
So what I could do
is showed here.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:35.180
I have I going around one
loop and I have 10

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:37.950
going around that loop.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.950
That completely specifies
all the currents.

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:43.080
So now all I need to
do is write KVL for

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.980
these different cases.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:50.810
So if I write KVL for the left
loop, then I get going up

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:55.160
through here, that's minus 15,
and going down through here,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.360
going to the right through
this guy is 3I.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:03.090
Going down through this guy
is 2 times I plus 10.

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:05.450
Both of these are going down,
so you have to add them.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:11.960
So I get one equation
and one unknown.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:15.160
And when I solve it,
I get minus one.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.410
That make sense?

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:19.900
There's an analogous
way you could have

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.150
done it with one node.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.130
You could have said that the
circuit has a single node and

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:31.860
figured out KCL for
that one node.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.170
KCL would be the sum of
the currents here.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.770
There's a current that
goes that way, that

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:36.880
way, and that way.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.240
And again, you end up with
1 equation and 1 unknown.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.069
Yes?

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:41.319
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:06:45.558 --> 01:06:46.808
PROFESSOR: Correct.

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:51.430
If I thought about this current
going this way, it

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.890
would be minus 10.

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:59.050
If I flipped the direction,
then it's plus 10.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.820
So the loop current has the
property that it's the only

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.290
current through this element.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.220
So that has to match.

01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:11.234
It's one of two currents that
go through this element.

01:07:11.234 --> 01:07:13.186
AUDIENCE: You said that
everything that

01:07:13.186 --> 01:07:15.626
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:07:15.626 --> 01:07:17.578
PROFESSOR: This loop is
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:07:17.578 --> 01:07:18.066
Yes.

01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:20.018
AUDIENCE: So why is the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:24.410
PROFESSOR: Correct.

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:26.880
I want to have this
picture now.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.570
So if I'm doing it with loops,
I have two loops.

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.100
The current through this element
is just I. The current

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.720
through this element is just
I. The current through this

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.020
element is just 10.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.040
The current through this
element-- well, the sum of

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.560
these two currents go through
that element.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.512
Does that make sense?

01:07:49.512 --> 01:07:50.762
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:55.428 --> 01:07:57.893
PROFESSOR: This loop current
is just a fraction of the

01:07:57.893 --> 01:08:01.344
current in the whole system.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:05.550
So this loop current goes
through this element and

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:07.150
contributes to this element.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.400
But so does that one.

01:08:12.074 --> 01:08:15.150
OK, if you're still confused,
you should try to get it

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.170
straightened out in one of the
software labs or the hardware

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:18.670
lab, or talk to me
after lecture.

01:08:18.670 --> 01:08:20.760
But the idea is to
decompose in the

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.720
case of the node voltages.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.380
Think about the element
voltages in terms of

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:27.000
differences in the
node voltages.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:32.439
In the case of the loop
currents, think about the

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:36.100
element currents in terms of
a sum of loop currents.

01:08:40.029 --> 01:08:43.600
OK, so the answer is minus 1
regardless of how you do it.

01:08:46.345 --> 01:08:46.472
Ok.

01:08:46.472 --> 01:08:49.439
The remaining thing I want to
do today is think about

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:52.140
abstraction.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:55.180
We've talked about the
primitives, which are things

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:59.750
like resistors, voltage sources,
and current sources.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:03.100
Means of combinations,
that's KVL and KCL.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.090
Now we want to think
about abstraction.

01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:07.700
And the first abstraction that
we'll talk about is, how do

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.510
you think about one element
that represents

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.680
more than one element?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.740
This is the same thing that we
did when we thought about

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.770
linear systems, when we did
signals and systems.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:23.270
We started with R's and K's and
pluses, and we made single

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:29.020
boxes that had lots of R's and
pluses and gains in them.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.590
What was the name of the thing
that was inside the box?

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:36.270
If we combined lots of R's,
gains, and pluses into a

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:39.860
single box, what would we call
the thing that's in the box?

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:41.019
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:41.019 --> 01:09:41.789
PROFESSOR: Shout again.

01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:42.260
AUDIENCE: System function.

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.930
PROFESSOR: System function.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:45.019
Right?

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:47.609
So we started with boxes
that only had

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:49.580
things like R's in them.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.920
But eventually, we got boxes
that looked like much more

01:09:53.920 --> 01:10:00.000
complicated things like that.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.170
We thought about a system
function which was a

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:06.580
generalized box, that could have
lots of R's, or lots of

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.890
gains, or lots of
pluses in it.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:14.810
And that was a way of
abstracting complicated

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.140
systems so they looked
like simple systems.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.900
What we want to do here is the
same thing for circuits.

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.530
We want to have a single
element, a single circuit

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:25.620
element, that represents
many circuit elements.

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:29.240
And the simplest case of that
is for series in parallel

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.050
combinations of resistors.

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.890
It's very simple to think about
how if you had two Ohm's

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:39.220
law devices connected in series,
you could replace

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.490
those two with a single
resistor.

01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:45.520
And the voltage-current
relationships measured at the

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.460
outside of the box would
be the same.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:53.930
That's how we think about an
abstraction in circuits.

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:59.730
When is it that you can draw
a box around a piece of a

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:03.590
circuit and think about
that as one element?

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:06.350
The very simplest cases, the
series combination of two

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:09.940
resistors, same sort of thing
happens for the parallel

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.830
combination.

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:15.870
And that simple abstraction
makes some things very easy.

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.370
What would be the equivalent
resistance for a complicated

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.350
system like that?

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:24.070
Well, that's easy.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:29.440
All you need to do is think
about successively reducing

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.170
the pieces.

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.050
Here I'm thinking about that
having four resistors.

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:39.020
I can just successively apply
series and parallel in order

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.760
to reduce that, make it
less complicated.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.660
So I can think about combining
these two in series to get,

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:50.025
instead of two 1 Ohm resistors,
one 2 Ohm resistor.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:56.640
Then I can think about these
two 2 Ohm resistors being

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.170
equivalently one parallel
1 Ohm resistor.

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.170
And so this whole thing looks
as though it's just 2 Ohms

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:09.560
from the outside world.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.220
That's what we mean
by an abstraction.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:15.430
What we're trying to do and what
we will do over the next

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:18.380
two weeks, is we'll think
about ways of combining

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.630
circuits so that we can reduce
the complexity this way.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.070
Another convenient way of
thinking about reducing the

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:31.120
work that you need to do is to
think about common patterns

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.130
that result.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:37.740
PCAP, Primitives, Combinations,
Abstractions.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.120
So the series of parallel
idea was an abstraction.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.330
A pattern, here's a
common pattern.

01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:48.930
If you've got two resistors in
series, if the same current

01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:52.250
flows through two resistors,
then there's a way of very

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:56.170
simply calculating the voltage
that falls across each.

01:12:56.170 --> 01:13:01.090
So you can think about the sum
resistor, R1 plus R2 since

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:03.290
they're in series.

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.190
So that allows you then
to compute the

01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:08.390
current from the voltage.

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:11.240
Then the voltage that falls
across this guy is by Ohm's

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.000
law, just the current
times its resistor,

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.150
which is like that.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.970
And similarly with this one.

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:24.560
So you can see that some
fraction of this voltage v

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.930
occurs across the v1 terminal.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:30.100
And some different fraction
appears across the v2

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:34.770
terminal, such that the sum of
the fractions is, of course,

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.280
v. That's what has to
happen for the two.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.260
And there's a proportional
drop.

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.350
The bigger R1, the bigger is the
proportion of the voltage

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:45.860
that falls across R1.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.620
So it's a simple way of thinking
about how voltage

01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:51.120
drops across two resistors.

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.610
There's a completely analogous
way of thinking about how

01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:58.690
current splits between
two resistors.

01:13:58.690 --> 01:14:02.440
Here the result looks virtually
the same, except it

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.710
has kind of the unintuitive
property that most of the

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:11.710
current goes through the
resistor that is the smallest.

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:19.910
So you get a bigger current in
i1 in proportion to the R2.

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:23.040
So it works very much like the
voltage case, except that it

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.060
has this inversion in it, that
the current likes to go

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.870
through the smaller resistor.

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.670
OK, so last problem.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:38.880
Using those kinds of ideas,
think about how you could

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.855
compute the voltage v0 and
determine what's the answer.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.910
So what's the easy way to
think about this answer?

01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:35.160
What do I do first?

01:16:38.912 --> 01:16:40.409
AUDIENCE: Superposition.

01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:41.407
PROFESSOR: So superposition?

01:16:41.407 --> 01:16:43.902
That's one thing.

01:16:43.902 --> 01:16:46.397
AUDIENCE: Simplify
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:16:46.397 --> 01:16:47.395
PROFESSOR: Simplify.

01:16:47.395 --> 01:16:51.886
So what's a good
simplification?

01:16:51.886 --> 01:16:52.884
Collapse?

01:16:52.884 --> 01:16:56.127
AUDIENCE: You can put the two
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in series and

01:16:56.127 --> 01:16:57.375
treat them as one.

01:16:57.375 --> 01:17:01.780
PROFESSOR: So you can treat this
as a series combination,

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.025
and you can replace the series
of 1 and 3 with a?

01:17:06.025 --> 01:17:06.995
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:17:06.995 --> 01:17:07.480
AUDIENCE: 4..

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.935
PROFESSOR: 4.

01:17:08.935 --> 01:17:12.330
So this can be replaced by
four [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:12.815
resistor.

01:17:12.815 --> 01:17:13.300
Now what?

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.725
AUDIENCE: You can do the same
on the parallel one.

01:17:15.725 --> 01:17:18.343
PROFESSOR: So you can replace
the parallel of the 6

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:19.506
and a 12 with a?

01:17:19.506 --> 01:17:20.342
AUDIENCE: 4.

01:17:20.342 --> 01:17:22.653
PROFESSOR: Amazing
-- with a 4.

01:17:22.653 --> 01:17:25.599
So there's a 4 there and
there's a 4 there.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:26.090
And the answer is?

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:27.072
AUDIENCE: It's half.

01:17:27.072 --> 01:17:28.545
PROFESSOR: Half of whatever
it was by voltage

01:17:28.545 --> 01:17:30.020
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] relationship.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.760
So you think about this
becoming that.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.120
You think about the parallel
becoming that.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.200
You get a simple divide
by 2 voltage divider.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:46.660
So the answer is 7 and 1/2,
which was the middle answer.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:51.780
And so what we did today was
basically a whirlwind tour of

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:54.790
the theory of circuits.

01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:58.060
And the goal for the rest of the
week is to go to the lab

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.580
and do the same sort of thing
with practical where you build

01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:03.440
a circuit, and try to use some
of these ideas to understand

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.690
what it does.
