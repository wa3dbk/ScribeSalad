00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.980
KENDRA PUGH: Today I'd like
to talk to about poles.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.540
Last time I ended up talking
to you about LTI

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.180
representations and
manipulations.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.570
And, in particular, I want to
emphasize the relationship

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.870
between feedforward and feedback
systems, in order to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.790
segway us into the poles..

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.160
Using what we know about that
relationship, we can find the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.640
base of a geometric sequence.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.240
And that geometric sequence
actually represents the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.220
long-term response of our
system to a unit sample

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.690
response or a delta.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.710
That value is also what
we refer to the poles.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.450
At this point, I'll go over how
to solve for them and very

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.080
basic properties of them.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.440
So that we can use the
information that we have about

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.980
the poles to try to actually
predict the future or look at

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.681
the long-term behavior
of our system.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.200
First a quick review.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.290
Last time we talked about
feedforward systems.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.570
And, in particular, I want to
emphasize the fact that if you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690
have a transient input to your
feedforward system, you're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.680
going to end up with a
transient response.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.550
There's no method by which a
feedforward system can retain

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.440
information over more than the
amount of time steps that you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.170
feed information into it.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
Feedback systems, on the other
hand, represent a persistent

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.940
response to a transient input.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.480
Because you're working with a
feedback system information

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.690
that you put in can be reflected
in more than one

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.540
time step and possibly multiple
time steps, depending

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.410
upon how many delays
you have working in

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.710
your feedback system.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.020
Last time I also drew out
the relationship between

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.370
feedforward and feedback
systems.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.200
You can actually turn a feedback
system or talk about

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.790
a feedback system in terms of
a feedforward system that

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.980
takes infinite samples of the
input and feeds them through a

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.570
summation that takes infinite
delays through your system.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.960
You can represent
that translation

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.660
using a geometric sequence.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.470
The basis of that geometric
sequence is the object that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.630
we're going to use in order
to predict the future.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.320
And that's what we're
talking about when

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.570
we talk about poles.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.550
You can have multiple geometric
sequences involved

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.740
in actually determining
the long-term

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.780
behaviors of your system.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.780
If you only have one, then
things are pretty simple.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.680
You find your system function.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.770
You find the value associated
with p0 in this expression.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.290
It's OK if there's some sort
of scalar on the outside of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.400
this expression.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.525
We're working with linear time
and variance systems, so that

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:51.730
scalar is going to affect
the initial

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.950
response to your system.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.150
But in terms of a long
term behavior, it

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.080
doesn't matter as much.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.750
So don't worry about
it right now.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.450
Relatedly, if you're solving
for these expressions in

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.880
second or higher order systems,
you're going to end

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.450
up having to solve partial
fractions.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.480
You can do this.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.220
And in part, one of the reasons
that you would want to

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.800
do this is so that you can get
out those scalars, if you're

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.960
going to be talking about the
very short-term response to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.780
something, like a
transient input.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.515
We're not going to be
too interested in

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:25.220
those in this course.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.180
We're mostly going
to be talking

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.860
about long-term response.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.450
So we can get around the fact
the we're dealing with a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.390
higher order of systems and not
solving partial fractions

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.960
by substituting in for an
expression called z, which

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.990
actually represents the inverse
power of R and then

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.760
solving for the roots
of that equation.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.600
If you substitute z in for 1
over R in this denominator and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.040
then solve for the root
associated with that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.470
expression, you'll get
the same result.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.290
You'll actually end
up out with p0.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.640
All right.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.530
So now we know how to find the
pole or multiple poles, if

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.660
we're interested in
multiple poles.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.310
What do we do now?

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.529
I still haven't gone over how
to figure out the long-term

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.779
behavior of your system.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.250
The first thing you do is look
at the magnitude of all the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.140
poles that you've solved for and
select the poles with the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.580
largest magnitude.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.000
If there are multiple poles with
the same magnitude, then

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.250
you'll end up looking
at all of them.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.870
If you have different properties
than the ones here,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.400
you can end up with some, you
know, complex behavior.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.960
I would not worry about
that too much.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.960
Or I would ask a professor
or TA when that happens.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.890
But in the general sense, if
your dominant pole has a

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.790
magnitude greater than 1, then
you're going to see long-term

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.130
divergence in your system.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.930
This make sense if you
think about it.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.570
If at every time step your
unit sample response is

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.810
multiplied by a value that is
greater than 1, then it's

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:21.730
going to increase.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.890
And, in fact, the extent to
which the magnitude of your

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.280
dominant pole is greater than
1 is going to determine your

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.150
rate of increase and also
determine how fast your

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.400
envelope explodes.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.380
Similarly, if the magnitude of
your dominant pole is less

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.070
than 1, then in response to a
unit sample input or a delta,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.320
your system's going
to converge.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.470
This also makes sense
intuitively.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.260
If you are progressively
multiplying the values in your

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.670
system by a scalar that is less
than 1, then eventually

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.030
you're going to end up
converging to 0.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.630
To cover the only category we
haven't talked about, if your

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.580
dominant pole is actually equal
in magnitude to 1, then

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.350
you're not going to see
convergence or divergence.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.710
And this is one of the places in
which the magnitude of the

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.640
scalar that you end up
multiplying your system by can

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.990
become relevant.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.170
We're not going to focus on
this situation too much.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.640
But it's good to know what
actually happens when the

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.220
magnitude of your dominant
pole is equal to 1.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.770
The other feature that we're
interested in when we're

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.380
looking at the dominant pole of
a system is if we were to

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.240
represent the dominant pole in
this form, what the angle

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.240
associated with that pole is, if
you were to graph that pole

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.710
on the complex plane using
polar coordinates.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.720
If your pole stays on the real
axis, or if your pole does not

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.180
have a complex component, then
you'll see one of two things.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.490
The first thing that it's
possible for you to see is

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.570
that you'll get absolutely
non-alternating behavior.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.660
Your system response stays on
one side of the x-axis and

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:24.540
either converges, diverges,
or remains constant as a

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.220
consequence of input
of the unit sample.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.855
And you won't see any
sort of alternating

00:07:30.855 --> 00:07:32.950
or oscillating behavior.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.730
This only happens when
your dominant

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.640
pole is real and positive.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.910
If you're dominant pole is real
and negative, this also

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.980
means that it's still on
the real axis, but

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.350
its value is negative.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.600
So if you're looking at polar
coordinates, it's going to

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.800
have an angle pi associated
with it.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.550
This means you get alternating
behavior.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.970
And what I mean when I say
alternating behavior is that

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.770
your unit sample response is
going to jump across the

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.690
x-axis at every time step.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.790
This is also equivalent to
having a period of 2.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.880
The other situation you can run
into is that this angle is

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.530
neither 0 nor pi.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.270
And at that point you're going
to be talking about

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:19.060
oscillatory behavior or a
sinusoidal response that

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.270
retains its edges at the
envelope of your function.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.070
In order to find the period, or
in order to find the amount

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.020
of time it takes for your unit
sample response to complete

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.960
one period, you're going to take
the angle associated with

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.070
your dominant pole and
divide 2pi by it.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.049
This is the general equation
for a period.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:47.880
This covers the basics of what
you want to do once you

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.270
already have your poles.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.430
Next time I'm actually going
to solve a pole problem and

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:55.370
show you what the long-term
response looks like and also

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.100
talk about some things about
poles that I've pretty much

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.300
skimmed over.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.330
And at that point you should be
able to solve and look at

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:04.580
poles for yourself.
