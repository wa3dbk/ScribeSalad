00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.510
PROFESSOR: Today I want to
talk a little bit about

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.890
designing control systems.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.120
This will finish up
our discussions

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.750
on signals and systems.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.480
Let me then just briefly
review where we are.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.790
Hopefully this might help you
also for perspective with

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.320
regard to thinking about
the exam tonight.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.080
We've looked at a bunch
of different kinds of

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.890
representations for discrete
time systems.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.320
The easiest, most concise method
we looked at was the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.700
representation using a
difference equation.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.690
That's mathematically as
concise as you can get.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.500
But it doesn't tell you
important things like who's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.370
the input and who's the output
and what are all the different

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.620
ways that you can get
through the system

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.290
from input to output?

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.670
So for that question block
diagrams are nice.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.680
Block diagrams are graphical.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.500
It makes it very easy to see
when there is, for example, a

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.830
cyclic path through
the network.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.780
But they're graphic.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.100
They're not nearly so concise
as difference equations.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.220
So then we went on
to operators.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.780
Operators are just as concise
as difference equations but

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.400
they contain additional
information because the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.890
operators have an implicit
argument.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.500
So there's an input, which is
the argument to the operator,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.220
and there's an output, which is
the output of the operator.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.210
So you can tell who is the input
and who is the output.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.340
So that's good.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
That sort of combines the
strengths of difference

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.340
equations and block diagrams.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.530
You end up with a concise
representation that has

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.660
complete information about
the signal flow paths.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.700
Furthermore, you can analyze
the operators by using

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.210
polynomial mathematics and that
gives rise to the notion

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.870
of a system functional.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.470
And that's a very nice closure
because that represents an

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.590
abstraction that lets us think
about a whole system as though

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.740
it were just one part, one
thing, one operator.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.390
So we use that structure then,
all of those representations,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.730
to try to learn about
feedback.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.820
And first off, in the block
diagram it's very easy to see

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000
that any time you have feedback
-- feedback so

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.930
enormously powerful that we want
to use it in design --

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.070
but you can see immediately
from the structure of the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.000
block diagram that if you have
feedback then you have cycles.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.880
Why is that interesting?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.060
Well, that's interesting because
if you have cycles

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.560
then even transient inputs can
generate persistent outputs.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.940
So that's a kind of behavior
that we would like to

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.210
understand.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.790
From the nature of feedback
it generates cycles.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.070
From the nature of cycles it
generates persistent responses

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.800
even if there's no input.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.690
And we saw that we could
characterize those by thinking

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.450
about those responses for
one part at a time.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.280
And those parts we thought of as
poles and the responses to

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.840
a single pole we called modes.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.730
So we thought through a way of
decomposing the response of a

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.200
complicated system in terms
of a number of additive

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.900
components that are
based on poles.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.800
Poles are just the base of
a geometric sequence.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.520
So today then what I want to
do is use that framework to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.930
think about design.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.650
How would you optimize the
design of a controller?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.550
Looking back to where we've
been, way back in Lab 4,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.220
ancient history, we looked at
how you could program the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.959
robot to approach a wall.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.330
And we saw that depending on how
you set up that system you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.920
could get very different
performances.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.510
And what we'd like to do is have
a way that we can design

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.580
for performance without
actually building it.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.160
The kind of thing that we built
in the lab, Lab 4, was

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.180
so easy that building it to
determine its behaviors was

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.290
not a bad problem.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.960
But In general if you were
building a 777, there's more

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.800
than one pole.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.280
And you wouldn't necessarily
want to test drive all of the

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.820
bad configurations.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.070
So we'd like to be able to
understand that kind of a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.200
problem analytically.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.170
We'd like to be able
to analyze it.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.790
So using the different
representations you can

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.200
generate a very concise
representation just thinking

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.580
in terms of difference
equations.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.310
You all did this in Lab 4.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.950
And you get a single difference
equation that tells

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.540
you in principle everything
there is that you could know,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.650
but not in a form that's
very easy to analyze.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.400
It's a bit better if you
translate the difference

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.510
equation into a block diagram
because now you can see that

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.220
this system of equations
has in fact two

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.200
feedback loops in it.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
Two cycles.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.570
Two things that might
potentially generate

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.820
persistent responses to
transient signals, which could

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.770
then degrade performance.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.480
If the transient signal lasts
ten years it might be a bad

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.020
controller.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.870
If the 777 hits turbulence
and never stabilizes

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.060
that would be bad.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.950
If small disturbances got bigger
with time that might be

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.770
bad, right?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.740
So we can see that this simple
controller described by these

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.110
difference equations has
the potential to do

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.180
that sort of stuff.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.780
And we'd like to understand,
when does it?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.560
The easiest way to think about
analyzing this is to focus

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.810
first on the inner loop and ask
the question, what's the

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.520
functional representation for
that box which we would call

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.660
an accumulator?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:38.040
This box, this thing,
accumulates at its output, the

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.110
sum of all the things that ever
came in so we call it an

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.160
accumulator.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.420
So what's the functional
representation of an

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.440
accumulator?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.160
Well, we just do polynomial
math.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.120
Easy so we can recognize from
the block diagram that the

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.540
signal Y could be constructed
by applying R to W.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.590
But we can also see in the block
diagram that W is the

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.680
sum of X and Y. And then if we
take the left hand side and

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.010
the right hand side of this
double equation we get

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.100
something that involves just X
and Y, which we can solve for

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.530
the ratio Y over X. Which then
says that the ratio is R over

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.550
(1 minus R).

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.025
That's a functional
representation for the effect

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.910
of the accumulation.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.460
That's also something that comes
up so frequently in the

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.450
design of control systems
that we give it a name.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.550
We call this Black's Equation.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.120
And it's especially useful to
avoid these little trivial

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.930
steps in algebra, to just
jump to the answer.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.630
So let's see that everybody's
following me.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.070
The equation for this box is
the thing that we will call

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.710
Black's Equation.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.980
It's not mysterious.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.270
It's something that you could
derive, so derive it.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.350
Figure out the functional form
for the system that goes from

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:10.330
X to Y and figure out which
of these forms is correct.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.730
(1) through (4), or (5) if none
of the above applies.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.120
So take 30 seconds, figure
out the answer.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.390
I'm going to ask you
to raise your hand.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.640
You're free to talk
to your neighbors.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.060
OK.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.560
So everybody who raised your
hands tell me what the

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.610
right answer is.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.130
OK, wonderful.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:17.360
It's about 95%.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:17.770
No.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.463
It's about 100% correct out of
about 95% participation.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.800
So the answer you can form just
like we did before, no

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.250
particular tricks, using
simple algebra.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.530
Simple algebra you get
F over (1 minus FG).

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.820
The thing I want you to
recognize is kind of a

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.610
graphical way of thinking
about that.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.630
And you can just memorize
F over (1 minus

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.720
FG) and that's fine.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.540
But there's some interesting
things that the designer

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.020
thinks about.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.180
This functional form is F,
that's the forward gain.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.055
That's the gain through the
system starting at the input

00:09:54.055 --> 00:09:57.230
and going directly
to the output.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:04.930
So this form says that the
closed loop gain, the system

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:11.350
function that results when the
loop is closed, is just the

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:15.820
forward gain, F, divided by
(1 minus the loop gain).

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:21.340
The loop gain is the product
around the loop once.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.050
So that's just a convenient
way of thinking about it.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.660
Any time you have a feedback
system of this type you can

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.830
think about the closed loop
response as being the forward

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.660
path F divided by (1 minus
loop gain FG).

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.810
So the answer was 1.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.930
And generally we'll see two
different ways of representing

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.370
the system.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:44.620
Sometimes we'll represent it
with a plus as we did with the

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.120
accumulator.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.960
Many times we'll represent
it with a minus.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.080
That's the way we think about
control problems.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.890
We put in the minus because we'd
like to think about the

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.140
controller as trying to make
something go to 0.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.140
So when you take the difference,
that gives us an

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.730
error signal.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.720
And then we can think about the
controller being the thing

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.120
that drives that error to 0.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.450
But however you think about it,
there's two forms that are

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.980
very closely related.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.420
They really differ by just a
minus sign which you could

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.500
think of as just multiplying
G. So it's sort of like the

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.020
right hand side is just
a minus G plugged into

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.360
the left hand side.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.970
So then the way you use this
idea, you think about the

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.690
block diagram and you say, OK I
can replace this thing with

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.360
an equivalent system
which is R over (1

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.480
minus R) and then repeat.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.500
So the R over (1 minus R) means
that, if you think about

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.890
Black's Equation now for this
loop, you should think about

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:46.840
the forward gain, K minus T, R
over (1 minus R), that's this.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.240
Divided by (1 plus
the loop gain).

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.820
So 1 plus, and the loop gain,
well, the wire down here just

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.480
has a gain of 1.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.625
So the loop gain and
the forward gain

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:58.500
are the same thing.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.170
So you get this kind
of expression which

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.200
simplifies to this.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.890
There's two things I want
you to see about this.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:10.270
First off, I want you to see
that even though the

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.460
simple-minded way of plugging
in said that we should have

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:20.420
got a quotient of quotients N
over D over N over D, it's

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.690
simplified to a single ratio.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.700
If you design a system out of
just adders, gains and delays,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.550
that will always be true.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.740
There's a closure.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.750
It will always be the case
that the functional that

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:40.560
represents a system of that
form will always have the

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.920
property that it's a polynomial
in R divided by

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.820
another polynomial in R,
that's just the way

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.100
polynomials work.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.200
The other thing is that you
can now start to interpret

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.140
what the behavior of this could
represent in a simpler

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.740
form than thinking about this.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.820
So this kind of a representation
that leads to

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.590
intuition about what the
behavior should be is very

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.510
helpful when you're thinking
about design.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.850
And in particular this
particular thing says that if

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.800
we think about a simpler system
that could generate

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:23.690
that same response we can
generate some intuition for

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:27.410
how we would like to set
the parameter k.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.030
So in particular this system
functional which we generated

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:38.060
for this system could equally
apply to that system.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.450
Is that clear?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:50.610
So there's a numerator, which
I've represented here.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.810
There's a numerator, which
has an R in it and has

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.010
a minus kT in it.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.890
I'm going to, for reasons that
you'll see in a minute, I'm

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.360
going to call something P0
because it's the pole.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.620
So the numerator I've
represented here and this

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.160
denominator has this form.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.830
And I wrote it that way because
this is the canonical

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.000
form for the way of thinking
about a pole.

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.120
So what I showed is that even
though this was a more

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.910
complicated system you can think
about it as the cascade

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.395
of a delay, a gain,
and a pole.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.270
The pole can be calculated from
the gain, the pole is the

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:41.890
multiplier for R, so the
pole is (1 plus kT).

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.350
So if I were to choose kT to
be minus 0.2 then the pole

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.460
would be at 0.8.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.170
If the pole is at 0.8 then the
mode, the natural response to

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:59.070
the pole, would have the
form P to the n.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:02.590
They always have the form
geometric P to the n, so it

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:05.490
would look like 0.8 to the n.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:09.030
Because of the pre-multiplier of
1 minus P0 the whole thing

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.460
gets multiplied by 0.2 and
because of the delay the whole

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.240
thing gets shifted
to the right.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.440
The important thing is that by
thinking about manipulating

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.070
this as an operator we can
recognize and simplify the

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.580
form of the behavior.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.650
That gives us an intuitive
grasp over how

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.170
to best choose kT.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.960
It's all clear?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.940
Now, the behaviors that we're
interested in are not always

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.160
unit-sample responses.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.500
We do unit-sample responses
because they're the easiest

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.800
possible thing we could
think of, right?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:51.230
A unit-sample is the simplest
non-zero signal.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.980
A unit-sample is the signal that
is different from 0 in

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.980
exactly one place --

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.950
the easiest possible place, 0.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.600
And it has its easy-as-possible

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.830
non-zero value --

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.060
1.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.590
So we focus on the unit-sample
signal because it's the

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.090
easiest possible signal
we could think about.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.960
But when we're thinking about
behaviors we're often thinking

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.810
about other things.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.900
Often we'll think about
the step response.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.300
Here I have illustrated
the way you would

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.790
measure a step response.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:28.240
A step response is what would
happen if the output were

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:35.080
initially 0, if we were at rest,
and suddenly we turned

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.620
on a signal that was
constant at 1.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.740
That would happen in the robot
case if we started the robot

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.730
close to the wall, at
rest, near 0 --

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:53.220
so that the output signal is
close to 0, but the desired

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.680
input was a meter behind.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.350
Then that would be an input
signal that started at time

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.230
equals 0 equal to 1 and
persisted forever at 1.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.910
And the result then
would be what we

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.230
call the step response.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.490
The step response is typically
easier to measure in the lab

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.910
than is the unit-sample
response.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.880
So we use the unit-sample
response when we're thinking

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.270
analytically, when we're doing
calculations, and we use the

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:19.440
step response when
we're in the lab

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.690
trying to measure something.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.089
And the whole theory wouldn't
be very useful if there

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.780
weren't a close relationship
between those two things.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.780
This diagram illustrates
the relationship.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:38.020
If we think about a system H
for which we would like to

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.930
find the step response, the step
response to that system

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.930
is what would the system
do if you put the

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.080
unit-step into the system.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.290
I've represented the unit-step
here as u[n].

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:57.480
u[n], the signal that is 0 for
n less than 0, and 1 for n

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.220
bigger than or equal to 0 --

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.570
is just the accumulation of
the delta function, the

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.290
unit-sample.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:13.420
So this system, the cascade of
an accumulator with H, would

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.910
measure the step response of H
if it were driven with the

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.160
sample signal.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:26.480
Because of the properties of
polynomials and because block

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.920
diagrams follow the rules for
polynomials, we can flip these

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.750
whenever the systems both start
at rest, and if we flip

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.630
those we get a different
interpretation.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:46.260
What this says is that if you
were to take H and stimulate

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:50.750
it with the unit-sample you
would get h, little h, which

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.000
we would call the unit-sample
response because it's the

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.010
response to the system when the
input is the unit-sample.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.480
So if you measured h with the
unit-sample rather then with

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.520
the unit-step you would get the
unit-sample response from

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.590
which you could generate the
step response by running it

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.840
through an accumulator.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:15.040
So what that says is there's a
close association, there's a

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.430
close relationship, between the
unit-sample response and

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:18.780
the unit-step response.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.060
One is the accumulation
of the other.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.410
The unit-step response is the
accumulated response to the

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.660
unit-sample response.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.140
So that means that in that
previous example where we saw

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:36.280
that setting kT equal to minus
0.2 resulted in this

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.970
unit-sample response, that
would correspond to this

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:41.400
unit-step response.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.630
All you do is for every sample
you calculate, for this

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:52.140
response you calculate the sum
of say, n equals 0, you would

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.360
take the sum of all of the
previous answers in H[n].

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.520
It's the accumulation.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.830
So it starts at 0 since the sum
of all those numbers is 0.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:09.930
Then at time 1 it becomes the
sum from here back so it

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.860
becomes 0.2.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.160
Then here it's the sum
from here back.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.750
And if you add these all up
it becomes a number that

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.860
approaches 1.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.250
Not surprisingly, right?

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.460
If you've got a feedback system
and if you started the

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.710
robot up against the wall and
the desired position was one

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:31.020
meter behind you would
monotonically approach 1, OK?

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.350
And what you can see is that if
you change the value of the

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:40.590
pole, here I've changed the kT
from minus 0.2 which is what

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.360
the previous answer was, to
minus 0.8, I've changed the

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.880
value of the pole,
the unit-sample

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.300
response got faster.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.290
And the unit-step response
also got faster.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.970
The point is there are different
kinds of performance

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.300
metrics that we might want to
use, unit-sample response,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.260
unit-step response, but the
responses of all of them, you

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.580
can tell something about the
response to all of them from

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.350
the response of the unit-sample
signal.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.000
That's why we focus so much
on the unit-sample signal.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.740
It's not because it's the
most popular thing

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.840
to use in the lab.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.830
It's because it's the easiest
thing to calculate with and it

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:25.000
gives us insight into things
that we would like to measure

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.690
in the lab.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:33.360
So for this very simple system
what you can show is that

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.360
there's only a few possible
behaviors, a few

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.160
categories of behaviors.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.370
If you were to choose kT to be
between 0 and 1, then the

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.285
pole, which is (1 plus kT) would
also be between 0 and 1.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:58.840
Since the system has a single
pole you can say a lot about

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.930
the response from the numerical
value of the pole.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.540
If the pole is between 0 and 1
then the response is going to

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.700
be monotonic and converging.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.530
That results because the
unit-sample response was

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:21.650
positive only and decayed
towards 0.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:32.380
Because it's positive only
it means monotonic --

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.080
goes to 0 and makes
it converge.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.550
So you can infer properties
about the unit-step's response

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:42.620
from properties of the pole
just like we could infer

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.720
properties of the unit-sample
response.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.520
If you changed kT to be between
minus 2 and 1 you get

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.010
a P0 that's between
minus 1 and 0.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.260
Again that's just
that equation.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.260
That says that the response
will be alternating.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.160
So the sign of the unit-sample
response goes

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.410
positive then negative.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.650
It still converges in the sense
that the unit sample

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:13.840
response approaches 0.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.200
And what that means for the unit
step-response is that the

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.190
unit-step response will
converge toward 1.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.820
The sign doesn't alternate
around 0, the sign

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.070
alternates around 1.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.370
So again, you can infer the
properties of the unit-step

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.710
response from the properties of
the unit-sample response.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.480
And if you have kT that is less
than minus 2 then you get

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.300
a P0 that's less than
minus 1 and

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.980
that's a divergent response.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.200
So the point is you can infer
properties about the control

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.120
system by thinking about the
poles of the system where here

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.950
I've illustrated it for
a simple system that

00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:59.200
only has one pole.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.720
OK.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.760
I told you a bunch of facts.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.260
Now you figure out something.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:10.340
How would I choose k for this
system to get the quote, "best

00:24:10.340 --> 00:27:00.640
performance?"

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.340
So which value of kT would give
the fastest convergence

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.575
for the unit-sample signal?

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:18.980
OK, participation is down but
the hit rate is still good.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.980
Virtually everybody who
volunteered to answer got the

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.580
right answer.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.055
The most popular
answer was (2).

00:27:25.055 --> 00:27:27.950
Why is the answer (2)?

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.870
What's the range of
possibilities

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.120
that we could get?

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.710
If we choose k, or kT, we
could choose kT to be--

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.190
what's the range of kT
that we could use?

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.260
Minus 2 to 0?

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.060
[INAUDIBLE] we could use kT,
any real number, right?

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.350
We couldn't use imaginary
numbers because that doesn't

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.830
sort of make sense for
a real system.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.330
But we could choose
any real number.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:04.400
The real numbers map, according
to this chart, the

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.710
real numbers map to a different
real number.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.670
If you choose kT you can figure
out where is the pole

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.770
by that mapping.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.735
Where would you put the pole to
get the fastest response?

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:22.230
If you have your choice of
putting the pole anywhere on

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.400
this red line, that red line or
that red line, where would

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.970
you put it and why?

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.140
AUDIENCE: Just inside
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.020
PROFESSOR: Putting it inside the
unit circle would probably

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.862
be a good idea because?

00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:42.130
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:42.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.170
If you didn't put it
inside the unit

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.854
circle it wouldn't converge.

00:28:45.854 --> 00:28:48.060
That's right.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.820
So you like [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
the inside.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.450
Given the choice of anywhere
here and anywhere here which

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.350
would you choose?

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.050
How would you choose it?

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:54.400
Yeah.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.280
AUDIENCE: Derive.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.414
PROFESSOR: Derive.

00:28:57.414 --> 00:28:58.908
And how do you get that?

00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:00.158
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.884
PROFESSOR: What would happen
if it was close to

00:29:04.884 --> 00:29:06.134
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:29:08.106 --> 00:29:10.630
It converges quite
quickly, right?

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.470
Poles always converge
geometrically.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.600
The base of the geometric
is the pole value.

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.150
So you'd like the pole to be
as small as possible to get

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:22.140
the convergence as
fast as possible.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.620
That make sense to everybody?

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.790
So in particular for this
example if you chose kT to be

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:37.010
minus 1 in that limit then this
entire factor goes away.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:42.820
So the entire response
degenerates to R and R is not

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.970
instantaneous but it's
pretty fast.

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.730
What that says is that
you get to the final

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.710
value in one step.

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.860
So if the input consisted of
a unit sample, which has

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.010
non-zero value only at 0, the
output would have non-zero

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:09.150
value only at 1, right?

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.440
Thinking about the way that
works in practice, think about

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.310
the robot and think about
we're trying to

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:17.000
drive toward the wall.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.570
If we made kT be minus one, and
just for the sake of being

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.420
concrete let me say that
T is about 1/10.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.960
That's what the sampling period
is for the robots we

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.880
use in the lab.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:38.720
If T were 1/10 then the best
k would be minus 10.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.550
And what that says is that if
we were 1 meter away from

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:47.350
where we want to be we would set
the velocity to 10 meters

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.620
per second.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:53.400
What that says is that if we
started 1 meter away from

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.880
where we want to be, so this
is intended to represent

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.390
position on the same axis that
this has showed, so if we

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:07.630
started here and we wanted to be
here, time is plotted down.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:11.930
If we use the rule that we just
specified then we would

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.400
set the velocity given this
condition which is 1 meter

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.780
away from where we want to be.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.070
We would set the velocity
to be 10.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:25.380
If we set the velocity to be 10
then after 1 unit of time,

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.820
after 1/10 of a second, we are
1 meter to the right, which

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.130
just happens to be exactly
where we want to be.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.920
Had we chosen k to be bigger
we would have overshot.

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.950
Had we chosen k to be smaller
we would have undershot.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:45.170
k equals 10 gave us precisely
the right answer so that we

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.020
get there in one fell swoop.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.240
Then on the very next step we
would compute a velocity of 0

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:53.670
because we are at where
we want to be so

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.080
we would stay there.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.240
And that condition would
persist forever.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.350
The idea would be this simple
system provides a way that we

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.700
could set the gain so we could
get to where we want

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.580
to be in one step.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:08.830
It's hard to beat that.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.330
The problem that results and the
reason you didn't see that

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.060
good behavior in the lab was
that the sensors in the robot

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.260
don't work instantaneously.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.780
They introduce delay.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.920
And as an idealization of that
delay I want to think through

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.250
the same problem.

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.760
But now let's say that the
sensor delays the input to the

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:36.100
sensor which is the output
of the system.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.980
Let's say that the sensor
introduces a delay of 1, so

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:45.610
now instead of reporting d
sensed, which was d0[n], it

00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:46.860
reports d0[n minus 1].

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.090
So now what would happen?

00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:00.250
Now with the delay, if I started
here and if by some

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:06.750
mysterious process I was here
at time n equals 1, then I

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.080
would calculate my
new velocity.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.130
What would be my new
velocity here?

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.590
I'm right where I want to be.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:17.564
What would be my new velocity
if I assume that the sensor

00:33:17.564 --> 00:33:21.460
has a delay of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.947
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:33:21.947 --> 00:33:23.410
PROFESSOR: 10.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.920
Because of the delay the sensor
is reporting that I'm a

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.850
meter away from where
I want to be.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.870
So the controller calculates,
oh, I need to

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:35.990
go forward a meter.

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:38.710
I'll set the velocity to 10.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:42.320
So having set the velocity to 10
and then one step goes by,

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.330
now we're completely
on the wrong side.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.210
That's what happens when you
put delay into the system.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:52.970
So because we're basing this
decision on where we were last

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.220
time we go to the wrong place.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.880
So now we're here.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.264
What will the controller
say next?

00:34:02.264 --> 00:34:03.150
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:04.480
PROFESSOR: Stay here.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.650
You're in a great place.

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.810
I'm really 1 meter too close.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.429
In fact I banged
into the wall.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.469
But the sensor is telling me I'm
exactly where I want to be

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:16.719
so stay here.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:26.090
Say I didn't kill myself, what
will the velocity next be?

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.199
Minus 10.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.610
So now I tell myself
to go back.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.860
That's probably a good move.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.130
But now I still think I'm too
close to the wall so I tell

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.889
myself to continue to back up.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:44.639
The idea is that I get
poor performance.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.920
The delay had a devastating
effect on the way that the

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.790
controller worked.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:54.190
Even though it's a tiny change
to the way the system works it

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.060
has a devastating effect
on behavior.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.400
We'd like to be able to predict
that without having to

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.240
measure it.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.690
Here's the same equations except
that I put a delay in

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.440
the sensor.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.300
Here is the same block diagram
but I've represented a delay

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.550
in the sensor path.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.060
So now the question is, what's
the new functional

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.910
representation for that
control system?

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.530
So what's the answer?

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.365
Can you rate the functional form
for this system as one of

00:37:59.365 --> 00:38:02.195
(1), (2), (3), or (4), or
is it none of the above?

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.610
About 1/3 participation and
about 100% correct.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:13.860
The answer's four.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.872
You get to use Black's Equation
or however you'd like

00:38:18.872 --> 00:38:20.530
to think about that.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.280
You can think about reducing the
inner loop the same as we

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.930
did before and then think about
this as forward over (1

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.760
plus loop gain) but now the loop
gain has R squared in it

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:35.810
instead of R. We
get this form.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.410
How does this form differ from
when the R wasn't here?

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:42.140
What's the difference between
R not there and R is there?

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:49.275
What's the answer?

00:38:49.275 --> 00:38:50.525
Anyone?

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:55.665
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:59.265 --> 00:39:00.235
PROFESSOR: The squared term.

00:39:00.235 --> 00:39:04.940
So this term in the previous
form was just an R and in this

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.720
form is a square and
so what's that do?

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.330
What's the importance
of the fact that

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.660
there's a square there?

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.790
Two poles, right?

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.850
We now have a polynomial in
the denominator that is

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:21.750
quadratic in R.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.560
And what that's going to do is
it's going to give us two

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.650
poles instead of one.

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.250
The importance of that is that
now we're going to have to

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.140
think through-- we previously
categorized what were all the

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.600
behaviors you could
get from one pole.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.050
The behaviors you can get from
one pole were monotonic

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:45.590
divergence, non-monotonic
alternating divergence,

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:51.840
monotonic convergence,
alternating convergence.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.220
So there were four behaviors
that were

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.590
possible with one pole.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.390
Now we have to think through
what are all the possible

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.780
behaviors that we could
get with two poles.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:00.750
Different problem.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.530
Hopefully they're related.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:08.480
So here, the way we would find
out what the poles are is take

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:15.730
this expression, substitute for
every R, 1 over z, turn

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.410
the ratio of polynomials
in R into a ratio of

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.660
polynomials in z.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.580
To do that in this case I had
to multiply numerator and

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:26.880
denominator by z squared.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.190
Having done that I get a second
order polynomial in z

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.960
in the bottom so there's two
poles which are the roots of

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.960
that polynomial.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.420
And that's just a quadratic
equation.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.050
The interesting thing now is
to map out what are all the

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.410
possible behaviors that that
system can give us.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.470
It's important to realize that's
a simple generalization

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.600
of what we saw before.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.090
It will be the case that any
system that we construct out

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:06.330
of adders, gains and delays will
have the property that we

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.010
can write the system functional
as a ratio of

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:16.930
polynomials in R. By the factor
theorem we will always

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:20.340
be able to factor
the denominator.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.270
And by the notion of partial
fractions we'll always be able

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:26.660
to write some complicated
expression like that in terms

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.960
of a sum of parts.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.700
Each part being first order.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.960
The intuition we get from this
is that what we ought to do is

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:40.630
factor the denominator, find
the poles, and associate a

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.090
behavior with each
of those poles.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:48.080
Here's what the problem looks
like for the two pole problem.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.450
If we have the general form
given here and if we start by

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:59.760
thinking about kT having a small
magnitude, if kT has a

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.300
small magnitude then we have 1/2
plus or minus the square

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.150
root of 1/2 squared.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:06.680
So that's 1/2 plus
or minus 1/2.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.990
That's 0 or 1.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:13.470
So the poles for this system,
if you make k be very small,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:17.040
the poles are at 0,
near 0 and near 1.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.140
Is that a good system response
or a bad system response?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:21.550
Bad.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.800
Why?

00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:27.797
Well, we're trying to think
through the behavior of the

00:42:27.797 --> 00:42:30.520
second order system by thinking
about the separate

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:34.280
behaviors of each
of the poles.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.360
Is this a good pole
or a bad pole?

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.860
Why?

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.760
The response is always pole
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.800
The mode associated with the
response at a pole near one is

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.380
something near one to the end.

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.130
That never converges.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.520
If you start with some error
the error persists forever.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.030
Well, that's not good.

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:06.410
If wind turbulence knocks you
into a decline in your

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:12.230
airplane and it persists
forever, that's not good.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.440
You would like those
things to damp out.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.700
So this pole is bad.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.950
How about that pole?

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.560
That one has a response
that decays quickly.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.870
But the problem is that when
you add the two pieces

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.660
together, that was the reason
I showed you this

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:30.450
decomposition, you can think
about the polynomial being

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:34.280
factored and being broken
into a number of parts.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.180
The part that's associated with
the pole near one has a

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:39.590
response that goes
for a long time.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.390
So that will asymptotically
dominate your response.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:47.950
So we refer to this as
a dominant pole.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:51.070
This pole dominates
the response.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.040
That's a way of inferring the
behavior of two poles from the

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.820
sum of single poles.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.970
In this particular case there's
one pole that matters

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.170
more than the other one.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.280
So we call that pole
the dominant pole.

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:11.990
If you were to make kT more
negative, So here's the

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.720
general form.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.510
If you make kT negative, you can
make the thing under the

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:20.240
radical sign go towards 0.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:24.400
If you made the thing under the
radical sign go to 0 then

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.790
you would get two
poles at 1/2.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:34.370
So here we would see that if kT
were minus 1/4, if kT were

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.550
minus 1/4 we would have 1/2
squared, which is plus 1/4.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.150
Minus 1/4 would give us
0 under the radical.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.470
So we would get two
poles at 1/2.

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.720
Is that good or bad?

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.510
Well, it's better than the
previous example, right?

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.040
Because each of those poles is
associated with the response

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.410
where the error gets half what
it used to be on every step.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.660
So it converges.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.720
If going from 0 to minus 1/4 is
good, then going to minus

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.900
1/2 might be better, right?

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:19.680
If you continue that trend, say
you make kT be minus 1, if

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.660
kT is minus 1 then you get
1/2 squared minus one.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.360
So 1/2 squared is 1/4, minus
1 would be minus 3/4.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.560
That gives us a complex
pole here.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:38.280
So we get two poles that are
right on the unit circle.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.110
What's that mean?

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.900
That means oscillations.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.070
Oscillations is something you
can't get with one pole with a

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:48.240
real system.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.750
Oscillations result from
a poll that has

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.360
an imaginary component.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.160
If the system is real
you could only get

00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:00.330
such poles in pairs.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:02.540
So it's this pair that
makes sense for

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.750
a real valued system.

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.520
And that gives rise to
oscillations and that's

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.140
exactly what we saw here.

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.030
So we can associate the
oscillations that we saw in

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:21.090
the simulated lab experiment
with poles that have imaginary

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:22.340
components.

00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:28.550
So what would be the period of
the oscillation in the system

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:33.620
given by 1/2 plus
j root 3 over 2?

00:46:50.735 --> 00:46:52.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:52.202 --> 00:46:54.464
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:46:54.464 --> 00:46:55.398
Excuse me?

00:46:55.398 --> 00:46:57.740
AUDIENCE: Where did the
root three come from?

00:46:57.740 --> 00:47:01.010
PROFESSOR: The previous page.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.190
If you substitute minus 1.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.625
So what's the period
of the oscillation?

00:47:53.286 --> 00:47:57.171
So the period's represented
by 5 converged into 6.

00:47:57.171 --> 00:48:00.440
So how do you get 6?

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.130
The easiest way to think about
that is to think about the

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:07.020
poles being expressed
in polar notation.

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:09.770
The poles we previously said
were 1/2 plus or minus

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.330
j root 3 over 2.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:15.390
That's the same as e plus
or minus j pi over 3.

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:20.300
It's easier to use that form
because if you take that form,

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:25.020
so if you think about e to the
j, what was it, 2 pi over 3?

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.010
Pi over 3.

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:39.150
So if you think about that form,
that's the pole, we can

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:42.550
write that that way.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.190
Then the inside has
a magnitude of 1.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.360
So we can think about that just
being a magnitude of 1

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.850
and an angle of pi over 3.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:00.010
So when you raise that to the n,
the magnitude to the n, one

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:04.820
to the n is always 1, and the
angle raised to the n, it just

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.010
increases linearly with n.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:12.230
So the angle goes from pi over
3 to 2pi over 3 to pi to 4pi

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:15.030
over 3, et cetera.

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:18.510
So you can think about this
going from pi over 3, 2pi over

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:20.350
3, pi, 4, 5, 6.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:25.990
It takes n equals 6 to get
around to where it started so

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.240
the period is 6.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:36.000
If you were to further change
the game, if you were to make

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.960
it even more negative, the poles
would go outside the

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.560
unit circle.

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.100
And then what would happen?

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.060
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:46.550
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.500
So that's completely
unacceptable.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.470
The point is that by changing
the gain you can get any

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:57.050
behavior on this figure which
is called the root locus.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:50:00.670
So root meaning the root
of a polynomial.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:04.480
Locus meaning the acceptable
values of points.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.280
So the root locus shows you
all the possible behaviors

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.470
they could result from
this system.

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:15.460
So given that root locus, how
would you choose k to make

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.545
your system response as
fast as you could?

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:22.250
So what value of kT
would you want?

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.500
Everyone raise your hands.

00:51:26.122 --> 00:51:27.670
That's very good.

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.780
So the most popular answer
is number (2).

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.350
So why would the answer
be number (2)?

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:35.600
What do you look at?

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:40.496
Yeah?

00:51:40.496 --> 00:51:43.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:43.484 --> 00:51:44.980
PROFESSOR: Remember what
we're trying to do.

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.500
We're trying to infer properties
of the behavior of

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.530
this second order system from
the pole locations.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:57.120
We know that there's an
expansion that lets us expand

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.930
the system in terms of the sum
of two first order responses.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:06.130
The slowest of the first order
responses will dominate

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:07.860
eventually.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:09.720
So what we need to
look at is the

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:13.570
slowest of the two responses.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.940
We would like to know
of the two poles

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:18.400
which one is the slowest?

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:23.220
The slowest is the one that's
closest to the unit circle.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:27.690
So we would get the fastest
response when the slowest one

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.110
is as fast as possible.

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:39.480
As the poles initially go toward
each other from 0 to 1

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:42.470
this one is getting faster, this
one is getting slower.

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:45.460
So the slowest one
is this one.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.590
So the slowest one is fastest
when they meet.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.320
And then when they diverge
does the slowest one get

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.636
faster or slower?

00:52:54.636 --> 00:52:56.500
It's already slower
because it gets

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.980
closer to the unit circle.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.610
So you get the fastest response
whenever you get the

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:08.050
two poles both colliding at 1/2
and that was the case that

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:13.610
happened when kT was minus 1/4
from two or three slides ago.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:18.910
So the idea then is to try to
infer what would be the

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:22.430
behavior of this higher order
system by thinking about the

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:27.190
behaviors of the individual
components, here the poles.

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:29.960
And what we saw was something
that's in fact a very

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.500
important general trend.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.600
What we saw was that we first
analyzed the wall finder

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.110
system assuming there was
no delay in the sensor.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:42.130
And we found that that system
was characterized by a single

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:45.870
pole and we had the design
freedom of putting that pole

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:49.650
anywhere we wanted to
on the real axis.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:54.390
And that allowed us to choose
the pole to be at 0 which gave

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.200
terrific performance.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.580
The interesting thing that
happened when you add just one

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.910
more pole by putting a delay
in the sensor, you make the

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:05.560
system more complicated and
now you can't possibly get

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.030
nearly so good behavior.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.460
The behavior is a lot worse
than it was before.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.390
And in fact, if you were to do
the same kind of analysis by

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:22.550
putting yet another delay in the
sensor you would find even

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:24.550
worse behavior.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:27.810
The idea then, the
generalization of the way the

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.070
behaviors is working, generally
speaking adding

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:35.650
delays inside a feedback loop
is a destabilizing thing.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:40.440
Generally as the number of
delays increases you end up

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.730
having to back off on the
maximum gain that you can use

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:49.020
because the system becomes
less stable.

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:54.440
So the overall moral is that
delays are bad generally.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:56.560
I mean, you could concoct some
kind of a weird scheme where

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:57.460
that wouldn't be true.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.820
But it's actually hard to
concoct such a weird scheme.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:02.270
In general, and in virtually
every physical system that

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.090
you'll run into, adding
delays makes the

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.030
system harder to stabilize.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.010
And that's the big message.

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:13.390
And the system that we looked at
in the lab, the wall finder

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:17.190
was actually quite hard
because the number

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:18.820
of delays was large.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:21.810
If you try to track where delays
can enter the robot

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.460
system they get in at very
many different places.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.270
In the physical sensor, in the
microprocessor, in the

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.230
conversion from analog to
digital, there's a number of

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.850
delays in that system.

00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:36.200
And that's why it becomes
hard to stabilize.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:36.780
OK.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.450
So that's the main content
for today.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.150
What I want to do is give you
one more practice question.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.710
The big problem that I want you
to think about from today

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:51.870
is how do you characterize
performance?

00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.940
When we had a single pole
performance was easy to talk

00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:02.170
about because performance was
diverging monotonically,

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:07.730
diverging alternating,
converging monotonically,

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:09.220
converging alternating.

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:10.970
There were four kinds
of behaviors.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:13.750
When we went to second order
we saw some new behaviors.

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.230
It could become oscillatory.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.040
What I'd like you to do now is
think not just about those

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.600
properties but many
other properties.

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.190
So here's some questions.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.150
Think about the system on the
top and I'd like you to infer

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.950
properties about that system.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:34.350
In particular, does this system
have three poles?

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:37.360
Is the unit sample response, is
there a way to write that

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:41.630
as the sum of three geometric
sequences?

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:44.430
What's the unit sample
response?

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.220
And is one of the poles
that z equals 1?

00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:50.080
So think about the system,
think about five ways of

00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.890
characterizing it and tell
me how many of those five

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.230
characterizations is correct.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:00.045
So how many of the properties
are true?

01:01:03.733 --> 01:01:04.983
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.480
Probably 2/3 correct?

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.730
PROFESSOR: How many poles?

01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:23.355
How do you get three?

01:01:23.355 --> 01:01:24.834
Where are the poles?

01:01:24.834 --> 01:01:27.792
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:01:27.792 --> 01:01:28.285
PROFESSOR: How do
I find poles?

01:01:28.285 --> 01:01:30.257
What do I do?

01:01:30.257 --> 01:01:31.736
Yes?

01:01:31.736 --> 01:01:35.187
AUDIENCE: You use Black's
Equation [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:01:35.187 --> 01:01:38.110
the top you can express
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:41.540
so use Black's Equation to
express the system function as

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.480
R cubed over (1 minus
R-cubed) then--

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.920
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.680
AUDIENCE: --the denominator
as an order of 3 and

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.080
you combine the 3s.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.060
PROFESSOR: So a little more
formally, we would take this

01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:01.160
thing and we would rewrite that
with R goes to 1 over z.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:09.070
So we get 1 over z cubed, 1
minus (1 over z cubed), which

01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:12.810
is then, clearing the z cubes
we would get 1 over

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.820
(z cubed minus 1).

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.290
How many poles?

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:19.890
Three.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:22.774
What are the poles of
z cubed minus 1?

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.230
Three poles in what?

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.718
AUDIENCE: 0 [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.686
PROFESSOR: And so let's vote.

01:02:33.686 --> 01:02:35.174
Let's take a vote.

01:02:35.174 --> 01:02:39.142
There's two poles
at z equals 1.

01:02:39.142 --> 01:02:41.622
Yes?

01:02:41.622 --> 01:02:42.614
No?

01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:43.606
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:02:43.606 --> 01:02:45.094
PROFESSOR: Why not?

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:46.344
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.050
PROFESSOR: So there's
two poles.

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:53.550
I made a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
plane.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:54.800
Where's the poles?

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.140
Well, you could factor
it, right?

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.690
If you factored it you'd
find that there is

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:06.680
a pole at 1, right?

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.170
But then there's two more
poles like that.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:20.290
So the poles are the three
roots of 1, which can be

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:30.210
written like 1 e to the j, 2pi
over 3, and e to the j minus

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.460
2pi over 3.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.070
Which pole was the
dominant pole?

01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:38.320
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:03:43.022 --> 01:03:46.130
PROFESSOR: OK, bad question.

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.016
What's a better question?

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:50.350
AUDIENCE: How many dominant
poles are there?

01:03:50.350 --> 01:03:51.970
PROFESSOR: How many dominant
poles are there?

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:53.100
That's a much better
question, yes.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.130
There's sort of three
poles that are

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.630
equally dominant, right?

01:03:56.630 --> 01:04:00.420
They all have the
same magnitude.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.000
Why do we talk about
dominant poles?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.250
What are dominant
poles good for?

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:12.510
If I told you that I had a pole
at 3 and a pole at minus

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:14.110
1, which one's the
dominant pole?

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:14.590
AUDIENCE: 3.

01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:16.510
PROFESSOR: Why?

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:17.000
AUDIENCE: Greater magnitude.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.620
PROFESSOR: Greater magnitude.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:21.440
Why do we care?

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.300
We don't care, right?

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:25.930
What's good about the
dominant pole?

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:35.320
Well, we can write this response
as something that

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:39.400
looks like three to the n
plus minus 1 to the n.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.260
If you let n get big enough
the only one that

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.240
matters is 3 to the n.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.210
So if all you care about is
exactly how the plane was

01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:53.710
flying the instant before it hit
the ground then you would

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:55.990
only need to worry
about long time.

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:58.150
And if you only worry about
long time you only need to

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:02.030
worry about the pole that's
worst behaved.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:03.770
That's where the concept
comes from.

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:06.740
So none of these poles are
particularly worse behaved

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.810
than the others.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.510
What's the unit-sample response

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.760
associated with that pole?

01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:20.998
We have a name for that
[INAUDIBLE] right?

01:05:20.998 --> 01:05:21.992
AUDIENCE: It's huge.

01:05:21.992 --> 01:05:25.040
PROFESSOR: It's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:26.520
What's the unit-sample response

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.780
associated with this pole?

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.466
Well, it's got a complex
value right?

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:40.870
So the unit-sample response
associated with that pole is e

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:47.050
to the j 2 pi over 3 n.

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:49.430
That's a complex number.

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:56.040
That's 1 at time 0 and e to the
j 2 pi over 3n at time 1

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.420
and e to the j 4 pi over
3 at time two.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.950
So it goes from here at 0 to
here at 1 to here at 2,3, 4,

01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:06.200
5, 6, 7, 8.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:15.100
What's the period
of this pole?

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.230
What's the period of the
unit-sample responses

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:20.550
associated with that pole?

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:21.440
3.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.580
Because it takes 3
to get around to

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.650
where you started again.

01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:28.392
What's the period
of this pole?

01:06:28.392 --> 01:06:28.853
3.

01:06:28.853 --> 01:06:30.697
You just spin around backward.

01:06:30.697 --> 01:06:31.485
What's the period
of the response

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:34.746
associated with that pole?

01:06:34.746 --> 01:06:36.162
Bad question.

01:06:36.162 --> 01:06:38.530
All right, what's a
better question?

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.254
Is there a period associated
with it?

01:06:40.254 --> 01:06:42.614
You could say that period
1 [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:06:42.614 --> 01:06:43.864
definition of period.

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:48.350
What's the period
of this pole?

01:06:51.822 --> 01:06:55.130
Dumb question, right?

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.150
Period implies repeat.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.840
If the response repeats itself
after some time then we would

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.090
say the response is periodic.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:09.270
Neither of those poles,
well, the minus 1 is.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.020
Is the minus 1 pole periodic?

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.285
Yes.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:18.907
What's the difference between
periodic and alternation?

01:07:18.907 --> 01:07:21.160
Does a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.090
alternate?

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:23.070
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:24.215
PROFESSOR: Does it oscillate?

01:07:24.215 --> 01:07:26.019
AUDIENCE: No.

01:07:26.019 --> 01:07:28.420
PROFESSOR: Bad question.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:33.410
Alternate is a word that we
invented for one pole.

01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:35.730
Because the response
alternated in sine.

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:39.350
The unit-sample response in one
pole, where the pole is a

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:41.670
negative number, alternated
in sine.

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:44.790
So we gave that a name.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:47.310
Alternation is not necessarily
something that we would like

01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:50.210
to associate with a higher
order system.

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:53.220
Periodic is perfectly reasonable
to talk about for a

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.580
higher order system.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.920
Periodic merely means that if y
of n were a periodic signal

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:04.360
that I could express y of
n plus n as y of n.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.610
That would be periodic.

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:10.320
If the thing repeats itself we
would say it's periodic.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.650
So the point of going over this
stuff is just to give you

01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:15.670
some exercise in thinking
about how to think about

01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:18.109
properties of systems.

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:19.830
We develop properties initially

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:23.290
thinking about one pole.

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:26.010
Those properties were easy.

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:30.910
Converging, diverging,
monotonic, alternating.

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:34.729
When we try to think about
corresponding properties of

01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:38.040
higher order systems we can't
simply map the simple

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:40.090
properties of first order
systems into the other.

01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:42.189
We have to think about more
complicated things.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.520
Then we think about things
like dominant.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.760
If one of the poles has a bigger
magnitude than the

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.870
other then for large times we
can ignore the smaller one.

01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.795
What happens for short time?

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:03.850
Does this response monotonically
increase with

01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:05.210
time for all time?

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:13.250
No.

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:16.892
Since the response associated
with minus 1 alternates in

01:09:16.892 --> 01:09:23.399
sine, for short times, for times
with n close to 0, that

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:26.750
can be just as important
as this one.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:32.439
So the dominant pole idea tells
you how things work when

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.590
you have large times.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.819
It doesn't necessarily tell you
how things work when you

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.020
have small times.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.060
How about, the unit sample
response is the sum of three

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:42.790
geometrics.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.040
Yes or no?

01:09:46.865 --> 01:09:48.320
What are the three geometrics?

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:54.625
And the answer to that's yes.

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.110
That's very important.

01:09:55.110 --> 01:10:01.720
The three geometrics over here
are this pole to the n plus

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:08.830
this pole to the n plus
something that goes with this

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:12.770
other pole to the n.

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:14.840
Now it's a weighted sum but
the weights are not

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.090
necessarily 0.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.440
The slide that I showed you
for the partial fraction

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.540
decomposition, you can always
write a higher order system as

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.460
a sum of first order factors.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.940
That's the partial fraction
expansion.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:34.070
That doesn't mean the weights
are all unity.

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:39.720
Number (2), can you write the
unit-sample response as the

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.470
sum of three geometric
signals?

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.860
Yes.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:44.290
There it is.

01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:46.390
And if you're really good at
complex math you could find

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.530
out a, b and c.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.960
And that would tell you the
unit-sample response and that

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.570
would tell you the answer
to (3) and (4).

01:10:52.570 --> 01:10:54.407
Is the unit-sample response 0,
0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

01:10:54.407 --> 01:10:56.738
1, 0, 0, 0, 1?

01:10:56.738 --> 01:10:59.410
Or 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 --

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:01.110
whatever.

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:05.140
Is it one of those two or
something different?

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:09.076
And how do you figure it out?

01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:10.060
How do you figure
out the unit?

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.310
Is the unit-sample response--

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.524
Is number (2) correct?

01:11:14.524 --> 01:11:17.174
Is the unit-sample response
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,

01:11:17.174 --> 01:11:18.424
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1--

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.390
Yes?

01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:26.100
How do you know that?

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.841
You could solve that equation.

01:11:32.611 --> 01:11:34.719
Is there an easier way?

01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:36.156
Yeah?

01:11:36.156 --> 01:11:38.551
AUDIENCE: I wrote it as
a difference equation.

01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:39.988
PROFESSOR: Just write the
difference equation.

01:11:39.988 --> 01:11:40.946
Exactly.

01:11:40.946 --> 01:11:43.820
So even though I bad-mouth
difference equations a lot,

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.900
here it's easy.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:49.480
In fact, you can see
it in the network.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.500
Thinking about the difference
equation would be easy.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
Thinking about the network
would be easy.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.270
If we think about the
unit-sample response of this

01:11:55.270 --> 01:12:00.330
thing started at rest, rest
means this is 0, this is 0,

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:03.270
and this is 0 initially.

01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:08.060
Unit-sample response means
this becomes 1 at time 0.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:13.000
At time 0 this is 1, this is
0, this is 0, this is 0.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:27.070
So if I think about what's the
time response look like and I

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:31.820
did plus, this is
0, 1, 0, 0, 0.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.610
The first answer is 0.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:34.170
Clock ticks.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.420
What happens?

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:40.394
This is 1.

01:12:40.394 --> 01:12:43.630
This becomes 1.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:44.570
This doesn't change.

01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:45.510
That doesn't change.

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.620
This goes to 0.

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.640
0 comes around here.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.270
That goes to 0.

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.640
So that's the answer
at time 1.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:55.542
What happens at time 2?

01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:57.070
Just keep working it.

01:12:57.070 --> 01:13:01.850
The clock ticks, this goes to 1,
this goes to 0, these stay

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:05.330
0, this stays 0.

01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:07.870
That's the answer at
time equals 2.

01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:09.790
Now the clock ticks.

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:13.480
Now this comes over to here,
that means it comes back here.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.450
This is still 0.

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:17.750
That comes to 1.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:19.520
That's the answer for time 3.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.940
Now the clock ticks.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.010
And you can see the whole
thing would just

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:24.000
repeat itself now.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.170
Is the response periodic?

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:28.070
Yes.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.200
The response is periodic.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.118
What's the period?

01:13:31.118 --> 01:13:32.086
3.

01:13:32.086 --> 01:13:34.506
And I can see [INAUDIBLE] if
the [INAUDIBLE] there it's

01:13:34.506 --> 01:13:37.530
going to have be related to
the period over here.

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.290
These periods are not same.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:42.300
This period is 3, this period is
3, this period is 1, if you

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.720
want to call that a period.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.390
But they are related.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.780
OK.

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:52.900
The point of this exercise is
to illustrate two things.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:57.680
We inferred properties of first
order systems by looking

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.700
at a single pole which for a
real system could only behave

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:04.570
in one of four different ways.

01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:06.810
Second order system introduced
new behaviors.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.885
Now we can oscillate, which
we couldn't do before.

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:14.170
Having got to oscillation,
oscillation came about because

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:16.060
of complex numbers.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.130
If you go to higher order
systems nothing

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.380
new happens in algebra.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.490
There's no such thing as
meta-complex numbers, right?

01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:28.200
Complex is as bad as it gets.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.720
So you can have complex
numbers.

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.870
The higher order behaviors can
still have complex numbers but

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.360
you have to think when we ask
you, what's the property of a

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.700
higher order system.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.620
You can think about it in terms
of the individual parts

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.320
but it requires some thinking.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:45.740
OK.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.710
Good luck tonight.

01:14:46.710 --> 01:14:47.960
See you then.
