00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.320
PROFESSOR: Today I'd like to
talk to you about some

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.890
techniques that you can add to
basic search to enable your

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.510
systems to make more intelligent
decisions and save

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.380
computation time.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.710
Last time, we introduced basic
search and the basic idea of

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.150
how to encode search so that our
system can use search when

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.730
encountering an unknown
territory or state space.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.000
And today, we're going to review
some things you can do

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.110
in terms of using the
information that you know and

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.980
also using estimations of the
information that you would

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.510
like to know to improve your
chances of discovering the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.040
path that you're interested
in the fastest.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.490
The first thing that we can do
in order to improve our search

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.540
is use dynamic programming.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.510
Dynamic programming refers to
the idea is that once you've

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.080
done a computation for a
particular kind of problem,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.640
you can save that computation
and use it later, as opposed

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.180
to having to engage in that
computation a second time.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.020
The way this manifests in
search is that once you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.970
visited a particular state, you
don't have to visit that

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.830
state again.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.610
Because the way your agenda's
set up, you found the fastest

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.420
way to that particular state,
as far as you're concerned.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.930
So the general idea is that once
you visit a particular

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.920
state, you don't have
to visit it again.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
If you're building a normal
search tree, it can be

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.740
difficult to keep track of where
you've been, especially

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.060
if you're doing something like
that depth-first search.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.990
To get around this and to enable
dynamic programming,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.020
the easiest thing to do is just
keep a list of the states

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.150
that you visited as a
consequence of this particular

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.210
run of search.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.190
I'm going to demonstrate dynamic
programming by running

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.440
depth-first search on
our state transition

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.580
diagram from last time.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.450
The first two steps are the
same, except for the fact that

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.640
we're going to keep track of the
fact that we visited both

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.400
A, B, and C as a consequence
of the first two

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.650
iterations of search.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.720
If I'm running depth-first
search, my agenda acts as a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.010
stack, which means I'm going to
take the partial path that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.010
I added most recently to the
agenda, pop it off, and expand

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.270
the last node in the
partial path.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:40.710
When I expand C, I'm going to
visit B and D. However, B is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.390
already in my list of states
that I visited, because it's

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.700
already in one of the partial
paths in my agenda.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.260
So I'm not going to
visit B again.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.670
Instead, I'm only going to add
one new partial path to my

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.410
agenda, ACD.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.060
I'm also going to add D to my
list of visited states.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.870
If I run another iteration
of depth-first

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.740
search, I find my goal.

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:29.040
For completeness, E is added
to list of visited states.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.980
This took even fewer iterations
that the original

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.450
depth-first search.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.480
We didn't waste time expanding
different nodes.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.240
We also used less space.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.240
In the general sense, the
concept of dynamic programming

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.730
is great to use whatever
you can.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.730
And in search, it can save you
a lot of time and energy.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.580
Another way we can intelligently
improve our

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.040
search technique is by making
considerations for costs that

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.100
we know that are associated with
particular transitions.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.990
In this state transition
diagram, I've indicated some

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.100
costs associated with
the transitions

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.710
between particular states.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.400
If we know the costs associated
with transitions,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.339
then we can use a cumulation
of the weights accumulated

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.120
through traversing a particular
partial path to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.500
prioritize which paths we're
going to explore first in an

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.890
effort to reduce the amount
of cost associated

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.120
with our final actions.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.580
In order to do that, we can
keep track of the value

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.320
associated with that cumulation,
and sort the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.960
agenda at every iteration
based on that cost.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.580
If we're using dynamic
programming, while making

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.310
considerations for both cost and
heuristics, and also when

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.950
we're running the goal test when
making considerations for

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.050
cost and heuristics, we're
actually going to make our

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.470
considerations when we expand
the node as opposed to when we

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.930
visit the node.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.010
This difference is very
important because it provides

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.110
us with the most optimal
solution.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.650
If it's possible for us to visit
the goal node, but it's

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.860
100 cost units away, It may be
worth our while to search for

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.130
alternatives that provide
a much shorter

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.340
path to the goal node.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.970
That's why we switch from
considering when we visit to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.300
considering when we expand.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.400
Let's look at uniform cost
search run with dynamic

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.724
programming.

00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:39.540
In my first step, I expand
A and add two

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.080
partial paths to my queue.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.760
I'm also going to keep track
of the cumulative cost

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.410
associated with that
partial path.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.310
When I expand A, I add
A to the agenda.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.640
Note that I haven't talked
about stacks or queues or

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.070
depth first or bread
first or anything.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.850
We're working with
a priority queue.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.580
And what that means is that
things with a higher priority

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.240
float to the top.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.970
Or things with the lowest cost
associated with them we're

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.720
going to consider first.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.210
This means that I'm going
to expand B in the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.090
partial path AB first.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.740
I'll add it to my list.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:33.650
When I expand B, B has two child
nodes, D and C. ABC has

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.050
partial path cost 3 associated
with it.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.440
And ABD has partial path cost
11 associated with it.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.300
That means when I reprioritize
my queue, I'm going to end up

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:55.030
sorting everything such that
AC comes first, ABC come

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:03.340
second, And ABD comes third.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.110
Previously, with our strategy
for dynamic programming, C

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.200
would not have been added to
this partial path, because

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.210
we've already visited
it with path AC.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:26.290
At this step, we're going to
expand the path AC, add C to

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.410
the list, and any other time
that we end up visiting C, we

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.880
will not add it to our paths.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:42.470
If I expand C, I have a
transition to B, which is

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.360
already in my list, and
a transition to D

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.610
that has cost 7.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.370
ABC is going to float to the
top of my priority queue.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.230
ACB is not going to be
considered, because B is

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.480
already part of my list.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.300
And ABD is going to remain
with cost 11.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.059
At this point, you might say,
but Kendra, why am I

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.350
considering partial path ABC
when C is in my list--

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.620
or C should be in my
list, excuse me--

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.650
as a consequence of expanding
the partial path AC?

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.510
Even though we've expanded the
partial path AC, if we have

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.410
not made any considerations to
weed out our list at every

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.320
iteration, this is still going
to float to the top.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.060
And we're still going to have
to deal with it, even though

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.110
we've already expanded C. Since
we've already expanded

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:07.340
C, we're going to ignore this
partial path and just move ACD

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.730
7 and ABD 11 up to the front.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.870
D is not in our expanded list.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:41.630
When we expand D, we have one
child node E. Because we're

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.280
working with cost and
heuristics, we do not actually

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.340
evaluate the goal test
when we visit a node.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.870
We evaluate it when
we expand a node.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:55.260
So I am going to add
ACDE to my agenda.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.520
It's going to have cost 8.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.160
And ABD11 is still going to hang
out here at the back of

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.410
the priority queue.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:26.260
At this point, I get to expand
E. I skipped adding D to the

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:36.230
expanded list when I expanded
it from ACD to ACDE.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.540
At this point, I'm going to
expand E. And the first thing

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:43.550
I'm going to do is test and see
whether or not it passes

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.060
the goal test.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:50.430
At that point, I stop search,
return that I successfully

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.940
completed the search, and
that my partial path

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.190
is going to be ACDE.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.420
That covers uniform
cost search.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.390
At this point, you might say,
Kendra, this is bearing a lot

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.180
of similarity to things
like maps.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.010
And I would really like to be
able to use my knowledge of

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.990
things like the Euclidean
in order to make more

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.910
intelligent, even more
intelligent decisions about

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.230
where it is that I
go with myself.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.300
And I would say yes, you
should be able to.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.130
In fact, people do.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.640
In fact, people do
all the time.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.610
They say well, some
thing's this far

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.700
away as the crow flies.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.900
So I know that if I've gone
further than that at any

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.390
point, then I've wasted
some amount of time.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.920
But it represents a good
underestimate of the distance

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.020
that I'm going to cover.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.615
This is the basic concept
of heuristics.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.600
If you're attempting to find a
goal, and you have an estimate

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.220
for the remaining cost, but
you know it's not exactly

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.910
right, you can still use that
information to attempt to save

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.110
you an amount of computation
or amount of search.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.570
In particular, you probably
shouldn't be using a

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.240
heuristic, if you know
it's perfect.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.590
Because if you know the
heuristic is perfect, then you

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.550
should be using the heuristic
to solve your problems,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.410
instead of doing search
in the first place.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.820
Or if the heuristic already
tells you how long it's going

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.680
to take to find something, then
it probably also has the

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.210
path that represents how
long or that represents

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.560
that amount of cost.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.940
If you want to use a heuristic
effectively, you have to make

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.130
sure that your heuristic
represents a non-strict

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:48.040
underestimate of the amount
of cost that is left over.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.160
And what do I mean by that?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.470
I mean that if you have a
heuristic, and you're using it

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.720
as a thing to tell you whether
or not you're wasting your

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:05.830
time, if your heuristic
represents information that is

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:13.480
bogus or says this particular
path has more cost associated

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.460
with it than it actually does,
then it will lead you astray.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.320
Or you don't want to use a
heuristic that will prevent

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.040
you from using a path that
actually costs less than the

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.990
heuristic advertises.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.880
This is what's known as an
admissible heuristic.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.910
An admissible heuristic always
underestimates if it makes an

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.900
error in estimation about your
total distance to the goal.

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:44.040
All right.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.550
So at this point, I've covered
dynamic programming.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.520
I've covered costs.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.130
I've covered heuristics.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.810
And it turns out, you
can use all of these

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.010
techniques at the same time.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:58.800
When you use both cost and
heuristics, in combination,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.010
while evaluating your priority
queue, that's known as an

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.910
A-Star search.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.200
And you'll see a decent amount
of literature on A-Star.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.100
This covers all of the
intelligent improvements to

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.610
basic search that I will talk
about in this course.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.850
We hope you enjoyed 6.01.
