00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.880
PROFESSOR: Last time we
introduced poles.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.270
And in particular, we introduced
how to move from

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.590
the manipulation of feed-forward
and feedback

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.370
systems and the geometric
sequence that fell out into

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.240
using the base of that geometric
sequence to attempt

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.010
to predict the long-term
behavior of the system.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.600
When we're solving for poles and
we're only interested in

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.320
long term behavior, one of the
easiest ways to do so to solve

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.770
for the roots of z, where z is a
substitution for 1 over R in

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.230
the denominator of the
system function.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.380
Once we've done that, we
have a list of poles.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.990
From that list of poles, we
would like to select, the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.400
dominant pole, or the pole with
the greatest magnitude,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.820
and then based on the magnitude
and period of that

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.540
pole we can determine what the
long term behavior of our

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.790
system looks like.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.620
Today I'd like to mention
to you some notable

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.150
things about poles.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.730
If you are interested in this
information or feedback and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.130
controls in the general sense,
I highly recommend 6.003.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.340
But here's some information you
should at least be aware

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.400
of as a consequence of 6.01.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130
The other thing I would like to
do is just walk through a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.940
couple of pole problems to
familiarize you, or get you

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.740
more comfortable with the idea
of solving for the poles of a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.450
system function, or looking at
the unit sample response of a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.670
system function and then
graphing the poles.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.450
The first thing that I want
to mention is pole-zero

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.450
cancellation.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.990
And what do I mean
when I say that?

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:40.950
I mean that if both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.970
have a degree of R in them, then
you're going to have both

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.420
a zero and a pole.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.740
If the zero and the pole have
the same value associated with

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.590
them, you may be tempted
to cancel them out.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.740
Unless both the zero and the
pole are equal to 0 --

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.230
don't do it.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.720
The reason why is that when you
get to a implementation of

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.300
a real system, it is highly
unlikely that both the zero

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.170
and the pole will be implemented
to a degree of

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.320
accuracy that you will actually
see those two things

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.190
cancel out.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.640
The only exception to this is
when both the pole and the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.140
zero are equal to 0,
or in this case.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.990
This you should feel free
to convert to this.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.880
In almost any other situation,
don't factor.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280
The other thing I want to talk
about is repeated roots.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.540
If you have a repeated root,
you'll have repeated poles.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.370
This does get tricky when you're
talking about how to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.290
add the unit response
of those poles.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.330
But the long term behavior
of your system is

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.640
going to look the same.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.090
So if both of these poles are
the dominant pole, then the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.240
characteristics of both, which
are the same, are going to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.060
determine what your long term
behavior looks like.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.930
If they're not, then the
dominant pole is going to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.630
determine what your long term
behavior looks like.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.910
The last thing I want to mention
is superposition.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.490
So far we've only talked about
the unit sample response of a

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.430
system function and how we use
poles to determine what the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.500
long term behavior of our
system's going to be.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.730
We can look at the response to
more complicated inputs than

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.160
the unit sample response,
or the delta.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.850
In fact, one of the things we'
probably end up looking at

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.380
some point is the
step function.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.570
The thing that you need to know
to go from talking about

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.940
unit sample response to any
other sort of response, is

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.820
that we're still working
with an LTI system.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.589
What that means is if you take
the summation of your inputs,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.649
and apply the system function
to that summation, it is the

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:27.300
same as the output that would
result from inputting all

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.550
those values at once.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.500
The best way I would like to
explain it is by referring

00:04:41.500 --> 00:05:04.990
again to if your function was
a system function, the same

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.240
property applies.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.730
Now let's walk through
a pole problem.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.170
Here I have a second order
system set up.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:25.700
We've got two degrees of R. I
have feedback, and I can solve

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.540
for an expression of
y in terms of x.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.320
In fact, let's do
that right now.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.960
y is the result of the
summation or a linear

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:48.900
combination of x plus a delayed
signal of y scaled by

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:58.710
1.6 in a linear combination with
a delayed value of the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:10.020
delayed value of y scaled
by negative 0.63.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.270
There's my first degree.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.150
For consistency's sake, there's
my second degree.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.380
Let's first solve for
the system function.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.600
If you're confused, I recommend
doing the algebra

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.520
from here to this expression.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.770
You should get this
fraction out.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.510
Our second step is to solve
for the roots of z.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:27.210
Remember that z is equal to 1
over R in the denominator of

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.460
the system function.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.085
In this case, we'll
be working with--

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.885
all I've done there is taken
every degree of R, substitute

00:07:56.885 --> 00:07:58.740
it in for 1/z.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.120
and then multiply it out, so
that I'm not working with z in

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.370
the denominator anymore.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.730
I'm actually just working with
everything in the numerator.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.930
If I follow this back out,
I get this expression.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.150
And my poles are going
to be 0.7 and 0.9.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:42.460
All right, based on my poles,
what are the properties of the

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.380
unit sample response
in the long term?

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.190
First thing I'm going to do is
look for the dominant pole

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.990
among the poles that I found.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.530
In this case, I don't even have
to worry about finding

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.680
the length of the distance from
the origin for poles in

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.940
the complex plane.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.890
All I have to worry about
is the magnitude of

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.070
poles on the real axis.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.700
0.9 is my dominant pole, because
it's the largest pole.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.010
0.9 is less than 1.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.670
So I'm going to end up
with convergence.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.630
Eventually, my system is
going to converge, or

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.880
tend towards 0.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.180
The other interesting property
of my system is what is its

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.780
period, how does that relate
to what my function's

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.400
going to look like.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.430
In this case, we're only working
on the positive real

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.390
axis, so the angle associated
with graphing this pole on the

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.470
complex plane is 0, so there is
no period for our system.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.140
This means that our system
is going to converge

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.390
monotonically.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.080
Now let's walk through some unit
sample responses and then

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.620
graph the poles that generated
those unit sample responses on

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.922
the unit circle, where this
is the complex plane.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.190
Let's look at this
graph first.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.670
The first thing that I notice
about this graph is that, like

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.500
in the previous example, we have
monotonic convergence.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.260
We're tending towards 0, and
we're not alternating or

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.510
oscillating about the x-axis.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.870
So I know I'm going to be
working somewhere along this

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.240
line before the edge
of the unit circle.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.990
Because at the edge of the unit
circle, the distance from

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.070
the origin is equal to 1.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.010
If you made me guess, then I
would look at the distance

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.485
here and compare it
to the distance at

00:10:57.485 --> 00:10:58.735
the next time step.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.920
I realize this is
a blackboard.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.320
It's not entirely to scale.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.440
But for the purposes of this
demonstration, I'd like to say

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.220
that the signal at this time
step is 0.5 the signal from

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.670
the previous times.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.240
Likewise at the next time step,
I would like to say that

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.600
this signal is 0.5 the signal
from the previous time step,

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.130
and so on and so forth.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.050
Therefore, I'm going to graph
my pole right here.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.620
Let's take a look
at this graph.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.470
I've drawn these squiggles to
indicate that the unit sample

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.420
response exceeds the bounds
of the space that I

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.610
gave for this graph.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.630
So just assume that these values
are much larger than

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.880
I've drawn them.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:00.830
The first thing that I notice
about this unit sample

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:06.590
response graph is the fact that
not only am I increasing

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:13.610
in a way that does not seem
to change in any way--

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:14.860
we're going to end
up diverging--

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.465
is that I'm actually alternating
about the x-axis.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.730
And that particularly, that
if I were to call this an

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.160
oscillation, then I
would say it's an

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.410
oscillation with period 2.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.840
This means that I'm working
with a negative real pole.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.860
The fact that I'm diverging
means I'm working with a

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:46.170
negative real pole that has
magnitude greater than 1.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.860
If you had to make me guess, I
would look at the distance

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.860
associated with this time
step, compare it to the

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.520
distance associated with
this time step.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:08.290
And if you had to ask me, I
would say this is about 1.3

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.460
the value at the
previous step.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.010
Likewise, if I were to look at
the next time step, I would

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.200
say that this increase
is about 30% of

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.450
the previous value.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.150
I'm not even going
to try that one.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.110
But what I'm trying to get
at is that you can use

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.180
comparisons of previous and
future time steps in order to

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.020
attempt to determine the
magnitude of the pole if

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.430
you're working with the
first order system.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.100
If you're working with the
second order system, then it's

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.080
possible that you'll see
some really interesting

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.790
initialization effects.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.580
And you should probably ask
one of us what's up.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.530
But for this example,
we're going to put

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.780
our pole over here.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.010
Here's the last graph I
want to talk about.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:09.400
The first thing that I notice is
that it doesn't seem to be

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.750
diverging, but it doesn't
really seem to

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.550
be converging either.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.990
If this is the case, then
I'm going to put

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.350
it on the unit circle.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.950
The second thing that I notice
is that it's not monotonic and

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.960
it's not alternating.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.030
This is oscillating.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.050
So in order to determine what
angle I'm going to sign to my

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.350
unit simple response, I'm going
to count out the time

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.260
steps that it takes to cycle
through an entire period and

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.390
then from there figure out what
the angle would have to

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.620
be in order to determine a
period of that length.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.140
So I start here.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.505
I'm just going to count 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 --

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.400
to complete one full
oscillation.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.330
This means that my
period is 8.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.590
If I have to divide 2pi by a
particular angle in order to

00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:01.680
get out 8, I want to
divide by pi/4.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.470
So at this point, I'm working
with a magnitude of about 1,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.670
and I want this angle
to be about pi/4.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.380
This concludes my tutorial
on solving poles.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.070
Next time, we'll end up talking
about circuits.
