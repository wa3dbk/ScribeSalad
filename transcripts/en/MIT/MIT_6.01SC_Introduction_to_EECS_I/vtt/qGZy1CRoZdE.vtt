KENDRA PUGH: Hi.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.800
Today, I'd like to talk
to you about circuits.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.290
Last time, we finished up the
LTIs, and signals, and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.140
systems, where we learned how to
both model existing systems

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.950
and predict their long-term
behavior.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.620
But we haven't forayed into how
to actually create systems

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.600
in the physical world.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.510
We've created some amount of
systems in software and made

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.720
some brains for our robots.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.400
But if we want to make something
in the physical

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.110
world, then we probably have to
come up with ways to model

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.770
physical systems or use
physical components.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.440
That starts our new
model on circuits.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.060
Circuits are going to be our
first foray into designing

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.630
systems in the physical world,
also designing systems using

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.080
physical components.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
It's worth mentioning now that
the information that you learn

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.260
about circuits is good for more

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.020
things than even circuits.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.770
You can use basic circuit
diagrams and properties of

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.390
circuits to model all sorts of
kinds of systems, especially

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.610
ones in the human body--

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.910
circulatory system, neurological
system, different

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.660
kinds of fluid flow,
that kind of thing.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.170
In the next few videos, we'll
go over how to represent

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.150
circuits, and also cover some of
the basic methods by which

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.500
people solve circuits.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.150
We'll also introduce an element
called an op-amp, and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.020
use that element in order to
enable us to do things like

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.595
modularity and abstraction
from our circuits.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.490
First, let's talk about
representation.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.030
In the general sense, when you
come across a circuit diagram,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.150
you're going to see--

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.530
at the very broad level--

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.320
a bunch of elements and a bunch
of connections between

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.670
the elements.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.950
Those things will form
loops and nodes.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.500
If you don't actually specify
the elements, then your

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.085
circuit diagram actually
looks a whole lot

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:00.060
like a block diagram.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.590
And in fact, block diagrams and
circuit diagrams are very

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.550
closely related in part because
block diagrams are

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.940
used to model feedback systems,
which frequently are

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.520
implemented using circuits.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.580
In this course, we're going to
be focusing on independent

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.840
sources and resistors as the
two major kinds of elements

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.540
that we'll use in
our circuits.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.020
We'll also use things like
potentiometers, which are

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.910
resistors that you can
adjust, and op-amps.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.240
And we'll look at op-amps
specifically in a later video.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.440
But I have one drawn up here
just so you recognize it when

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.480
you see it written.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.360
Note that it looks a whole lot
like the block diagram symbol

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.940
for a gain.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.370
And that's intentional, and
we'll cover that later.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.690
But in the meantime, the other
sources that we're going to be

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.310
using are independent current,
and voltage sources.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.710
We're going to use resistors
to adjust the amount of

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.307
voltage and current that we're
actually dealing with and then

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:03.220
sample either the current or
the voltage at a particular

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.370
point in our circuit
to get the desired

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.250
values that we're after.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.020
On a circuit diagram, when
you're interested in the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.860
voltage drop across a particular
element, you'll

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.170
indicate it by putting a
plus and minus sign.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.810
This also indicates
the directionality

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.530
of the voltage drop.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.000
Likewise, when you're interested
in the current

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.480
flowing through a particular
element, you'll usually see an

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.990
indication of it by labeling the
current i, and then maybe

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.660
i with some sort of subscript,
and an arrow indicating the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.610
direction of current flow
through that element so that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.690
you avoid making sign errors
with the person that might be

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.940
reading or writing
your diagram.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.510
A quick note here.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.090
This is the reason that
electrical engineers use j to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.630
symbolize values in
the complex plane.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.680
It's because i is used
in particular

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.960
for values of current.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.630
Let's review Kirchhoff's voltage
laws and Kirchhoff's

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.270
current laws.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.550
You've probably covered this
in 8.02, electricity and

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.400
magnetism, or possibly in
an AP physics class.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.358
But we're going to go over
it really fast right now.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.200
Kirchhoff's voltage law is that
the voltage drop around a

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.940
loop is equal to 0.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.650
Or if you take the voltage drop
across a particular loop

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.450
in your circuit, the sum
of those voltage drop

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.430
is going to be 0.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.530
Let's demonstrate
on this diagram.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.780
Or, I'll demonstrate
on this diagram.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.690
Say the voltage drop
across this element

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.960
is equal to V, right?

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.250
Doesn't matter what it is.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.980
We're going to stick
with that.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:00.400
The voltage drop across these
elements, if I were to move

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.340
around this loop, is
going to sum to 0.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.540
Note that if I'm tracing out
my voltage drop across this

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.070
loop, I'm actually moving
through this voltage source in

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.320
the direction opposite of
its indicated potential.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.700
So when I move through this
voltage source, I'm going to

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.630
account for its value as
negative V. As I work my way

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.440
around the rest of the circuit,
the voltage drop

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.930
across these elements is
going to sum to V.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.640
This is true for all loops
in my circuit.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:59.890
So any loop that includes V, the
elements I encounter as a

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:09.130
consequence of moving around
that loop are going to have

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.330
voltage drop equal and opposite
to the value I get by

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.580
moving through V in
this direction.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.870
This loop counts, too, but it
doesn't include V. All this

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.790
loop tells me is that the
voltage drop across this

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.110
element is equivalent
to the voltage

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.880
drop across this element.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.380
Or, the voltage drop in this
direction across that element

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.110
is equal to the voltage
drop in this

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.810
direction across this element.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.380
That's Kirchhoff's
voltage law.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.700
Kirchhoff's current law is that
the current flow into a

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.830
particular node is equal to 0.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.360
Or, if you take all of the
current flows in and out of a

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.150
particular node and sum them,
they should sum to 0.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.790
I've actually got the
same set up here.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.700
I'm not going to use
a current divider.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.510
I'm interested in the current
flowing over this element.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.400
It's actually the same as the
current flowing over this

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.210
element because resistance
doesn't change current,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.740
resistors flowing through
a resistor should

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.990
not change the current.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.220
So this is still the same i.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.470
Here's my node.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.730
The current flowing in this
direction and in this

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.520
direction, if I took the linear
combination of these

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.030
two currents, they would be
equal in value to the current

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.280
flowing into this node.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.640
When I'm looking at the current
flowing through a

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.610
particular node, I
pick a direction.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.730
It's usually arbitrary.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.450
I pick a direction.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.580
It's arbitrary which
direction I pick.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.200
Typically, you pick currents
flowing into the

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.450
node as being positive.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.960
I sum up all the currents, and
I set that equal to 0.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.210
So in this case--.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.309
Or--

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.200
pretty simple.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.390
Let's practice on this
particular circuit.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.640
One thing to note is that when
you're solving circuits in the

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.600
general sense, both when you
want TA help and when you're

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.620
solving for a mid-term and want
partial credit, you want

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:22.980
to label all of your nodes, all
of your elements, and all

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.940
of the currents that you're
interested in solving.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.480
See, I've got my voltage drop
across this resistor, this

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.760
resistor, and this resistor
labeled, as well as these

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.520
currents, which I'll also
be solving for.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.260
The first thing that I would
do when approaching this

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:49.680
problem is attempt to reduce
this circuit to something that

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.280
is a little bit simpler.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.170
The first thing that I'm going
to do is try to figure out how

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.670
to change these two resistors
in parallel into a single

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.830
resistor and still have
an equivalent circuit.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.230
That'll allow me to
solve for I1.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.700
There will be 0 nodes
in my system.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.570
I'll just have one
single loop.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:21.050
And the current through the
system will just be V/R.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.550
So if I'm just looking at these
two resistors, I have

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:24.800
resistors in parallel.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.230
In the general sense, the way
to solve for resistors in

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:39.330
parallel is to take
the inverse of the

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.580
sum of their inverses.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.140
When you only have two
resistors, you can typically

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:58.900
cheat by saying that this
is equal to their

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.960
product over their sum.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.620
I'm going to redraw my current
understanding of the circuit.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:50.410
The other stuff that I've saved
myself is that because

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.680
these resistors are
in parallel,

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.280
they're a current divider.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.780
They take the current in and
divide it two ways determined

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.650
by the ratio between
these two values.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.940
The thing I'm actually
interested in expressing is

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.740
that V2 and V3 are
the same value.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.190
When you have a current divider,
the voltage drop

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.590
across all elements in the
current divider are the same.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:22.590
So the value of V here is going
to be both V2 and V3.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.720
2R plus 6/5 R. I'm going to
go with 16/5 R for now.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:19.330
I've solved for I.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.160
At this point, I have a voltage
divider, which means

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.870
that the current flowing through
this part of the

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:25.830
system is going to
be the same.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:33.150
But the voltage drop across
this element versus this

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.830
element is going to be
proportional to the ratio

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.320
between these two values.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.770
V1 is going to be the amount
of the total resistance in

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:16.750
this simple circuit that this
resistor contributes over the

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.450
entire resistance
in the system.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:28.350
Or, 10/5 R over 16/5 R, which is
10/16 R, or 5/8 R. Or, it's

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:52.070
going to be 5/8 V.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.447
Same thing happens with V2.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.530
Note that these two values
should sum to V in order to

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.000
maintain Kirchoff's
voltage law.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.960
We've also found V3.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.390
So the two things that we have
to find are I2 and I3.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.310
Here, I've just done
Kirchoff's current

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.560
law for this node.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.800
Because I'm working with a
current divider, I can break

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.250
up the total current flowing
into that node into the number

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:16.110
of parts equal to the sum
of these values and then

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.780
distribute them.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.760
And then, that's
[? inappropriate ?]

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.450
given that less resistance
means more current.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.990
What do I mean by that?

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:29.040
Well, I mean that here my
current is equal to 5/16 V

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:45.580
over R. I2 is going to be equal
to this value over the

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:52.190
sum of these two values
times I1.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.590
Likewise--.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.220
And just to simplify--.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.700
That concludes my tutorial
on circuits.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.550
Next time, we'll talk about
other ways we can solve this

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.650
circuit, and then we'll end
up talking about op-amps.
