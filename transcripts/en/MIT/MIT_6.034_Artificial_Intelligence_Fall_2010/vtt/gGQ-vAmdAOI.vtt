00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:12.180
PROFESSOR: It was written about
Route 66, which used to

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.640
be the main highway between
Chicago, Illinois and Los

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.610
Angeles, California.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.860
Very famous highway because
anybody who wanted to go

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.550
across country always took route
66 because it was the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.950
shortest way to go.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.620
And the question is, how do you
find the shortest path?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.760
Not just any old path or a good
path, but how do you find

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.230
the very shortest path?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.764
And that'll be the subject
that we're

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:38.660
going to discuss today.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.560
But route 66, I lament its
passing, but it's been largely

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.570
replaced by the interstate
highway system that was

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.350
created by President
Eisenhower.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.600
Guess why?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.860
Let's see, maybe the
ROTC people know.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.840
You know why Eisenhower
created the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.800
interstate highway system?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.670
Well, in public affairs, of
course, there's always a

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.420
distinction to be
made between the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.990
explanation and the reason.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.276
The explanation was--

00:01:13.276 --> 00:01:16.463
AUDIENCE: To move weapons
across the country?

00:01:16.463 --> 00:01:17.560
PROFESSOR: Well,
to move nuclear

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.700
weapons across the country.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Let's put it in, sightly,
more benign terms.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.240
Eisenhower had observed that
the German army was able to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.950
move its troops rapidly, even
though we bombed their

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.910
railroads into oblivion because
of their auto bond.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.473
So Eisenhower conceived that if
there were ever an invasion

00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:39.600
in the United States, we too
would want to be able to move

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.300
our forces around on
a highway system.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.340
And consequence of that, we
have a pretty good highway

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.010
system and pretty awful
railroad system.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.060
It's interesting.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.410
I'm a beneficiary of that, in a
funny way, because I'm from

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.050
East Peoria, Illinois.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.600
And I was surrounded by the
factors of Caterpillar Tractor

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.725
Company, which made all of the
tractors that built all of

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:01.990
those roads.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.180
So my high school spent money
like water from that huge tax

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.270
base of all those factors.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.990
Anyway, today we want to find
the very best path, instead of

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.550
just a good path.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:26.050
And like the last time, we'll
deal with, both, an example

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.640
that we can set our program
to work on.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.180
By the way, can you find the
shortest path between S and G?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.885
Would you like to bet your
life on the shortest path

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.000
between S and G?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.920
Probably, not.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.600
With your eye, you can
find a good path.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.020
But you can't find the
best possible path.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.500
Today, what we're doing is
probably not modeling any

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.550
obvious property of what we
have inside our heads.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.610
But being able to find the best
path is part of the skill

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.260
set that anybody who's had a
course artificial intelligence

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.270
would be expected to have.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.010
So we're going to look at it,
even though it's not like many

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.170
of the things we do.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.660
A model of something
that's, probably,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.520
going on in your head.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.710
So we're going to use, both,
this example from Cambridge

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.450
and our Blackboard example.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.800
Let's see, we have to
caution ourselves.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.320
Tanya, is search about maps?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.690
No, it's about what?

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.830
Starts with a C. And the next
letter is H. And it ends up

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.750
being choice.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.460
So we're talking about choice.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.240
Not about maps.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.150
Even though our examples are
drawn from maps because

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.410
they're convenient, they're
visual, and helps understand

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.190
the concepts behind the
algorithms I'm talking about.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.390
So let's start off by looking
at our classroom example.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.570
And I did something today that
I neglected to do last time.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.030
And that's talk to you
about what I meant

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.810
by heuristic distance.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.350
It's those pink lines that
I just drew on the map.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.130
We're talking about the distance
as the crow would fly

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.520
between two places, even though
there's no road that

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.200
goes between those two places.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.100
So in general, and we discussed
last time, it's best

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.950
to get yourself into a place
that's close, as the crow

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.170
flies, to your goal.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.740
And of course, that's a
heuristic and it can get you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.020
in trouble because it's
not always true.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.630
It would appear that being at
node E is a good place to be

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.040
because it's not very far from
G. But in that particular case

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.030
designed to illustrate the
point, being close is,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.770
actually, not a good thing
because it's a dead end.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.110
But in general, it's a good
thing to be close.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.150
And we talked last time about
hill climbing and beam search,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.580
being close was the objective
of those kinds of searches.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060
And at one point, in a beam
search illustration, we had C,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.980
B, A, and D. We had paths
terminating at all four of

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.980
those nodes as candidates for
the next round of search.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.660
And we decided on the basis of
these airline distances to

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.720
keep D and B, and reject A and C
because they're further away

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.060
as the crow flies.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.340
Now, I repeat this even though
many of you have had this

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.790
fixed already in your tutorials
because we're going

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.450
to need this concept of
heuristic distance today.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.250
And I wanted to be sure that
that point has been clarified.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.030
So now, with this smaller map I
imagine you can do, by eye,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.580
a determination of what
the shortest path is.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.230
What is it, Juana?

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.584
Can you help me out with that?

00:05:41.584 --> 00:05:43.800
AUDIENCE: S, A, D, G.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.820
PROFESSOR: S, A, D, G. And if
you add up those distances,

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:54.430
the distance is 11 along that
path that goes from S, first

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.640
to A, and then to D, and then
from D to G. So Juana asserts

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.860
that that is the best path.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.540
And we're going to treat Juana
as an Oracle because we're

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.830
going to follow, in our initial
attempt to understand

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.590
these algorithms,
a very important

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.020
principle of problem solving.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.770
And that is that, if you want
to solve a problem, the

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.810
easiest way is, usually, ask
somebody who knows the answer.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.290
Or Google, which also, probably,
knows the answer.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.290
So in this particular case,
we believe that

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:26.270
Juana knows the answer.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.170
And she said that the shortest
path is S,A, D, G, and its

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.310
path length is 11.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.680
But we don't trust her because
we're applying to the same

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.673
medical school and she may
be trying to screw us.

00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:42.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.380
PROFESSOR: So we're going to
be very cautious about

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.320
accepting her answer until we've
checked it to make sure

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.750
that she hasn't attempted
to delude us.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.970
So how do we go about
doing that?

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.490
Well, one way to do that is to
check to be sure that all

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.380
other possible paths that we
could develop end up being,

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.700
for sure, longer than the one
that Juana has told us about.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:16.910
So she's told us about S, A, D,
G. And it has a total path

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.610
length of 11.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.500
And now what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to develop

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.995
the rest of this tree-like
diagram.

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:28.380
But what I'm going to do is,
I'm not going to do it in a

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.270
British Museum or random way.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.830
What I'm going to do is, I'm
going to look at the choice

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.960
that corresponds the shortest
path that can be extended.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.160
So the shortest path that
can be extended is

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.620
this one right here.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.480
The one that just has the
starting node in it.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.880
And I could have gone this other
way to B. And if I go

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.870
that other way to B, then
the path length along

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.240
that side is 5.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.760
And likewise, if I look at the
path that terminates in A,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.950
that has a path length of 3.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.300
So now I've got two choices.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.710
A and B. I've got choices
that extend

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.170
beyond those two places.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.640
So I'm always going to
extend the one that

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.250
has the shorter length.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.450
So in this case, that would be
the path that goes from S to

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.380
A.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.480
So if I from S to A, I don't
have to go to D. I can also go

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:33.429
to B. And if I go to B, then the
accumulated path length is

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.120
S, A, B. That's 7.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.120
And know that we're talking now
about the path, like the

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.430
accumulated path length, that
we've traveled so far.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.120
Last time we were talking
a lot about

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.220
distances to the goal.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.340
Heuristic estimates of how
far we are from the goal.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.500
Now we're doing exactly
the opposite.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.570
We're not considering how
far we've got to go.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.450
We're only thinking about how
far we've gone so far.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.830
So now, repeating these
steps again.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.660
I've got 7 and 5.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.790
So I'll go over and consider
the choices that go through

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:16.360
the B node on the path S, B. And
that gives me S, B, A and

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.440
S, B, C. And what are
those path lengths?

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.480
Well, let's see.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.200
S, B, A would be 9.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.620
And S, B,C would be 9.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.740
And now the shortest path
is this one over here.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.430
So I extend that.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.280
I go S, A, B. S, A, B. The only
place I can go is C. That

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.150
adds another 4.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.280
So that's 11.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.690
And what do I know
about that path?

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.770
I don't have to take that
any further, right?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.350
Because the path length, since
I've gone on that path

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.690
already, is equal to the path
length that Juana has told me

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.240
gets me to the goal.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.110
So it'll be foolhardy to carry
on because, presuming that

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.810
these lengths are all
non-negative, I

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.270
can't do any better.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.270
And I can't even do as well,
unless I've got a length that

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.440
has 0 length.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.820
So now that I have that idea,
I can quickly finish up by

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.570
saying, well, let me consider
these two paths.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:23.982
S, B, A can only go to D. And
if I go to D, that adds 3.

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:27.550
9 plus 3 is 12.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.750
Nothing else can happen there
because that's 12 and I've got

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.470
a path of a goal that's 11.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.500
C, I can only go to E. It's a
dead-end but I don't have to

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.640
think about that because I
know that the accumulated

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.730
distance along this
path is 6 plus 9.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.640
That's 15.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.740
So all of these need not be
extended any further because

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.090
their length, accumulated so
far, is equal to or less than

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.500
a length of a goal.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.380
So I've checked the Oracle.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.120
And although we're applying to
the same medical school, Juana

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.400
has told me the truth.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.835
So now, unfortunately, Juana's
not always around.

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.690
And I don't always
have an Oracle.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:15.030
So I'm going to have to have
some way of finding the

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.440
shortest path without
that Oracle

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.210
that I can check against.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.190
Let's see.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.440
What can I do?

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.430
Maybe I can do the same
thing I just did.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.150
Always extend the shortest path
so far and hope that I

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.630
run into the goal
at some point.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.800
And then I have to ask myself
the question how much extra

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.210
work did I need to do when
I don't have the Oracle?

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.760
Let's just try it and
see what happens.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.400
You don't have that
path to start.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.400
So I just have S. This
distance is 0.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.590
I can go either to A or B.
If I go to A, I've got

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.080
a distance of 3.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.410
Here, I've got a
distance of 5.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.550
I'll extend the path that goes
S, A. That can either got to B

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:10.360
or D. Going to B or D
gives me 7 that way.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.200
S, A, D gives me 6.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.690
So looking across all of these
and extending the shortest

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:24.980
path so far takes me back over
to S, B. So I extend those.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:30.510
S, B takes me to A or C.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.550
And those, in turn, have
total accumulated path

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.880
lengths of 9 and 9.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.390
Now the shortest one is S, A,
D. You see the pattern.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.890
Now let's see.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.930
I haven't found the goal yet.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.720
So I can ask myself the question
is any of the work

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.190
that I've done so far wasted?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.710
No because all of the paths
that I've got so far are

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.750
shorter than the path of the
goal because the goal

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.700
hasn't shown up.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.230
So when I do my oracle checking
after I found the

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.220
goal, none of that work's
going to be wasted.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.120
So in the end, I don't,
actually, need the Oracle.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.760
I could just develop this
graph by extending the

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.390
shortest path, so far,
until I hit the goal.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.030
And then, perhaps, do a little
remaining checking to make

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.610
sure that all the other paths
extend with a length that's

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.970
greater than the path
of the goal.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.855
So if those words are confusing,
let's carry on with

00:13:26.855 --> 00:13:30.000
the algorithm, and I think
it'll be clearer.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.390
So let's see.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.490
We've got the 7,
6, and two 9s.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:35.530
We're going to extend
the one that's 6.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.900
That gets this to the goal.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.690
Boom, we've got it.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.230
And we've got a path
length of 11.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.040
Note, though, we can't quit
because we have to be sure

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.300
that all other paths
are longer than 11.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.530
So now we have to carry on with
the same algorithm that

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.580
we started with.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.630
The Oracle checking algorithm.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.460
And when we do that, we look
for this shortest path, so

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.650
far, that has not
been extended.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:08.360
That's B, S, A, B. That
goes to C. That's 11.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.010
So we're done there.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.600
A goes to D. That adds 3.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.630
That's 12.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.390
C goes to E. That adds 6.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.050
That's 15.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.020
And sure enough, we're done.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.270
OK?

00:14:26.296 --> 00:14:27.742
Elliot?

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.810
AUDIENCE: Does it know that
there's know that there isn't

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.110
a chance that you could have a
zero distance extension from

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.460
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.302
PROFESSOR: The question is, does
it know that there's no

00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:44.510
zero distance length
that's coming up.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.400
That's an implementation
detail.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.010
This guarantees you'll find a
path that's as short as any

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.320
that you can possibly find.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.580
But there might be others if
they're zero-length lengths.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.580
As long as they're non-negative

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:58.020
lengths, we're safe.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.740
We've got a shortest path.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.670
So that was easy.

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.560
And now we can repeat the
exercise with our more

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.490
complicated map of Cambridge.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.000
First of all, let's do depth
first just to recall what that

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.610
looks like.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.210
That is, certainly,
not a short path.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:22.270
So let's try this idea, which,
by the way, bares the label

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.110
branch inbound.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.740
Let's try branch inbound
on the same map.

00:15:30.226 --> 00:15:32.040
And there it goes.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:35.720
Each of those little flickers
is trying another path.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.590
So you can see it's working
it's guts out to find the

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.840
shortest path.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.870
It's almost there but it's
almost a pathological case.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.410
Or it's almost doing
British Museum.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.620
There it's finally found
the shortest path.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.190
Now there are some things
we can ask about that.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.910
But first of all, before I ask
anything about it, I'd like to

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.250
get the flow chart up on the
board because we're going to

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:15.100
decorate that flow chart,
a little bit, as we go.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.140
So the first thing we do
is initialize queue.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:31.310
Then we're going to test first
path on the queue.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.650
Then we might be happy because
we might be done.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.030
We might have a shortest
path to the goal.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.650
Actually, that's not
quite true, is it?

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.070
We can't really quit until
every other path is it.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.320
Well, that's interesting.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.370
If the first element on the
queue gets us all the way to

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.500
the goal, and we sorted our
queue by path length, are we

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.680
through as soon as that first
element on the queue gets us

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.111
to the goal?

00:17:09.111 --> 00:17:11.640
Yeah because every other
path must have been

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.230
sorted beyond it.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:18.839
And therefore, it can't offer us
a shorter path to the goal.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:22.550
So if the first path is a path
to the goal we're done.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.190
Alas, it usually isn't.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.490
So we'll extend first path.

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:39.790
We're going to put all those
extensions back on the queue,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.290
and then we're going
to sort them.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.340
So that's, pretty much, the
same as we did last time.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.610
We're always going to put the
elements back on the queue.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.150
We're going to look at the first
element the queue and

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.360
see if it's a winner.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.430
If it is we're done.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.520
If it's not, we're going
to extend it.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.787
And then go back in here
and try again.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:10.900
Well, sort of.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.600
But we noted that this did a
awful lot of work because if

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.970
we look at those statistics
up there, it put 1,354

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.210
paths onto the queue.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.210
That's the N queueing part.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.690
And then it extended 835,000
paths that had come to the

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.940
front of the queue.

00:18:32.496 --> 00:18:37.590
Now I'd like to give you an
aside because it's easy to get

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.890
confused about N queueing
and extending.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.110
In all of the searches we did
last time, it would have been

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.660
perfectly reasonable to keep a
list of all the paths that we

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.444
had put onto the queue.

00:18:51.444 --> 00:18:53.850
An N queueing list.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:00.540
And never add a path to our
queue if it terminates in a

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:05.820
node that some other path
terminate in that has already

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.110
gone to the queue.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.820
What I said last time was let
us keep track of the things

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.900
that have been extended and
not extend them again.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.830
So you can either keep track
of the nodes that have been

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.980
extended and not extend
them again.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.290
Or look at the paths with nodes
that terminate, and

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.570
blah, blah, blah and been put on
the queue, the queued ones.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.380
And not put things back
on the queue again.

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.535
And I think, last time, I may
have put a column in there

00:19:33.535 --> 00:19:34.190
that said N queued.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:39.090
It should have been extended.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.840
Even though N queued worked last
time, only extended works

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.690
this time because we want to
be sure that anything we

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.070
extend is a short path.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:54.370
So the N queued idea doesn't
work, at all, for these

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.910
optimal paths.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.840
So now I want to come back over
here off the side bar and

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.945
say that we're keeping track
of all of the nodes, all of

00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:07.040
the paths that end in nodes
unless they have already been

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.640
extended beyond that
particular place.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.590
So we need to decorate our
algorithm here and say test

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:24.470
first path and extend
the first path

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:31.180
if not already extended.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.740
Because you can see that in the
example I had, so far, we

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:43.130
did that same silliness that
we talked about last time.

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:49.030
We extended paths that
went through A more

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.310
than once, like so.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.470
Would it ever make sense
to extend this path?

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.860
No because we've already
extended a path that got there

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.780
with less distance.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.900
Will it ever make sense
to extend this path?

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.460
No because we've already
extended another path that

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.000
gets to be by a shorter
distance.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.040
So if we keep an extended
list, we can add that to

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.130
branch inbound to
our advantage.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.570
So let's see how that would work
on the classroom example.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:23.920
And then we'll do Cambridge.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.200
So this is bridge inbound,
plus an extended list.

00:21:33.414 --> 00:21:37.260
And I do mean extended.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.350
Not in the N queued list.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.600
N queued list won't work here.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.910
So let's see, I start off the
same way as I did before.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:52.200
S goes to either A or B.
That's a length of 3.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.980
That's a length of 5.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:05.100
So I extend A. That goes to
either B or D. But B is as if

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.690
it wasn't there at all.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:08.235
Oh, sorry.

00:22:08.235 --> 00:22:09.485
Hang on.

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.990
B goes there.

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:18.140
And those path lengths
are 7 and 6.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.260
And now I look around on the
board, and I say what is the

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.730
shortest path so far?

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:28.610
And it's B. So I extend that
to get to A and C with path

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.020
lengths of 9 and 9.

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.820
And what's the shortest
one next?

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.690
It's D. And that goes to G.
And the path length is 11.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.640
And what's the shortest
one on the board?

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.010
The one that has to
be extended next.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.690
That's this one that gets to B.
But I've already extended a

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.230
path that get to B. So I don't,

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.570
actually, do that extension.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.801
So I've saved some work.

00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:56.260
But I've got to go over here
and do these two now.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:56.610
But wait.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.770
I've already extended B. I've
already extended A, so I don't

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.930
have to do that one either.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.340
The only one I have to do is
the one that goes to C. And

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.950
that those then to E with
a path length of 15.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.670
And I'm done.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.760
So if you compare this one with
a previous one, you can

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.450
see that there might be vast
areas of this tree that are

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.250
pruned away and don't have
to be examined all.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.860
So now, just for the sake of
illustrating that, I would

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:24.740
like to keep track of just
one of those statistics.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.260
The number of extensions.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.420
So for this particular example,
case one, the number

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:35.330
of extensions was 835.

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:37.380
Why don't you see if you can
guess to yourself what it

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.360
would be if I use this concept
of an extended list.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.670
See, I'm not going to extend
anything I've already extended

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.420
because it's guaranteed to have
a longer path length then

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.200
something that already got
to that same place.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.790
So it makes no sense to do it.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:58.520
So let me change the type to
branch-and-bound with an

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.750
extended list.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.420
I'm going to turn the speed
down a little bit so

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.150
we can watch it.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:05.830
It might take the rest
of the hour.

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:07.080
Who knows?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.000
Still doing a lot of work.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.445
Still examining a
lot of paths.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.130
Well, look at that.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:33.200
Instead of 835 extensions
it only did 38.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.800
So that's a pretty substantial
savings.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.360
And you would never not
want to do that.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.370
So note that that's a layering
on top of branching out.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.300
That's not a different
algorithm.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.250
It's an adjustment improvement
to the algorithm, and it makes

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.500
it more efficient.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:55.490
So this whole thing is
based on what I call

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.130
the dead horse principle.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.980
As soon as we figure out that
a path that goes to a

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.640
particular place can't possibly
be the winning path,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.830
we get rid of it, and don't
bother extending it.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.330
It's a dead horse principle.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:18.830
But if we look at this example,
what's the shortest

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.350
possible length of a
path that's already

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.600
gone from S to B?

00:25:27.776 --> 00:25:29.204
What do you think, Tanya?

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.110
Well, first of all, it can't be
less than 5 because we've

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.390
already gone that distance.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.300
So when I say what's the
shortest length of any path

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.090
that there could possibly be
that goes from S to D. We know

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.420
it's at least 5.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.680
But can we say something
more about it?

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.140
Especially, when we look at
these airline distances, and

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.420
note that this airline distance
is 6, and that's a

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.150
little more than 7, and that's
a little more than 7.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:02.400
So what do you think?

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.270
So it's gone from S to B, and
the question is what's the

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:13.370
shortest path that could
possibly be that had started

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:14.620
out going from S to B?

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.780
11 right?

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:23.690
Because we can't have a path
that's shorter than the

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.630
airline distance.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.450
If there were a straight line
road from A to G, its length

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.320
would be 6.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.630
But there isn't.

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:37.740
So that gives us a lower bound
on the distance that we have

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.840
along that path.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.520
So we're using the accumulated
distance, plus the airline

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.980
distance, to give us a lower
bound on the path that we've

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.750
started off on that
goes from S to B.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.730
Once again, let's solidify a
little bit by simulating the

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.320
search and seeing how
it turns out.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.270
Not just I did last time, I'm
going to forget that I've got

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.510
an extended list.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.840
I don't want to carry both of
those things around with me at

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.270
the same time.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.620
So forget that we've got
an extended list.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.020
We'll bring all those back
together a little later.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.160
So we're going to forget
what we just did there.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.340
And instead we're just going
to use this concept of an

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.705
airline distance and
see what happens.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.910
As before we start with
a starting node.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:48.640
We have two choices as always.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.160
We can go to A or B. And the
accumulated distance, if we go

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.580
to A, is 3.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:58.350
And then accumulated distance
if we go to B is 5.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.280
But now we're going to add
in the airline distances.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.140
So the airline distance from A
to G is a little more than 7,

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.060
which is 10 plus.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.400
The airline distance from
B to G is exactly 6.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.010
So that gives us 11.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.070
And following the procedure
we've all been using already

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.120
so far, we're going to extend
the path that seems to have

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.560
the shortest potential.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.390
Now it's the shortest potential
distance S to G. So

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.970
that must be this one here.

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:41.480
So from A we can go to B
or D. The accumulated

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.065
distance S, A, B, is 7.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.550
The airline distance is 6,
so that's equal to 11.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.890
Standard arithmetic 13.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:05.280
The distance S, A, D. That is
6 plus a little more than 7.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.090
So what's the accumulated
distance?

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:18.810
S, A, D is 3 plus 3 is 6.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.177
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:22.925
PROFESSOR: What?

00:29:22.925 --> 00:29:25.565
AUDIENCE: The airline distance
from D would be 5.

00:29:25.565 --> 00:29:28.220
PROFESSOR: Would be 5, right.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.230
So airline distance, in this
case, is the same as the

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.310
actual distance.

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:33.190
So the accumulated
distance is 6.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.360
The actual distance is 5.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.610
So that's equal to 11.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.420
So now I've got two
11's on the board.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.740
And simulating what we'd ask
you do on a quiz, we don't

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.520
know which of those is
going to be better.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.300
They've got a tie score.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.810
So what we're going to do is
we're going to choose the one

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.510
that's lexically least.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:58.260
So B comes before D. So we'll
expand B. And that can go to

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:05.170
either A or C. And we have to
calculate the best possible

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.485
distance that goes along
those paths.

00:30:07.485 --> 00:30:14.670
The accumulated distance
S, B, A. S, B, A is 9.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:18.140
So that's 9 plus 7 plus.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.700
That's 16 plus.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.170
This has an accumulated
lead of distance of 9.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.190
Also plus 7 plus.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.060
Also 16 plus.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.000
Well, now let's see.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.940
Things are shaping up pretty
well because this one has the

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.000
lowest score so far.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.760
We extend that to
G. And now the

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.470
accumulated distance is 11.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.460
The airline distance
is 0, so that's 11.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.840
And that's smaller than
everybody else.

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.040
So we've got.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.700
So now compare this one with
our branch inbound graph.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:01.370
And you see, once again, we've
done considerably less work.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.850
And that, in many practical
cases, means that instead of

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:08.300
taking more than the remaining
lifetime of the universe to

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.760
complete the calculation, it can
happen in a few seconds.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.440
But let's see how it works
on the example.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.370
So I'm not going to use
the extended list.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:23.810
I'm just going to use this idea
of using a lower bound on

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:26.710
the distance remaining,
the airline distance,

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:27.960
and see what happens.

00:32:00.168 --> 00:32:02.980
So this time, the number
of extensions is 70.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.710
So it didn't do quite as well
as working alone as the

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.680
extended list did
working alone.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.160
So we immediately conclude that
the extended list is more

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.490
useful than using one of these
lower bound heuristics.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.570
By the way, this is called
an admissible heuristic.

00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:37.830
If the heuristic estimate is
guaranteed to be less than the

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.110
actual distance, that's called
an admissible heuristic.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:45.230
Admissible because you can use
it for this kind of purpose.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:51.940
So it looks like the day
extended list is a more useful

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.880
idea than the admissible idea.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.690
Right?

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.410
What do you think about
that, Brett?

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.195
Am I hacking?

00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:00.945
Am I joking?

00:33:00.945 --> 00:33:02.580
AUDIENCE: I think you're
judging prematurely.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.180
PROFESSOR: Why am I judging
prematurely?

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.390
What do you think it
might depend on?

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.055
AUDIENCE: The fact that we're
using extensions and the

00:33:08.055 --> 00:33:09.436
extended list pretty much
guarantees you can only extend

00:33:09.436 --> 00:33:12.054
each node once.

00:33:12.054 --> 00:33:15.945
PROFESSOR: Well, Brett has sad
something unintelligible that

00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:17.600
I can't think how to repeat.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.195
What he meant to say,
though, was that--

00:33:19.195 --> 00:33:22.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.770
PROFESSOR: --in these cases,
it almost always depends on

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.930
the problem itself.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.670
If you change the problem, you
may get a different result.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.370
So why don't we change the
problem and see if we get a

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.480
different result?

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.040
So instead of starting on the
extreme left, let's start in

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.380
the middle and see
what happens.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:45.880
So I'll readjust my starting
position to be right there.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.320
Oops, that's the wrong
adjustment.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:56.840
And we might as well start
by getting our baseline

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.315
branch-and-bound without
anything.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.580
And for that one, maybe, we'll
speed it up a little bit.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.000
So that gives us
57 extensions.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.250
It's an easier problem.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.080
So let's try it with the
admissible heuristic.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.210
That went too fast.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.610
Wow, still pretty fast.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:36.860
Six extensions.

00:34:39.382 --> 00:34:43.139
What do you think this
number's going to be?

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.989
Closer to six or closer to 57?

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:46.630
Better than six?

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.370
Worse than six?

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.889
Well, let's think.

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:54.100
What we're going to do is we're
going to just not repeat

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.080
any movements through
the same node again.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.360
But it's not going to
do something very

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.085
important for us.

00:35:00.085 --> 00:35:04.350
It's not going to keep us out
of the left side because it

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.930
has no idea of the remaining
airline distance to the goal.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:19.380
So let's see if that's
true It sure is.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.155
Look at that.

00:35:20.155 --> 00:35:23.100
It is, foolishly, spending
a lot of its' time doing

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.090
something we would never do.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.740
Namely, looking over there
on the left side.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:33.370
So this time, the number
of extensions is 35.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.860
So in case two, the admissible
heuristic

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.140
does very much better.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:43.920
In case one, the extension
thing does much better.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.450
But wait a minute, would we ever
not want to use both at

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.700
the same time?

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.660
We wouldn't want to use just
one of these, right?

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.230
They both have the possibility
of doing us a lot of good.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.190
So maybe if we put them in
harness together, we'll get

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:02.170
something that's even better.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.350
And when we do that--

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.870
see here, the extended list
is a layer on top

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:08.890
of branch and bound.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.200
The admissible heuristic
is another layer on top

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.250
of branch and bound.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:17.490
If we put those together, we get
something called A star.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:21.800
So A star is just branch and
bound, plus an extended list,

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.290
plus and admissible heuristic.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.750
So let's go back to our original
problem and try A

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:28.000
star on that.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.410
We're running this at a pretty
slow speed because we're

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.190
expecting it to be a lot more
efficient than the original

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.890
branch and bound.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:44.560
And sure enough it is.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.470
The number of extensions
is 27.

00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.910
So look at that.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.950
A lot better than either of
those working independently.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.750
Now I can stick the thing in
the center and see what

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.000
happens then.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:09.490
So in this particular case,
the extended list didn't,

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.090
actually, help us because our
admissible heuristic was

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.790
channeling us so tightly
toward the

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.360
goal it didn't matter.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.470
So it all depends on the nature
of the space that

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.160
you're trying to explore.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.870
By the way, you know how
the whole works, right?

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.210
So what you want to do is
you want to extend the

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.120
first path and sort.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.120
But not just by accumulated
distance.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:45.550
Sort by accumulated distance
plus admissible heuristic.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.090
But what are the
theoreticians?

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.550
You must be complaining.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.440
Sort's expensive.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.740
Do we actually need to sort?

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:04.960
No, we don't actually
need to sort.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.900
What do we to do?

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.141
AUDIENCE: We just need to keep
track of what's the minimum.

00:38:09.141 --> 00:38:09.946
PROFESSOR: We just need
to keep track

00:38:09.946 --> 00:38:10.530
of what's the minimum.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.130
So we don't need to, actually,
do that sort.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:16.670
That's an unnecessary
computation.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.770
So instead, we can test, not
the first path but the

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.020
shortest path.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.620
And now you have it.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.430
Now you have the whole
of A star.

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.650
And now you can go home, but I
don't think you should because

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:42.090
I'm about to show you that this
idea of admissibility,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.410
actually, leads to certain screw
cases that we're very

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.340
fond of asking about on exams.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.280
So it turns out that the
admissible heuristic, in

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.400
certain circumstances, could
get you into trouble.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.940
It doesn't look like it could
because, logically, nothing

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.480
I've said seems strange
or questionable.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.150
But that's because I've been
working with a map.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:06.100
And it turns out that if you
work with a map then

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.500
admissibility is a perfectly
sound way of

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.710
doing an optimal search.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.650
But, Travis, is search
just about maps?

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.130
No, search is not
just about maps.

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.545
So we may have non-Euclidean
arrangements that will cause

00:39:21.545 --> 00:39:22.710
us trouble.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.815
So I'd like to illustrate that
with the following example.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.100
It's not going to be a large
map or a large graph.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:43.866
S, then go up here to A or
down here to B. Then they

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:51.650
merge at C. And then they go
out here to the goal, G.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:58.810
And the actual distances
are 1, 1, 1, and 10.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.390
And over here, we'll
make that 100.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:05.340
So it's a kind of oddly
constructed map, but it's

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.240
there because we need a
pathological case to

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.510
illustrate the idea.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.590
Now that's the actual
distances.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.090
And if we did branch and down
with an extended list,

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.250
everything would
work just fine.

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:17.715
But we're not.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.530
We're going to use an admissible
heuristic.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.760
And we're going to say that
this guy has an estimated

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.480
distance to the goal of 100.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.830
This guy is 0.

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:30.240
And this guy is 0.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.500
Now, 0 is always an
underestimate of the actual

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.600
distance to the goal, right?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.970
So I'm always free to use 0.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.350
Is that 100 OK?

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:43.400
Yeah because the actual
distances is 101, so it's less

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.650
than that the actual distance.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:48.950
So it's OK as an admissible
heuristic.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:53.570
So these numbers that I put up
here, together, constitute an

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.300
admissible heuristic set of
estimates to the goal.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:06.370
So now, let's just simulate A
star and see what happens.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.170
So first of all, you start with
S, and that can either go

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:20.130
to A or B. The actual distance
is 1 plus an estimate on the

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.570
remaining distance.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.410
That gives us 100 plus 100.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:28.860
That's equal to 101.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.160
If we go to B instead, the
actual distance is 1 plus the

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.190
heuristic's distance is 0,
so that's equal to 1.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.870
OK, good.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.140
So now we know that we
always extend the

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.020
shortest path so far.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.020
Did I goof this, or are
you asking a question?

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:49.145 --> 00:41:51.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, when I say
actual, it's the actual

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:52.895
distance that you've traveled.

00:41:52.895 --> 00:41:55.650
AUDIENCE: But that's
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.250
PROFESSOR: So wait a second.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.123
If I go from S to A,
the actual distance

00:42:00.123 --> 00:42:01.338
I've traveled is 1.

00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:03.282
AUDIENCE: I meant like,
does the map--

00:42:03.282 --> 00:42:06.780
PROFESSOR: So now I'm taking
the sum of the actual

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.735
distance, plus the estimated
distance to go.

00:42:08.735 --> 00:42:09.474
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:42:09.474 --> 00:42:10.896
I'm just wondering if the
original map has to be

00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.792
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.792 --> 00:42:17.270
PROFESSOR: See this
is not a map.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:21.630
She was asking if the map has to
be geometrically accurate.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.480
See, this could be a model of
something that's not a map.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.230
And so, I'm free to put any
numbers on those links that I

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.520
want, including estimates, as
long as they're underestimates

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.250
of the distance along
the lengths.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:38.150
So this tells me that my
estimated distance

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.810
here, so far, is 1.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:45.530
So I'll, surely, go down here
to C. And if I go to C, then

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.890
my accumulated distance is 11.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.190
And my estimate of the remaining
distance is 0.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.505
So that's a total of 11.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.270
So now I'm following my
heuristic again and saying

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:07.130
what's the shortest path on
a base of the accumulated

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.180
distance plus the estimated
distance?

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.080
Here, the accumulated
distance plus the

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.490
estimated distance is 101.

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:15.600
Here, it's only 11.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.420
So plainly, I extend this guy.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.300
And that gets me to the goal.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:27.980
And the total accumulated
distance is now 111 plus 0

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.230
equals 111.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.750
And that's not the shortest
path, but wait.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.780
I still have to do my
checking, right?

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.900
I have to extend A. I when I
extend A, I get to B. And now,

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.710
when I get to B that
way, my accumulated

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.230
distance is 2 plus my--

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:53.920
oh, sorry.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.640
S, A, C.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.170
My accumulate distance it 2.

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.910
My estimated distance is 0,
so that's equal to 2.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.150
So I'm OK because I'm still
going to extend

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.810
to this guy, right?

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.950
Wrong.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.210
I've already extended
that guy.

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.530
So I'm hosed.

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.640
I won't find the shortest
path because I'm

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.740
going to stop there.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.085
And I'm going to stop there
because this is an admissible

00:44:20.085 --> 00:44:24.450
heuristic and that's not good
enough unless it's a map.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.620
It's not good enough for this
particular case because this

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:27.210
is not geometric.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.900
This cannot be done as
a map on a plane.

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.850
So that's a situation where what
I've talked to you about,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.730
so far, works with
branch-and-bound.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.070
Works with branch-and -bound
plus an extended list.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.210
But doesn't work when we added
an admissible heuristic.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:48.020
So if we're going to do this in
general, we need something

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.480
stronger than admissibility,
which works only on maps.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:54.590
And so the flourish that I'll
tell you about here in the

00:44:54.590 --> 00:45:10.780
last few seconds of today's
lecture is to add a refinement

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.960
as follows.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.590
So far, we've got
admissibility.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:22.410
And if we want to write this
down in a kind of mathematical

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.680
notation, we could say that
it's admissible if the

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.500
estimated distance between any
node X and the goal is less

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.440
than or equal to the
actual distance

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.490
between X and the goal.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.230
That's the definition
of admissible.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.350
As long as heuristic does
that it's admissible.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.250
And A star works
if it's a map.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.860
But for that kind of situation
where it's not a map we need a

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.445
stronger condition, which
is called consistency.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:59.100
And what that says is that the
distance between X and the

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:04.940
goal minus the distance between
some other node in the

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:11.010
goal, Y. Take the absolute
value of that.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.950
That has to be less than or
equal to the actual distance

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:18.700
between X and Y.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:24.280
So this heuristic satisfy the
consistency condition?

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.600
Well, let's see.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.980
Here the guess is 100.

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:28.660
Here it's 0.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.590
So the absolute difference
is 100.

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.440
But the actual distance
is only 2.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.170
So it satisfies admissibility,
but it doesn't satisfy

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.495
consistency.

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:40.320
And it doesn't work.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.880
So you can almost be guaranteed
we'll give you a

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:47.830
situation where if you
use an admissible

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.490
heuristic you'll lose.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:54.290
And if you use a consistent
heuristic, you'll still win.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.570
So how can we bring this
back into the fold?

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:01.950
Well, we can't use
that heuristic.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:03.480
It's no good.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:09.690
But if this heuristic estimate
of the goal were 2, then we'd

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:15.100
be OK because then it would
still be admissible.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.310
But it would also
be consistent.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.565
So the bottom line is that you
now know something you didn't

00:47:20.565 --> 00:47:24.000
know when you started out
two lectures ago.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.450
You now know how MapQuest and
all of its' descendents work.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:30.470
Now you can find an optimal
path, as well as a

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.390
heuristically good path.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.795
You see that if you don't do
anything other than branch and

00:47:34.795 --> 00:47:37.510
bound it can be extremely
expensive.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.760
And you can even invent
pathological cases where it's

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.890
exponential and the distance
to the goal.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:48.730
So because it can be so
computationally horrible, you

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.360
want to use every advantage
you can, which, generally,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.470
involves using an
extended list.

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:55.790
As well as--

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:56.870
no laptops, please.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:57.510
It still holds.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.930
No smoking, no drinking,
and no laptops.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.200
So you're going to use all
the muscles you can.

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:11.180
And those muscles include using
an extended list and an

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.410
admissible or consistent
heuristic, depending on the

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.350
circumstances.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.880
And so, I think we'll conclude
there since our time is up.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.590
And Elliot, you can ask a
question after class.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:22.990
Why don't you come up
and ask it now?
