00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.360
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.310
"Thus Spake Zarathustra"
was made famous

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.300
and popular by 2001.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.840
And that is music played at this
magic moment when some

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.220
primate suddenly gets an idea,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.690
presumably one of our ancestors.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.210
So how do we explain all that?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.850
We've got all of the ingredients
on the table.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.380
And today I want to talk about
various ways of putting those

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200
ingredients together.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.540
So we talked about
representations, we've talked

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.860
about methods, and today we're
going to talk about

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.340
architectures.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.410
And by the end of the class
you'll know how to put one of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.270
those things together.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.100
Actually, no one knows
how to put one of

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
those things together.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.750
But what you will know is about
some alternatives for

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.992
putting those things together
so as to make something that

00:01:01.992 --> 00:01:08.920
is arguably intelligent in
the same way we are.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.360
So that is our agenda
for today.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.915
We'll also talk a little
bit more about stories.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:26.270
I think it was in 2007 when
the Estonians moved a war

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.990
memorial from the center
of Tallinn off to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.150
a Russian war cemetery.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.690
Prior to that time the Estonians
had been building up

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.870
their national computer networks
because they thought

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.346
that computation was the wave
of the future-- networks and

00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:41.870
all of that.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.920
Shortly after the movement of
that war memorial, someone

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.605
brought the Estonian national
network down--

00:01:49.605 --> 00:01:51.700
a cyber attack.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.930
It was widely believed
to be the Russians.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.330
There's a large Russian
ethnic population in

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.540
Estonia to start with.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.080
And the movement of
that war memorial

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.730
irritated the Russians.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.960
And so everybody everybody
thinks that they did it.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.910
But you know what?

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.110
No computer can understand
the story I just told.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.610
They can revel through all of
the worldwide web finding

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.830
information that's relevant to
that, but no computer can

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.710
understand the story I just
told, except one.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.300
You'll see a demonstration
of that later on today.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.620
So by the way, if you're
interested in understanding

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.480
the nature of intelligence, this
is, of course, the most

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.020
important lecture
of the semester.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.530
And I should tell you a little
bit about what we're going to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.390
do on Wednesday.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.470
Because for some reason the day
before Thanksgiving tends

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.510
to be a lecture that's
lightly populated,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.980
except in this class.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.820
Because I'm going to talk
about the artificial

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.340
intelligence business and what
can be learned from it about

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.580
how to avoid going broke when
you start your company.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.760
So for many of you that will be
the most important lecture

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.680
of the semester.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.070
It all started back in the
dawn age of artificial

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.810
intelligence.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.020
And really, it all started at
Carnegie Mellon, sad to say.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.950
Because the people at Carnegie
Mellon, notably Newell and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.790
Simon, were the first to think
about sort of a general

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.970
purpose way of putting things
together so as to build a

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.530
structure or architecture in
which particular intelligent

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.400
systems could be built.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.260
So their idea was called the
general problem solver.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.680
A long name for a simple idea.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.890
And the simple idea is that you
start your life out in a

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.640
current state, call it C.
And you want to get

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.710
to some goal state.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.940
Call it S. And a way you do that
is you measure somehow

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.810
the symbolic difference between
where you are and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.610
where you want to be.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.085
So that's the difference.

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:14.370
We'll call that difference D.
And when you observe that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.200
difference that's enough, they
say, in this general approach

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.339
to problem solving.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.970
For you to select some operation
that will move you

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.880
from your current state
to some new state, an

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880
intermediate state.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.500
Call it I. So I, or that
operator, O, is determined by

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.660
the difference, D.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.520
And then, of course, the next
thing to do is to measure the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.350
difference between that
intermediate state and the

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.300
state you want to be in, and
choose some operator that's

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.440
relevant to reducing
that state.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.490
So we'll call that D2, and
we'll call this O2.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.950
And D2 is what leads you
to 02, and so it goes.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.550
So that's the idea.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.470
And that's often called
means-ends analysis.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.620
Why?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.620
Because the end that you want
to achieve is being in that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.430
final state, S. And the means
is that operator, O. So you

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.450
have some notion of where you
want to be and the difference

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.060
of where you are and where
you want to be.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.570
And you pick an operator so as
to reduce that difference.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.700
So this is all very abstract.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.020
Let's exercise it in solving a
problem that you will all be

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.930
faced with here in
a day or two.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.910
That is, for many of you--

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.210
most Of you, I hope-- the
problem of going home.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.050
So here you are.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.450
You're at MIT.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.205
And where you want to be
is over here, at home.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.180
So you measure the difference
between MIT and home.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.990
And for many of you it's further
than you can go by car

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.070
and not so far that you
can't go at all.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.180
So what you do is, you say,
well, the right operator is

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.620
taking an airplane.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.125
So there is the operator,
take an airplane.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.600
And this is the difference, D.
And the difference, D, being

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.630
sufficiently large, you
take the plane.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.260
Trouble is, if you happen
to be sitting here in

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.420
[? 10-250 ?]

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.490
there's no way you can take an
airplane, because they don't

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.460
fit in here.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.040
So you've got another
problem, and that is

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.330
to get to the airplane.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.560
So the distance between here
and Logan is such that the

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.045
right way to do that is
to take the MBTA.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.310
And that's determined because
you're working on this

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.840
difference reduction right
here, the difference from

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.070
being at MIT and being
at the airport.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.610
So that difference dictates
that you take the MBTA.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.910
So you see, you're re-cursing.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.860
But you know there are no MBTA
cars in here either.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.210
So there's still a difference
like so.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.310
And that difference dictates
that you walk.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.670
So you've got D1, D2, and D3.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.140
And by the time you've excised
the operators relevant to

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.690
those three differences,
you're at Logan.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.705
Then you take the airplane, you
get over to your hometown,

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.960
and your faced with the smaller
difference of getting

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.660
from that airport to where
you actually want to go.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.150
So that's the general problem-
solver idea.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.440
It was such an exciting
idea at the time.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.850
It was such an exciting idea
at the time because people

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.380
would say to themselves, ah!

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.570
This is a general purpose
problem solver, so we can set

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.740
it onto the problem of making
itself smarter.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.460
And so there was a kind of
imagined chain reaction that

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.080
would take place.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.660
And the developers of this
architecture warned the public

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.190
that within 10 years-- that
is to say, by about 1970--

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.760
computers would be generally
as smart as people.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.870
And a lot of people made fun of
them for that prediction.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.300
But it was actually scientists
attempting to be responsible.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.750
Because they thought something,
a quite serious

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.220
dislocation was coming along,
and that people should know

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.400
that it was coming.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.030
And so they felt it was their
responsibility in that age of

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.810
scientific responsibility
to warn the public.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.770
It didn't turn out that way,
because the problem of

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.049
collecting the differences and
finding the operators, that's

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.340
outside the scope of
the architecture.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.500
So this is the problem that has
to be solved by a human

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.570
before this architecture
can be used.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.370
You have to have identified the
differences that you might

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:51.490
encounter and the operators that
you might use, and build

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.740
this table which relates
the two together.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.150
So maybe that one, that
one, some off-diagonal

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.490
elements, and so on.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.600
But building that table turned
out to be a hard job.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.210
So not surprisingly,
the idea evolved.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.940
And eventually the folks at
Carnegie who developed the

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.790
general problem solver--

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.170
most notably Newell
and his students--

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.800
developed a newer, fresher, more
elaborate architecture

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.050
called SOAR.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.760
And here's how SOAR works.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.050
First of all, what
does SOAR mean?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.090
It doesn't mean anything.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:45.750
It used to mean State
Operator And Result.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.360
But for some reason the
proponents of the SOAR

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.450
architecture decided they don't
like that acronym, and

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.540
have asserted that SOAR is
merely a label that shouldn't

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.010
be thought of as an acronym.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.940
In any event, SOAR consists
of various parts.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.750
It has a long-term memory.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.790
It has a short-term memory.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.030
And it has connections to the
outside world, maybe a vision

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.950
system and an action system.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.380
But most of the activity of
the SOAR problem-solving

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.750
architecture takes place
in a short-term memory.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.300
So you can view the contents
of the long-term memory as

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.000
shuttling in and out of
short-term memory.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.950
So you can see right away that
this mechanism, this

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.800
architecture, is heavily
influenced by certain

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.060
cognitive psychology experiments
having to do with

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.400
how much you can hold in your
short-term memory--

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.530
nonsense syllables and all that
sort of thing that was

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.570
popular back in those days.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.530
So this was an architecture
devised primarily by

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.380
psychologists.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.170
And it had amongst its features
a short-term memory

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.420
and a long-term memory.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.580
So that's part 1 of
this architecture.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.770
So what's in the long-term
memory?

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:25.890
Well, assertions and rules,
AKA productions.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.390
A production being the Carnegie
vernacular for rule.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.060
It's just the rule-based stuff
like you saw on almost the

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.930
first day of class.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.650
So the whole thing is a gigantic
rule-based system

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:48.230
with assertions and rules the
shuttle back and forth from

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.160
long-term memory into short-term
memory where

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.740
processing takes place.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:55.350
The third thing that comes to
mind when you think of SOAR

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.710
architecture is they had an
elaborate preference system.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.610
You recall that when we talked
about rule-based systems

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.560
there's always a question of
what do you do when more than

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.300
one rule would work?

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.300
You have to have some way
of breaking those ties.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.430
The SOAR architecture
has an elaborate

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.770
subsystem for doing that.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.580
But I said that these are the
first three things you think,

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.760
and maybe that's not right.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.050
Because the next thing you
think about is perhaps a

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.890
better thing to identify with
the SOAR architecture.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.435
And that's the idea
of problem spaces.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.160
And that's the idea that if
you're going to solve a

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.220
problem you have to develop a
space and do a search through

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.760
that space.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.280
Just like we did when we talked
about how we can get

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.580
from here to home.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.310
There's a space of places,
that's our problem space.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.430
We can do a search through that
space to find a way to

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.400
get from one place to another.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.540
That's the sort of thing that
SOAR is focused on.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.520
Finally, the fifth element that
you tend to think about

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.150
when you think about SOAR
is the idea of universal

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.400
subgoaling.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.540
And that's the idea that
whenever you can't think of

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.420
want to do next, that becomes
your next problem that

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.590
deserves it's own problem
space and its own set of

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.210
differences and operators,
and rules and assertions.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.970
So you start off on a high
level, then you have to solve

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.560
problems at a lower level, just
like you did up there

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.430
with a general problem solver.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.090
So if you have these two
architectures you can begin to

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.280
say, well, what are
they centered on?

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.860
And this architecture, this
general problem solver, is

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:55.970
centered on the idea
that everything is

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:00.150
about problem solving.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.505
Because the problem solving
hypothesis--

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.020
no one gave it that name.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.680
But that's what it was.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.770
And this architecture
did get its name.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:20.860
And it was said always, by
Newell, to be based on what he

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.875
called the symbol system
hypothesis.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.760
The hypothesis that what we
are as humans is symbol

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.100
manipulators.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:43.980
And we can uncover how that
all works by giving people

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.960
crypto-arithmetic problems and
having them talk out loud, by

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.850
thinking about what happens
when you try to remember

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.280
nonsense syllables, by all that
sort of stuff that was en

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.120
vogue in terms of psychology
experiments in the day when

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.110
this architecture was
first articulated.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:01.700
But when you look at
architectures you can sort of

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.472
see where they come from and
what their antecedents are.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:12.290
It has a short-term memory and
a long-term memory, because

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.730
Newell and his associates were
cognitive scientists.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:21.140
It has assertions and rules
and preferences, because

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.170
Newell and his associates
were also AI people.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:29.950
And it has problem spaces and
universal subgoaling because

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.520
those are ideas that had been
work out in a more primitive

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.370
form already in the general
problem-solver architecture.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.740
So that's a glimpse of
what SOAR looked like

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.750
in its early days.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.350
It's been very highly
developed by a

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.280
lot of smart people.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.420
So although it's symbol
centered, they've attached to

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.710
it things having to do with
emotion and perception, but

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.290
generally with the view that
the first thing to do when

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.020
faced with this perception is to
get it out of there and get

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.830
it into a symbolic form.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:05.180
That's sort of the bias that the
architecture comes with.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.770
So those are two architectures
that are heavily biased toward

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.570
thinking that the important
part of what we

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.600
do is problem solving.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.020
But the most important,
perhaps--

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.820
at least from an MIT
perspective--

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.770
of these problem-solving
oriented ways of thinking

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:26.150
about the world, is Marvin
Minsky's architecture, which

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:36.860
he articulates in his book
"The Emotion Machine."

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.820
And Marvin is not just concerned
with problem

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.080
solving, but also with
how problem solving

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.620
might come in layers.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.960
So let me show you an example
of the sort of problem what

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.570
motivates some of Marvin's
thinking.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:08.600
So you can read that, it's
a short little vignette.

00:17:14.387 --> 00:17:17.708
You have no trouble
understanding it, right?

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:19.099
No.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.960
It's not difficult
for us humans.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.950
Awfully tough for a computer.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.760
In part, because the thinking
you need, your ability to

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.210
understand that story, requires
you to think on many

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.110
levels at the same time.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.030
First of all, there's
a sort of, at the

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.490
bottom, instinctive reaction.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.650
You see where there's
instinctive reaction?

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.000
That's the part where
she hears a sound

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.850
and terns her head.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:54.400
That's instinct, right?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.190
That's practically built in.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.030
But then what she
sees is a car.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.310
So that's something that
we don't have wired in.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.700
It would be unlikely that we've
evolved in the last 100

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.500
years to have an instinctive
appreciation of cars

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.980
barrelling down the road.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.120
So the next level in Marvin's

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.365
architecture is learned reaction.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.530
So that's the part about
thinking about the car.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.320
Now spread throughout there--
well, let's see where is a

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.640
particularly good example.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.750
She decides to sprint
across the road.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.380
So that's where she's
solving a problem.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.610
So that's the deliberative
thinking level.

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:55.630
It doesn't stop there, because
later on she reflects on her

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.670
impulsive decision.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.950
So she thinks not only about
stuff that's happening out

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.020
there in the world, but she also
thinks about stuff that's

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.970
going on in here.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.580
So that's a level which we can
call reflective thinking.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.630
Well, you know, it doesn't stop
there, because she also

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.690
considers, in another part of
the story, something about

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.690
being uneasy about
arriving late.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.790
So she's not only just thinking
about events that are

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.890
going on in her mind right now,
but events that are going

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.610
on right now relative
to plans she's made.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.660
Some Marvin calls that the
self-reflecting layer.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.280
But that isn't the whole thing
either, because toward the end

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.560
of the story she starts to worry
about what her friends

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.970
would think of her.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.580
So there's a kind of reflective
thinking in a more

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.410
social context.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.590
So he calls that self-conscious
thinking.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.270
So as the Carnegie folks think,
the SOAR architecture

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:19.830
focuses mostly on problem
solving, Minsky's "Emotion

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:25.980
Machine" book considers not just
thinking, but thinking on

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.700
many layers.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.740
And the blocker to doing any of
that can be said to be the

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.700
development of common sense,
which computers, alas, have

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.430
never had much of.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:47.170
So this could be said to be
based on the common sense

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.420
hypothesis.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.530
And the common sense hypothesis
holds that in order

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.590
to do all of that stuff,
you have to have

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.650
common sense like people.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.420
And if you have to have common
sense like people, you have to

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.700
think about how much of
that is there and how

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.460
can we go get it?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:13.390
And so this spawned a lot of
activity in the media lab

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.680
amongst people influenced by
Marvin, having to do with

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.340
gathering common sense.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.420
The open mind project, the work
of Henry Lieberman and

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.260
others, having to do with the
gathering of common sense from

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.330
the world wide web as a way of
populating systems that would

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.470
lay the foundation for doing
this kind of layered thinking.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:43.290
So that is a brief survey of
some mechanisms, some older

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.210
than others, but all but GPS--

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.070
GPS too.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.630
Let's face it, it's hard to
think of solving any problem

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.020
without means-ends analysis
being involved.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:57.380
So GPS isn't wrong, it's just
not the only tool you need to

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.430
think about what to do.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.950
So these are early, and late,
and still-current.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.260
But it's not the only thing
there is, because there have

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.850
been reactions against this
problem-solving way of

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.740
thinking about the development
of intelligence.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.120
And the most prominent of those
counter currents, of

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.900
those alternative ideas, belongs
to Rod Brooks and his

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.130
subsumption architecture.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.950
So along about the early--

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:30.100
along about the years
surrounding 1990, Brooks

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.350
became upset--

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.000
subsumption--

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.610
because robots couldn't
do much.

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.980
They would turn them on at
night, and then the next

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.750
morning they'd come in the
laboratory and they would have

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.820
moved 25 feet, nicely avoiding
a table perhaps.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.500
Not doing very much and taking
a long time to do it.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.070
So he had decided that it's
because people were thinking

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.590
in the wrong way.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.770
In those days people thought
that the way you build a robot

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.970
is you build a vision system,
and then you build a reasoning

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.340
system, and then you build
an action system.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.830
And it can do almost nothing,
but it does something.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.980
So you improve the vision
system, and improve the

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.530
reasoning system, and improve
the actual system.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.090
And now you've broken it,
because all the stuff you used

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.000
to be able to do doesn't
work anymore.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.490
So what's the alternative?

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.320
Well, the alternative, as
articulated by Brooks, is to

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.900
turn this idea on its side.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.570
So instead of having an
encapsulated vision system, an

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.960
encapsulated reasoning system,
and an encapsulated action

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.390
system, what you have is layers
that are focused not on

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.820
the sensing and the reasoning
and the action, but layers

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:55.260
that are specialized to dealing
with the world.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.000
So in Brook's way of thinking
about things, at the lowest

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.880
level you might have a system
that's capable of--

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.580
well, before we get to that,
avoiding objects.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.820
And maybe the next level up
is the wandering layer.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.835
And maybe the next level up
after that is explore.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.140
And maybe the next level
up after that is seek.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.550
Now in the old days when people
took 6001 I had no

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.930
trouble getting an answer the
question, what does this

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.940
remind you of in 6001?

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.530
It doesn't remind you of
anything in 6001 since you

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.740
haven't taken it.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.780
But it viewed, as a
generalization of a

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.620
programming idea, what is
the programming idea?

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:45.740
There are only a few powerful
ideas in program, and this is

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.180
a generalization
of one of them.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.070
What is it?

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.400
Do you have a name?

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.412
Yes, Andrew?

00:24:51.412 --> 00:24:52.620
STUDENT: Layers of
abstraction?

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.210
PROFESSOR: Layers
of abstraction,

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.760
and abstraction barriers.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.500
That nails it pretty well.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.690
Because each of these guys can
have its own vision, action,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.940
and reasoning system.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.870
And if you think of these as
abstraction boundaries, then

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.035
when you got this thing working
you don't screw with

00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:16.460
it anymore.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.020
You build this layer on top.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.240
And it may reach down in here
from time to time, but it

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.990
doesn't fundamentally
change it.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.790
Brooks was inspired in part
by the way our brains are

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.980
constructed.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.340
All that old stuff that we share
with pigs is down in

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:32.090
there deep, and we put the
neocortex over it.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.660
So it looks layered in
a way that would make

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.960
[? Gerry Sussman ?] proud.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:42.610
So this then is the way that
Brooks looks at the world, and

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.310
it's characterized by a few
features just like SOAR is.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.040
One of those features is
no representation.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.920
So this is a detail that's
probably right at the level

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.620
that Brooks was operating, and
very questionable when you get

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.310
above the level that Brooks
was operating.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:15.810
But before I go on, let me say
what the hypothesis is.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.695
The hypothesis is the
creature hypothesis.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:30.320
It's the hypothesis that once
you can get a machine to act

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.190
as smart as an insect, then
the rest will be easy.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.930
Well, how do you get
a creature to

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:38.200
be smart as an insect?

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.760
Maybe you don't need
representation.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.330
We focused on representation in
this course, so you can see

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.580
there's a little stress---

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.210
Next thing is, what do you
do if you don't have a

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.490
representation?

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.110
Let's see.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.430
Your representation makes
a model possible.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:02.250
Models make it possible to
predict, to understand, to

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.780
explain, and to control.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.630
So if you don't have one what
can you possibly do?

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:14.470
Brooks' answer is, you use the
world instead of a model.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.790
So everything you
do is reactive.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.210
You don't have anything
in your head that is

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.990
a map of this room.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.930
But maybe I don't need one
because I can get around that

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.720
table by constantly
observing it.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.200
And we don't have to fill
up the memory with that

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.710
information, I can
just react to it.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.010
So no representation, use the
world instead of a model, and

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:50.630
the mechanisms in their
purest form are just

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:51.880
finite-state machines.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.940
So with that, Brooks was able to
do things that people were

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.350
never able to do before.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.330
And what's the modern
[? instantiation ?]

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.390
of this architecture?

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.010
Now, according to Brooks, in use
in 5 million homes in the

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:15.260
United States?

00:28:18.009 --> 00:28:18.950
STUDENT: The Roomba?

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:23.900
PROFESSOR: It's the Roomba The
Roomba robot is, by Brooks'

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.850
account, approximately
the thirteenth

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.960
business plan of iRobot.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.740
And it's the one that made it
big, because the Rumba vacuum

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.610
cleaner has been very
successful.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.215
Would you like to see a movie
of its processor?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.520
So this is a film made some time
ago that shows, in some

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.370
sense, the summa of
that architecture.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.300
What I want you to imagine very
briefly is a robot that

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.600
wanders around in the halls
and rooms of the old

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.290
[? Tech Square ?]

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:01.440
clinking the Coke cans.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.920
Okay, you all got an image
of that in your mind?

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.260
Because I want you to compare
the image you now have of that

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.550
robot that's wandering around
collecting the Coke can, with

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:11.800
the actual movie.

00:29:21.693 --> 00:29:22.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.520
-Herbert, the soda-can
collecting mobile robot.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.360
He was built at the MIT
AI lab in 1989.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.606
Work was done by John Cannell
under the supervision of

00:29:32.606 --> 00:29:34.820
Rodney Brooks.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:38.800
Herbert is a robot controlled
by subsumption architecture.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.700
This is a collection of small
behaviors that influence the

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.920
overall activities
of the robot.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.310
There are no centralized
controllers

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.380
and no world model.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.890
-Herbert navigates by using a
number of infrared proximity

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.610
censors around its body
and basically

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.350
following walls and corridors.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.710
It can also look for the can
through a laser light striper.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.370
Right now it's come out of the
door of an office, followed

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:12.350
along the wall, and then its
laser light striper has seen a

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:15.400
can on top of the desk
in front of it.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.060
When this happens the robots
and deploys its arm.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.560
You can see the arm
going out now.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.470
-The arm has a number
of censors itself.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.130
There are fingertip censors, a
break beam in the jaws, and

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.340
two infrared proximity sensors
on the front of the hand.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.960
-It grabs cans in a stereotype
fashion.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.720
First, it lowers down to find
a surface somewhere, then it

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.630
bounces along the
surface until it

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.630
sees the can in front.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.495
It uses the hand-based IRs to
re-center the arm by rotating

00:30:48.495 --> 00:30:52.380
the robot's body until the can
comes between the jaws of the

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.960
gripper, at which point the
break-beam senses the can.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.050
-After acquiring the can,
Herbert will have tucked the

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:03.371
arm back into its normal
traveling configuration and

00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:04.621
attempt to go home.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.560
-Since it has no central
[? arm presentation, ?] it

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.400
doesn't have any map of
where it came from.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.550
Instead, it has an algorithm
which uses a magnetic compass

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.000
to determine every time it comes
through a door, will it

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.290
be able to find the door?

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.770
It basically has a policy of
always going north every time

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:33.220
it exits the door.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.280
-So now the can is being
tucked away.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.040
As the robot turns you'll see
a red stripe from the laser

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.290
range finder.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.410
And now it's using
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.530
IR to navigate back, find the
door, and go through the door

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:52.780
with its prize.

00:32:07.616 --> 00:32:08.120
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.700
PROFESSOR: And there, if you
were paying attention, you saw

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.840
a little glimpse of John Cannell
who was the student to

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.700
develop that system.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.950
So that was a tour de force.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:18.070
That was a magic moment.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.970
That was when you open
the champagne.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.430
It's not what you expected, of
course, because when I say

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.280
imagine a robot wandering around
in [? Tech Square ?]

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.160
picking up Coke cans, that
leaves open a huge envelope of

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.120
possible hallucinations.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.930
And usually or hallucinations
about these things are--

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:38.590
we imagine things to be more
fluid, more natural, and more

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.780
impressive than they
actually are.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.680
But that was impressive, because
no robot came close to

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.655
doing anything like
that before.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.740
More to be said about
that during the

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:53.060
business lecture on Wednesday.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.810
So that's the subsumption
architecture.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:06.230
By the way, maybe at this point
we can say something

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.020
about how the other
architectures relate to what

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.460
Minsky was talking about.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:18.270
What's this deliberative
thinking layer correspond to?

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:24.370
That's what SOAR is about,
and maybe GPS.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.200
So what's subsumption about?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.860
It's about stuff down here.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.685
It's about instinctive reaction
and learned reaction.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.120
But shoot, what about Minsky's
other layers?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.180
If we're going to be building
systems that are as smart as

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.390
those things then we have to
worry a little bit about that

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:05.710
sort of thing too.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.080
So that brings us to the
genesis architecture.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.679
And now let me give you the
standard caution that should

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.500
be early in the presentation
of any academic.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.940
I will sometimes say "I," and
what I mean is "we." And

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.540
sometimes I'll say "we," and
what I mean is "they." This

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.739
was a system that was developed
mostly by students

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.280
of mine who persuaded me, after
a great deal of time,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.420
that they were thinking the
right kinds of thoughts.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.469
But here's how the genesis
architecture works.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:43.940
As no surprise, given recent
discussions, it's all centered

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.190
on language.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:54.880
And the language part of the
genesis system has two roles,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:59.910
one of which is to guide, and
marshal, and interact with the

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:01.160
perceptual systems.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:14.645
And the other is to enable the
description of events.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:37.610
That's how it works.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:41.372
So is perception important?

00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:43.290
I don't know.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:47.130
I might ask you a question like,
is there anybody sitting

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.440
in the front row wearing
blue jeans?

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.410
And it's hard for you to
resist, under those

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.370
circumstances, your eyes from
going over there and answering

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.350
the question.

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:58.180
Your eyes answer the question.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:02.780
No symbol processing system is
involved, except in so far as

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.600
my language system has
communicated with their

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.540
language system, which drives
your motor system and your

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.690
vision system to go over
there and answer the

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.490
question for you.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.980
But it's not just the real stuff
that the language system

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.040
directs your attention to.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.970
It's also the imagined stuff.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.160
It's been a long semester.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.010
Have I told you the story
about my table saw?

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.580
Probably not.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.120
Here's the deal.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.630
I bought a table saw.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.560
It's a wonderful table saw.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.940
I was installing it with
a friend of mine

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.190
who's a cabinet maker.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.910
He said, never wear gloves
when you operate the saw.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.950
"Why?" I said.

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.900
Before he could answer the
question I figured it out.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.540
Can you figure out why you never
wear gloves when you

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.450
operate a table saw?

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:46.930
You know what a table
saw is, right?

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:48.650
It's a table with a spinning
blade in the middle.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.640
And you use it to cut wood.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.095
Why should you never
wear gloves?

00:36:55.095 --> 00:36:55.582
Yes?

00:36:55.582 --> 00:36:56.560
STUDENT: Well--

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:57.770
STUDENT: --Well, you
know the answer.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.170
Ha, that's not fair.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.230
That's old Brett up there.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:03.180
He's heard the story
too many times.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.042
Yes, Andrew, you got it.

00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:06.810
STUDENT: I've been told
the answer before.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:07.960
PROFESSOR: You've been
told the answer.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.740
How about somebody who hasn't
been told the answer.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.130
Yes?

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.920
STUDENT: Because the gloves
might get caught.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.410
PROFESSOR: Because the glove
might get caught and pull your

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:15.670
hand into the blade.

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.920
And then what happens?

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.740
It's horrible.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.360
You're hand gets mangled and
your fingers get cut off, and

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.300
this happens a lot
to professionals.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.790
It won't actually happen with
that table saw that I bought,

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:33.130
because its play detects flesh
and stops the blade, which

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.250
then leads to stopping the blade
and having the blade

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.140
retreat into the table in
about two microseconds--

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:39.590
two milliseconds.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.460
So, in general though, it's a
bad idea, and you always have

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.490
to suppose that the mechanism
isn't working anyway in order

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:48.320
to use good safety practice.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.170
But here's an example of
something that nobody ever

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:53.560
told you that he was able to
figure out, by imagining what

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.815
would happen and reading the
answers off of the scene that

00:37:56.815 --> 00:37:58.420
he imagined.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:02.260
So nobody ever says many of the
things that we know, but

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.000
we know them anyway.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.330
Here's another example.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:05.650
Imagine running down
the street with a

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.550
full bucket of water.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.190
What happens?

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:12.110
The water splashes out and
gets your leg wet, right?

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.500
You won't find that in
Open Minds database.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.630
Nobody ever said that
over the web.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:17.620
It's not written
down anywhere.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:19.040
But you know it.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.710
Because you, we human beings
have the capacity to imagine

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.090
perceptual things and read the
answers to questions off of

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.940
our imaginations with that
perceptual apparatus.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:35.020
So that's a very important
connection down there.

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.150
And then if you've got the
ability to describe events,

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.930
then you've got the ability to
tell and understand stories.

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:48.030
And if you can do that, then you
can start to get a handle

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:56.160
on culture, both macro
and micro.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:04.500
And by macro culture I mean the
country you grew up in,

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.320
the religion you grew up with.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.290
And by micro I mean your
family and personal

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.680
experience, and all
shades in between.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.520
So I don't know, what inspires
me and my associates to think

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.250
in these terms?

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.800
We talked about a little bit of
it last time when I talked

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.060
about evolution and the apparent
flowering of our

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:30.140
species about 50,000
years ago, at

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.300
which time we got something.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.940
And I believe that
what we got--

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.260
and this is the characterization
of this

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.540
particular hypothesis--

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:45.130
what we got is the ability
to tell stories

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.980
and understand them.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:52.540
So if we want to label this
representation, it's the label

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.840
strong story hypothesis.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.530
So what's the weak
story hypothesis?

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.540
The weak story hypothesis
is, this is important.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.260
The strong story hypothesis
is, this is all there is.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.190
But is there any other evidence
of this is really,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:15.670
really, really important?

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.520
So I've queried Krishna here
before the class starts, and

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.560
he tells me I haven't told
you about the following

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.850
experiment.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:28.300
This, in my way of thinking, is
the most important series

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.720
of experiments ever done in
cognitive psychology,

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.550
developmental psychology,
actually.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:39.090
So here's how we get started.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.070
There's a rectangular room,
if you're a person.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.490
If you're a rat, it's
a rectangular box.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.720
All the walls are
painted white.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.610
Are you with me so far?

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:02.360
So now, in each corner there's
a basket, or cloth, or

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:10.320
something in which or under
which you can put some food.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.055
Now, you put the food there
while the rat watches you.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:26.540
And then you give the rat a
little spin to disorient it.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.790
All right?

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:34.130
So then, the rest stops
and goes for the food.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.440
And you can keep track of
where the rat goes.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.070
And the rat goes with
approximate equal probability

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:44.760
predominantly to those
two corners.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.096
So I'd have bet you
didn't know that

00:41:46.096 --> 00:41:48.040
rats were that smart.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.070
So they understand the
rectangular nature of the room

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.880
and they don't go to the
diagonal corners where the

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.090
food cannot be.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.390
So are these genius rats?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.050
Or maybe we're just rats
with big brains.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.550
Because we do the same thing.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:08.220
So if you repeat this experiment
and replace the rat

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:14.470
with a small child, and then you
put a toy in there instead

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.520
of food, and the rat--

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.550
not the rat.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:24.600
The child is usually held in a
parent's arms, usually the

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.780
child's mother--

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.840
usually because they think that
if they participate in

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.320
these experiments up there at
Harvard their kid will get

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.290
into Harvard some day.

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.015
So the kid goes to a diagonal
corner just like a rat.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:46.790
And then the next thing you do
is, you try an adult, maybe an

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.890
MIT student.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:50.680
That way you can
use food again.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.330
And you get the same result.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.680
Who could be surprised?

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.570
So rats, children, and human
adults, pretty much all the

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:11.450
same with respect to this
experiment, until you paint

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.440
one wall blue.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.370
Rats are not colorblind, in
case you're wondering.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.130
Then what happens?

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:25.930
Well, if you pay one wall blue
the rat still goes with equal

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.560
probability to the two
diagonal corners.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.370
If you paint one wall blue, the
child still goes to the

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:37.230
two diagonal corners with
approximate equal probability.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:42.940
It's only us genius human
adults who go

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.190
only to that corner.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.285
So this invites a couple
of questions.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:57.510
One of which is, when does
a child become an adult?

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.760
Any ideas?

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.185
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:06.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.630
PROFESSOR: You can pick a
number greater than 1

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:14.620
and less than 10.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.024
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

00:44:16.024 --> 00:44:16.860
STUDENT: Five?

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.550
PROFESSOR: It's a pretty
good guess.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.920
Do you have siblings
at that age?

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.980
It's a surprise but,
why is it five?

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.480
Is it because--

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.910
what does it relate to?

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:30.450
Is there any correlate to the
onset of that ability?

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.450
You might try everything, as
[INAUDIBLE] does, because

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.250
she's extremely careful.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:40.340
So she's tried gender, she's
tried the onset of language,

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.430
the appreciation of music,
handedness, and there's only

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.530
one thing that matters.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:51.640
And that is that the child
becomes adult at that time

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.440
when they start to use the word
left and right when they

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.450
describe the world.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.700
Now I said that very carefully
because they understand left

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.050
and right at an earlier age, but
they only have started to

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.530
use the words left and right
when they describe the world

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:10.900
at the time that they begin to
break this symmetry and go to

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.560
the correct corner.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.140
Now for the next element of this
I need something to read.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.390
Has anyone got a
textbook handy?

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.680
Ah, "China, an Illustrated
History."

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.930
Now I need a volunteer.

00:45:30.875 --> 00:45:31.320
OK.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.440
Andrew, you want to do this?

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.690
So here's what you're
going to do.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.270
You can stay there.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:40.520
But you need to stand up.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.750
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to read you a

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.310
passage from this book.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:45.710
And I want you to say
it back to me at the

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.260
same time I read it.

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.610
It's as if you're doing
simultaneous translation,

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:53.405
except it's English
to English.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.160
This things got words
I can't pronounce.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.080
OK, are you ready to go?

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.220
All right.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.330
"When overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the problems he

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.730
tackled, he began to suspect
that others were plotting

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:14.600
against him or secretly
ridiculing him."

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.420
Thank you very much.

00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:16.560
That's great.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.880
So you see, he could do it.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880
Some people can't do it.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.360
At least it take a
little practice.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.780
But he did it.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.080
And guess what I've
done to him?

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.080
I've reduced his intelligence
to that of a rat.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:36.930
Because if you do this
experiment with an adult human

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.850
who's doing this simultaneous
English to English

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:40.940
translation, they go with equal

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.910
probability to the two corners.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.210
So what's happened?

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.720
What's happened is
you've jambed

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:50.930
their language processor.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.070
And when their language
processor is jambed they can't

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:57.970
put the blue wall together with
the rectangular shape.

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.290
So it seems to be that language
is the mediator of

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.520
exactly the combinators you
need in order to build

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.250
descriptions.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.870
Because they can't even put
those things together when

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.870
their language processor is
jambed by the simultaneous

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:13.670
translation phenomenon.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:17.310
So that brings us to the two
gold star ideas of the day.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:29.730
One is, if you want to make
yourself smarter you want to

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.690
do those things--

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.760
look, listen, draw, and talk.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.100
Because those are the particular
mechanisms that

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.440
surround this area down here,
which is the center of what we

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:43.120
do-- which is the center
of our thinking.

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.140
So why do you take
notes in class?

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.350
Now because you'll ever look at
them before, but because it

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:51.980
forces the engagement
of your linguistic--

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.390
of your linguistic, your motor,

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:54.820
and your visual apparatus.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.520
And that makes you smarter,
because it's

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.520
exercising that stuff.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.560
The second thing you can say, in
conclusion, especially from

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:12.355
this experiment, is beware
of fast talkers.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.260
Why do you want to be aware
of fast talkers.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.430
It's not because they will
talk you into anything.

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.940
It's because that when they talk
fast they're jambing your

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.000
language processor and
you can't thing.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.600
That's why you want to be
aware of fast talkers.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.850
Because if they jamb your
language processor you won't

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:38.200
thinking and you'll buy that
car, or you'll buy that drink,

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.925
or you'll do any manner of
things that people who want

00:48:40.925 --> 00:48:45.272
you to do those things have
learned to do by talking to

00:48:45.272 --> 00:48:47.960
jamb your processor.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.620
So that completes what we're
going to do today.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.290
And I'll give you a
demonstration of some of this

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.540
stuff on another occasion.
