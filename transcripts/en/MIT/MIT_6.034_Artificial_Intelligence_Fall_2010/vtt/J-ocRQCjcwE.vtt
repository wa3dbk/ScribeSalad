00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:25.480
PROFESSOR: Here we have a
near miss learning tree.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.220
It's a little bit different
but a little bit similar.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.440
We've got different types.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.060
We're trying to learn about
different light sources.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.300
So we're concerned about
different lamps, flashlights,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.620
all sorts of things.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.770
So these guys can have had types
of support, a base or wires.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.400
The base can be flat,
clamped, or have legs.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.440
The legs can be flat
bottomed or wheeled.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.030
The light source can be
incandescent, fluorescent,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.270
or sodium vapor.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.780
And the energy
source that powers it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
can be electric,
battery, oil, or gas.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.350
So there's also
some other things.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.840
But these are the trees
that we might be climbing up

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.840
with the climb-tree heuristic.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.050
Our starting model is we
have an incandescent bulb.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.870
The height is equal
to 24 inches exactly.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.840
They have a flat base.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.500
There's electricity to power it.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.350
And it has a shade.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.820
So our starting model is
basically like a table lamp

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.230
that you set on the table.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.890
It's got the shade
over the top of it.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.250
You know, the standard
room table lamp

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.930
is our starting model.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.840
So recall in arch
learning, which

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.030
is what we are using here, that
there are several heuristics

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.110
that we might want to use.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.930
Let's see, well, the
heuristics are-- we've

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.765
got require-link, forbid-link.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:17.600
We've got climb-tree,
extend-set, close-interval.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:34.570
And we also have drop-link--
forgot about that one.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.130
That's sort of with the links.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.880
I can put it here.

00:02:42.802 --> 00:02:47.910
OK, so if you want to do
well on these questions

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.680
if they appear on the
final, first of all,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.070
you better know what
those six heuristics do.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:04.330
So basically require-link
is a heuristic.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.000
It goes into your
model as a requirement,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.450
where before your
model just didn't care.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.240
So let's say there was something
about color for your light,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.970
like for your lamp's
base or for the lamp.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.850
And right, now it doesn't
care about color at all.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.370
But let's say that you wound
up having an example that was,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.130
for instance, blue or white
or whatever these colors are.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:43.610
And it wound up getting that
blue was OK for-- in its model,

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.410
it wound up getting, OK,
blue and white are OK.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.790
Or actually, no, an even
more basic example--

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.590
let's say that it just kept
getting blue lamps as examples,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.760
and all of them were blue.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.218
And it just didn't care about
the fact that they were blue.

00:03:58.218 --> 00:04:00.420
But they did turn
out to be blue.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.060
And then eventually
it found a red one

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.780
that was exactly the
same as its model,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.320
but the red one was a near miss.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.840
Then it might
require blue, which

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.110
was already an acceptable,
permissible thing in its model.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.050
But it could be required.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.899
Now, another thing
it can do is forbid.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.990
Some people ask me, why
would you bother saying,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.500
forbid red, say, if you can
already just require blue?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.940
Together they cover
the same ground.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.110
The answer is because this
system, this arch learning

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.870
system-- remember, it's
Patrick's doctoral thesis.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.560
It's an old system.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.200
Because it was
built on old systems

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.410
and because also it's
generally a good idea,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.902
it was very parsimonious.

00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:49.360
Let's say you had
a set of colors--

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.440
red, blue, yellow, green,
pink, purple, orange--

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.080
and you found that only orange
was giving you problems,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.800
you could try to require
that it be in this.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.810
Or you could even
use extend-set,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.060
make a giant set of red, blue,
yellow, green, purple, pink,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.800
but not orange.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.750
But if you just
forbid orange, you've

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.050
just saved a whole
bunch of space,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.506
particularly if there's a
large possible series of set.

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:23.130
You want to have the
ability to forbid.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.220
Because it needs to have the
smallest model that it can

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.120
that covers all of its samples.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.180
So we also have climb-tree.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.070
Climb-tree takes one of
the elements in our model

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.805
and moves up the tree one level.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.355
So let's say we said, only
incandescent lights are good.

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.480
But we found that fluorescent
lights are also good.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.300
Whoop, we move up to
light source, climb-tree.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.230
Extend-set-- we don't
have any sets here.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.210
But let's go back to red,
blue, orange, yellow.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.670
Extend-set is when we say,
only red is good as an example.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.810
But we see another positive
example that's yellow.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.790
So we say, OK, I'll
extend the set.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.670
Red and yellow are both good.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.100
All right, close-interval--
close-interval

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.990
is really obvious when
you need to use it.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.220
Because not only is it only
used for intervals like height

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.020
equals 24 inches or
some kind of numbers,

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.420
but it is the only thing
you can use for when height

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.840
equals some kind of numbers.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.270
Close-interval will let you
fuss around with the intervals

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.420
and say, oh, well I guess one
with a 20 inch height is OK,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.020
too.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.134
So we'll make the whole
interval 20 to 24 inches good.

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:44.300
Because it doesn't make any
sense for it to be like,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.820
20 is good, 24 is good, but
nothing in between is good.

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.120
No, those are awful.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.930
So that close-interval
covers the entire interval.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.800
Last but not least is drop-link.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.080
The thing about drop-link
is that drop-link is, again,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.790
only really used due to the
fact that the system wants

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.560
to be as parsimonious as
possible with its model.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.880
Drop-link is-- let's say you
have a color, and you're like,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.034
OK, only red is acceptable.

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:14.200
And then you see a blue one.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.700
It's OK.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.074
And let's say red, blue, and
yellow are your only colors.

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:18.690
Only red and blue
are acceptable.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.740
Hey, wait a minute.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.890
No, we can just say
that only yellow

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.350
is not acceptable, or
something like that, all right?

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.090
But then you see yellow
as a positive example.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.236
Actually, you can't even
switch to the yellow being

00:07:32.236 --> 00:07:33.090
not acceptable,
because you've only

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.339
seen positive of red and blue.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.505
So you say, only red
and blue are acceptable.

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:37.005
Question?

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:39.183
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned that if we

00:07:39.183 --> 00:07:40.766
had seen incandescent
and fluorescent,

00:07:40.766 --> 00:07:42.840
it's OK that we could climb
the tree to light source,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.131
because it's more parsimonious.

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:47.217
If we then see one that's
sodium vapor, say a street lamp,

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.712
and we reject it, do we have
to go back down the tree,

00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:50.638
or do we just add a forbid-link?

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.471
PROFESSOR: Then you
would add a forbid-link.

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:55.240
The question is, we climb
incandescent, fluorescent,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.704
to light source.

00:07:56.704 --> 00:07:58.370
When we see sodium
vapor, what do we do?

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.240
The answer is, our system,
unlike with lattice learning,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.680
in arch learning, our
system is memoryless

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.970
of its previous examples.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.400
It's incapable of going
back down the tree.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.720
And so if you see
incandescent and fluorescent,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.461
climb up to light source,
you're only recourse,

00:08:14.461 --> 00:08:16.210
if you see that sodium
vapor doesn't work,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.292
is to forbid-link sodium vapor.

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:19.250
That's a good question.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.480
It shows good understanding
of how we work.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.474
So drop-link, as you see, red
and blue, they both are OK.

00:08:24.474 --> 00:08:26.890
You don't know about yellow,
so you can't just switch that

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.015
to a forbid-link to yellow.

00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:31.350
But then you see
yellow is also OK.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.900
What do you do?

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.429
You can drop the
link altogether,

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:36.120
save yourself space.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.470
If all the colors that you have
in the entire world are fine,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.380
you can just not have part
of your model be the color,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.809
and just say, any color is fine.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:48.500
Color must not be really
part of what defines a lamp.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.190
And I'd say it's not.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.810
I mean, it's what defines
a tacky lamp, I guess.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.890
But it's not what
defines a lamp.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.270
So that might be why color
isn't here to begin with.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.400
So to make yourself
do better on this,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.320
more knowledge
equals less search.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.080
Let's have more knowledge.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.980
There's only some of these
are used to generalize,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.110
to make our model more
accepting of new examples.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.950
And those are ones we
would use after we've

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.660
seen a positive hit,
sort of generalize,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.380
learn more things in the model.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.460
Some of these are used
to specialize and make

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.850
our model refined, make
our model more specific.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.440
You'd only use those
after you saw a near miss.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.296
So let's actually
separate those.

00:09:29.296 --> 00:09:30.670
That way you guys
will never make

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.630
the mistake of using one of
these in the wrong situation.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.460
And more knowledge, less search.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.510
And less search means
a faster quiz time.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.490
So require-link, what
do you guys think?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.864
Is that a specializer
or a generalizer?

00:09:42.864 --> 00:09:43.780
AUDIENCE: Specializer.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.370
PROFESSOR: Specializer,
that's right.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.801
We'd only use it when
we saw a near miss.

00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:49.704
Forbid-link, specializer
or generalizer?

00:09:49.704 --> 00:09:50.620
AUDIENCE: Specializer.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.578
PROFESSOR: Specializer.

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:54.370
We'd only forbid something
if we saw a miss.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.176
Climb-tree, specializer
or generalizer?

00:09:56.176 --> 00:09:57.050
AUDIENCE: Generalizer

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.140
PROFESSOR: Generalizer,
that's right.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.810
We'd only climb up to a more
generic thing in the tree

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.340
if we saw a positive example.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.364
Extend-set?

00:10:03.364 --> 00:10:04.280
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.238
PROFESSOR: Generalizer.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.920
We'd only extend the
things in our set

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.810
if we saw a positive example.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.124
Close-interval?

00:10:10.124 --> 00:10:11.040
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.373
PROFESSOR: That's a generalizer.

00:10:12.373 --> 00:10:15.710
We'd only make the
interval bigger

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:20.420
if we saw a positive example.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.640
Someone asks, what do you do
if you have like 10 to 30,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.050
and then you find a
negative example in 20?

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.937
It's generally pretty
annoying for this system

00:10:33.937 --> 00:10:35.020
to have to deal with that.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.300
There's a variety of
things you could do

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.510
based on your implementation.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:42.000
I've never seen us
ask it in a quiz.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.450
But one thing you could do is
forbid 20, exactly just 20,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:52.350
and just have a little
hole at exactly 20.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.350
So then drop-link--
specializer or generalizer?

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.310
AUDIENCE: Generalizer.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.830
PROFESSOR: Generalizer.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.310
This one's an easy
one to mess up

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.914
if you don't
understand the system.

00:10:58.914 --> 00:11:01.330
Because dropping, you think,
oh, getting rid of something.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.163
That's specializing.

00:11:02.163 --> 00:11:04.869
But actually no, you're
generalizing the entire area

00:11:04.869 --> 00:11:06.160
saying, we can forget about it.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.050
Because they're all good.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.061
All right, so given that, we
are set to do this problem.

00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:13.685
Hey, we have a pretty
reasonable amount

00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:16.880
of time considering that we
don't have to do our sums.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.670
It's great.

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.893
So our first example
is sort of one

00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:24.143
of those stand reading lights
that you sort of have it

00:11:24.143 --> 00:11:27.060
on a stand, and you can
adjust the little light

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.510
bulb up or down.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:35.190
It is an incandescent bulb.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:44.440
It has a height of 11 inches.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.835
And it's got a flat base.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.290
It's electric.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.090
It's got a shade.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.820
And it's a hit.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.780
It's a hit, a positive
example, a plus.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.110
It's good.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.740
So right away, we know
that we can only use

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.630
the S's or the G's?

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.250
The G's.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.250
We can only use the G's.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.041
Because it's a hit.

00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.740
So we're not going
to be requiring.

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.400
We're not to be
forbidding today.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.530
We're going to be happy
and using a generalizer.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.230
So I'll help do the first one.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.060
You guys will help
me do the next one.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.300
Or someone can say,
we didn't cover this,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.930
and I'll do the first
one, and we'll stop.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.480
So we've got an
incandescent light.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.590
That's the same as our model.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.400
We've got a height of 11 inches.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.660
Oh, our model only covers 24.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.910
Flat base-- that's
the same as our model.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.770
Electricity-- same as our model.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.860
Shade-- same as our model.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.860
So I say the only
difference is the height.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:55.030
I say we need to close the
interval, close-interval.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:02.290
And I say that our model
is the same as before,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:11.965
except for that height is
an element of 11 to 24.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.610
Simple enough-- I picked
the easy one for myself.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.900
Next one.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:42.430
So this one is going to be-- the
picture here didn't turn out.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.760
But it's basically a lamp
that doesn't have a shade.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.600
It just sort of has the
light shining on you.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.290
So it is a positive example.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:10.549
It's incandescent, height
equals 11.5, flat base,

00:14:10.549 --> 00:14:11.215
and electricity.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.315
All right, so first
of all, which kind

00:14:20.315 --> 00:14:24.302
would we use, specializing
or generalizing?

00:14:24.302 --> 00:14:25.260
AUDIENCE: Generalizing.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.170
PROFESSOR: Generalizing,
and particularly,

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.020
anyone want to take a
look at our model, which

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.760
is the starting model, except
for the height can go 11 to 24?

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.626
Which heuristic do
we need to use here?

00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:42.060
AUDIENCE: Drop-link.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.390
PROFESSOR: All right, people
are all saying drop-link.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.220
Yes, that's right.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.230
Someone said extend-set.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.940
Well, I suppose we could extend
the set to shade or not shade.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.220
But that's everything.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.960
So drop-link is the answer.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.990
We can drop the shade.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:02.190
Shade or not, this is
still pretty much a lamp.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.035
So that's correct.

00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:04.640
We drop-link.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.331
So the model--
all right, there's

00:15:13.331 --> 00:15:15.955
been enough changes to it that
I think I'll write it out again.

00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:24.070
The model is
incandescent, height

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:36.835
equals an element from 11 to 24,
and flat base, and electricity.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.335
Good, so question?

00:15:51.335 --> 00:15:57.275
AUDIENCE: So during
this all, we're

00:15:57.275 --> 00:16:00.740
editing our model based on the
order that the model is in,

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:01.706
right?

00:16:01.706 --> 00:16:04.205
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
we're editing the model based

00:16:04.205 --> 00:16:05.690
on the order of the examples?

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.165
AUDIENCE: What
happens if there's

00:16:08.165 --> 00:16:11.135
the same thing except with no
shade or something like that

00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:12.432
afterwards?

00:16:12.432 --> 00:16:13.890
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, what

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:19.080
happens if you have the same
thing except for that there's

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.070
one that's the same with no
shades and is a near miss

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.585
or something so
that you need to--

00:16:25.585 --> 00:16:28.200
or I'm sorry, you're saying,
what if there's one that has

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.500
a shade now that's a near miss?

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.950
And so it would probably
try to forbid-link shades.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.080
That's sort of the question?

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.920
You're right.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.710
That's an inconsistency
in the data.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.550
The system is very fragile.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:49.490
It's very fragile to
ordering in particular.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:53.690
And you'd be
surprised how awesome

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.370
this does considering that it
was made in, like, the '60s.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.930
It's pretty impressive stuff.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.670
But it's old.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.761
We're not saying that this
is a way that you should do

00:17:05.761 --> 00:17:07.010
all of your learning nowadays.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.530
Because it has some
serious issues.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.940
It's old, but it's pretty
damn good for what it did.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.200
A newer style of this kind
of learning made by me

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.510
and another friend who's
now working at Google

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.220
is lattice learning, which
has its own share of issues,

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.869
one of which is that
since it's trying

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.060
to act like a little
kid, at first it

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.690
tries to claim that everything
is OK until you show it

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.650
some good negative examples.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.330
But very particularly
one way gets around

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.610
this problem is
it's not memoryless.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.600
It in fact stores
all of the examples

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.740
it's ever seen and
compares and contrasts them

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.150
to what it sees in
the new example.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.137
And this allows it
to say something

00:17:46.137 --> 00:17:48.470
like-- let's say you're trying
to teach it what can fly.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.220
In lattice learning, you say,
all right, well, a blue jay

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.810
can fly.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.890
And then if you ask it,
can a cow fly, sure,

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.110
a cow jumped over the moon.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.140
Everything can fly.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.590
So that's its problem.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.780
But if you say, actually,
that was a nursery rhyme,

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.360
a cow cannot in fact
fly, it will then say,

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.980
only birds can fly.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.464
Because it remembers that
the blue jay can fly.

00:18:08.464 --> 00:18:11.005
And then you can eventually say,
well, actually bats can fly,

00:18:11.005 --> 00:18:12.190
a fruit bat can fly.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:16.967
Well, OK, so chiropterans
can fly and birds can fly.

00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:17.550
But that's it.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.280
And you can give it
some other examples.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.070
But there are other
styles of learning.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.670
You're absolutely right.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.680
In fact, if there's a
multiple choice asking you

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.760
about the strengths and
weaknesses of arch learning,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.000
one of the weaknesses-- it's
very vulnerable to ordering

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.530
of what you teach it.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.490
But think about it.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.720
If our first example
was one that's

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.000
exactly the same as
this but with a shade,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.400
and it was a miss, the system
would just yell at you.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.070
Like, you're kind of being an
asshole to it to give it two

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.530
things that are inconsistent.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.340
You might say in the
real world that happens.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.770
Well, arch learning, not great
with real world messy data.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.980
It just goes ballistic.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.750
It's very OCD.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.107
It wants everything to match up.

00:19:02.107 --> 00:19:03.940
If it gets two things
that are inconsistent,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.402
it'll just yell at you.

00:19:05.402 --> 00:19:06.490
It's like, you're wrong.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.020
This can't be true.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.390
Because you said it's
OK with the shade.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.970
So that's a very good question.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.083
Another question?

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.055
AUDIENCE: So if
you have a sample

00:19:15.055 --> 00:19:18.506
that had two different
things for the model,

00:19:18.506 --> 00:19:19.985
and it's a near miss--

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:21.464
PROFESSOR: It's not a near miss.

00:19:21.464 --> 00:19:23.247
The question is, if
you have something

00:19:23.247 --> 00:19:25.830
with two different things in the
model, and it's a near miss--

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.350
and I'm sorry to cut you off.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.510
Based on timing, I'm
just going to say,

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.030
whatever you said
afterwards doesn't

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:34.590
apply due to the fact at that
point it's not a near miss.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.820
It's very important.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.780
It's only a near miss if
there's only one change.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.300
Otherwise, it's just a miss.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.670
And if it's a miss with
more than one change,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.750
you were probably going to say,
how do you know what to change?

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.500
The answer is, you
can't change anything.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.700
Because any of them could
have been what was wrong.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:51.380
That's why for a hit, oh, it
can have as many differences

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:51.970
as you want.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.420
You'll just generalize them all.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.847
For a miss, it can only
have one thing different.

00:19:55.847 --> 00:19:58.180
In fact, there might be one
here that's not a near miss,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.870
and you just say, oh,
we don't do anything.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:00.578
We'll keep going.

00:20:00.578 --> 00:20:02.070
We might see it if we have time.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.650
So question?

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.725
AUDIENCE: Because ordering
is an important factor

00:20:05.725 --> 00:20:10.343
for this bigger thing,
and you encounter an item

00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:16.752
which has two
discrepancies in values,

00:20:16.752 --> 00:20:20.203
but if the ordering
were different such

00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:21.939
that that would
be accounted for,

00:20:21.939 --> 00:20:24.147
do you remember if you turn
back to that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:24.147 --> 00:20:25.872
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, let's say

00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:29.100
you have a non-near miss.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.580
Can you hold onto
it and use it later

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.480
when it would be a near miss?

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.800
The answer is, nope.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.030
If we're going here,
for a system that

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.580
doesn't remember things,
you can put in some kludges.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.000
That definitely
makes it smarter.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.220
It uses all its data.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.520
But Patrick in the '60s making
this up strove for elegance.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.800
And the elegant solution
is, let's just be memoryless

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.050
completely, the idea
being, well, little babies

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.650
can't tell you every experience
they had with playing

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.140
with blocks with an arch.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.170
So let's remember nothing.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.230
With lattice
learning, our idea is

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.280
that people sort of
somewhere in the subconscious

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.342
maybe do store all the
examples, or at least a lot

00:21:10.342 --> 00:21:11.800
more than you give
them credit for.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.500
So why not store them?

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.560
But with arch learning, it's,
little babies can't tell you,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.540
oh yeah, there's that one
time I played with a lamp,

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.302
and it didn't have
a shade, and so

00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:25.010
it wasn't a lamp, or
something like that.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.718
They're not going to
be able to store it.

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:29.892
They're not going to be
able to save it for later.

00:21:29.892 --> 00:21:31.350
Sort of in the
style of Turing, who

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.970
believed a human would be
a teacher to a computer,

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.780
arch learning really
focuses on the fact

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.320
that the human is a kind
and good teacher who

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.740
offers examples that are
exactly appropriate at the time.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.500
And that puts a lot
of pressure on you

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.330
as the trainer of an
arch learning system.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.230
Good questions, all.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.720
Let's continue
working this guy out.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:59.910
So the next example is
basically another one

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.420
of these stand lamps.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.340
It's got a light shining
down, which is fluorescent.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.165
It looks like this.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.760
It's fluorescent.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:22.250
Height equals 13 inches,
flat base, electric, shade.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.970
And yeah, as I put
here, it's a hit.

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.250
So as you guys have
told me countless times,

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.820
so I believe you
that you remember,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.840
we're going to
generalize for the hit.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.630
So what should we do here?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.620
So some people are
saying extend-set.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.560
AUDIENCE: Climb-tree.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.770
PROFESSOR: The people who are
saying climb-tree are correct.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.010
Why do we climb-tree
instead of extend-set?

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:04.620
Because of the fact that
it's a tree, not a set.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.060
And it is more
parsimonious to climb

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.750
the tree than it is to treat
it as a set and extend the set.

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:13.210
Sets don't have a hierarchy.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.560
It's just like red comma blue
comma yellow, or shade comma

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.950
not shade.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.830
Whenever you have
a tree, it's a fact

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.670
that it's more parsimonious
to just climb it

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.170
than it is to treat it
as a set and extend it,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.290
even though you could
do that, I suppose.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.320
And arch learning,
it's parsimonious.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.050
It's elegant.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.000
It's simple.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.710
And the elegant thing
to do-- just climb up.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.260
So yes, we're going
to climb up the tree.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:51.810
So our model is the same as last
time except that this time it

00:23:51.810 --> 00:24:02.200
has a light source instead
of saying, incandescent.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.720
It just climbed up to
light source, sure.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.880
All right, so the next
one is pretty cool.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.130
It's another one of those
fluorescent shine down lamps.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.060
But in space, it has a
tripod with three legs.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.890
And those legs all have wheels.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:21.050
So it is also a hit.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:39.000
So it is fluorescent, height
equals 14 inches, wheeled legs,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.950
and electric.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.900
So obviously we're generalizing.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.867
What heuristic will
we use this time?

00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:49.120
AUDIENCE: Climb-tree.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.370
PROFESSOR: Climb-tree
again, that's right.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:58.640
We're going to climb from flat
base to base support itself.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.266
Because wheeled
legs and flat base,

00:25:02.266 --> 00:25:04.200
base support is an
ancestor of both.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.677
So our model is
the same as before.

00:25:11.677 --> 00:25:13.260
But at this point,
it's changed enough

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.290
that I might as
well write it out.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:30.510
So we'll say that it is light
source, height between 11

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:38.644
and 24 inches, base support,
some sort of support,

00:25:38.644 --> 00:25:39.310
and electricity.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.360
Awesome, now, come on parity.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.890
Ah, no, back up, you.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.000
There we go.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.120
So that down there,
don't get confused.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:04.000
That down there is
our most recent model.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:16.520
We now have-- oh, oops, hehe.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:21.200
OK, I actually missed
one of the examples.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.250
However, we were actually
completely correct,

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.850
which gives away quite a lot.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:36.070
We had a miss, incandescent
bulb-- back in the old days

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.740
when incandescent was the
only kind of light we had.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:51.250
Height equals 60 inches,
flat, back in the old days

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:56.890
when flat was the only
one we had, electric,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.470
back in the old days
when we had electric.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.470
And we also have
shade after we've

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.660
dropped the link for shade.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.160
So we know that shade or
not shade are both OK.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:17.190
So the question
is, what do we do?

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.335
First of all, do we specialize
or generalize with this miss?

00:27:20.335 --> 00:27:21.210
AUDIENCE: Specialize.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.230
PROFESSOR: So obviously we're
only to be able to require

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.900
or forbid.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.890
So standardly, traditionally,
the answer would be nothing.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.405
However, we accept it
as sane the possibility

00:27:38.405 --> 00:27:41.780
that you might put a
require onto the height.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.730
Some students did
that, like say, oh

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.810
gosh, that's a
hard set, 11 to 24.

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.180
But that's not what
you would normally do.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.300
So just to show that we tried
to understand that there might

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.640
be multiple ideas in
a weird situation,

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.750
we did accept that
that one time.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.080
But generally, there's not
anything you have to do.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:06.690
This system at the time, and
still now, said 11 to 24.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.750
This is spookily exactly
the correct place

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.700
where this example would go.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.190
But you don't have to do
anything to the model.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.220
You don't have to
use any heuristics.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:23.301
OK, so last step, -- the
question is-- oh, question.

00:28:23.301 --> 00:28:28.768
AUDIENCE: So here, if we did
it in this particular order,

00:28:28.768 --> 00:28:31.253
having it be the
next [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:31.253 --> 00:28:34.235
in our example
list, then it only

00:28:34.235 --> 00:28:37.714
differs by one from our
existing model, right?

00:28:37.714 --> 00:28:39.482
PROFESSOR: No, it
differs by a lot.

00:28:39.482 --> 00:28:41.690
It actually wouldn't be a
near miss if we did it out.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.815
AUDIENCE: It would be a
near miss if we did it out.

00:28:43.815 --> 00:28:47.720
PROFESSOR: No, incandescent is
different than light source.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.510
Height is different than height.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.500
Flat is different
than base support.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.422
So it would differ
by a huge number,

00:28:58.422 --> 00:28:59.844
and it would not be a near miss.

00:28:59.844 --> 00:29:01.896
AUDIENCE: OK, then
here's a question.

00:29:01.896 --> 00:29:06.693
Even though on the
tree incandescent

00:29:06.693 --> 00:29:14.045
is a child branching
off of light source,

00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:18.130
if we instead encountered--
because our current model says

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.272
light source comma
whatnot, if instead we

00:29:21.272 --> 00:29:26.180
got a negative thing that
said, fluorescent, again,

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.720
would that be considered
not a near miss,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.116
because fluorescent
differs from light source?

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.770
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, would it

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:40.505
not be considered a near miss
if you had, say, fluorescent

00:29:40.505 --> 00:29:42.380
rather than light source,
because fluorescent

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.460
differs from light source?

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:47.798
So the answer there is--

00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:49.401
AUDIENCE: Since
it's memoryless, it

00:29:49.401 --> 00:29:52.380
doesn't know that fluorescent--

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.180
PROFESSOR: Well sure,
it is memoryless.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.971
It doesn't know that
fluorescent used to be

00:29:55.971 --> 00:29:57.300
a positive example before.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.620
Unfortunately, let's say
we did have an example that

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.600
was fluorescent, height
is an element of 11 to 24,

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.220
base support, electric.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.760
Actually, let's say we have
one that was sodium vapor,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:11.050
height is 13.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.820
Sodium vapor, height
is 13, base support--

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.032
for some reason it was called
base support and electric.

00:30:18.032 --> 00:30:18.990
That's possible, right?

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.930
We haven't seen a
positive of sodium vapor.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:23.570
Let's say that sodium
vapor was not allowed.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.570
If we don't say that that's a
near miss and then forbid-link

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.130
sodium vapor, how
are we ever going

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.090
to get rid of sodium vapor?

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.000
Unfortunately,
because of that, we

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.770
lose some amount
of expressiveness.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:41.572
Actually, what you're saying is
very logical and makes sense,

00:30:41.572 --> 00:30:43.530
that you would want to
have the ability to say,

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:44.560
OK, this is a subset.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.567
This should be OK.

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:47.150
But unfortunately,
because of the fact

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:48.566
that we climbed
the tree even when

00:30:48.566 --> 00:30:50.990
we haven't seen a positive
example for all things

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.670
in the bottom on that tree,
we actually lose that ability.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.180
It's a trade-off.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.870
It is most certainly a
weakness of arch learning

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.070
that you point out here.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.080
Lattice learning fixes that,
but it has its own problems.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.190
So you're right, that you'd
want to be able to do that.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.920
But you can't.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.000
Because it's memoryless.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.960
So last but not
least, which model

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:16.850
would we present in order
to teach the system, right

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:22.280
now from its final system, that
a lamp requires a base support?

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.590
So it would need to be
require-link for the base

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.310
support.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.710
So really fast--
incandescent bulb

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:33.340
with a height of 6, a flat
base, and electricity.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.320
Would that do it?

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.820
Incandescent bulb
with a height of 8

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.792
and a battery, incandescent
bulb with a height of 12, wire

00:31:39.792 --> 00:31:41.750
support, and electricity--
oh yeah, by the way,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:44.700
this will have to be a
miss to teach a require.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.510
Fluorescent bulb, height of 21,
clamp base, and electricity,

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.170
or incandescent
bulb, height of 12,

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.620
flat bottomed legs,
and electricity--

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.300
so did anyone pick that out over
the fastness of me saying it?

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.300
Because [INAUDIBLE] is
going to want to come in.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.279
Question or answer?

00:31:58.279 --> 00:31:59.195
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:02.038 --> 00:32:03.787
PROFESSOR: It's
going to have a miss.

00:32:03.787 --> 00:32:05.370
AUDIENCE: If it's
on the wire support?

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.330
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.480
So I know it was fast.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.224
You can look through
quiz 2007 final.

00:32:10.224 --> 00:32:12.390
Because [INAUDIBLE] is going
to come in in a minute.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.973
But it would be a
miss on the one that

00:32:13.973 --> 00:32:17.275
was correct on everything except
for it was a wire support.

00:32:17.275 --> 00:32:19.150
Then the question you
have is, wait a minute,

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.440
it says incandescent bulb.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.360
That is now a subset
of light source.

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.930
You have his question again.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:29.760
The answer to that is they
must have decided here

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.172
that that was OK.

00:32:31.172 --> 00:32:32.630
But on the other
hand, how would it

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.970
learn sodium vapor if that
wasn't decided to be OK?

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.570
That's going to have to be
an implementation detail.

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:42.590
So one thing you can do
is try to treat subsets

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.330
as OK in the logical way.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:46.200
Because questions may do that.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.960
And then I guess
you've lost the ability

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.730
to forbid, say, sodium vapor.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.110
So you have to lose
one or the other.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:56.320
I think you're definitely OK
to ask TAs or someone who's

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.960
proctoring if a
situation like that

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.570
comes up, which implementation
detail is chosen.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.820
Because you could choose
either when you're running

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.530
arch learning.
