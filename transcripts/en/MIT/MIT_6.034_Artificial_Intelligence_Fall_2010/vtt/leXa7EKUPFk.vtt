PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Ladies and gentlemen, the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.670
engineers drinking song.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.309
Back in the day, I've drunk
quite a lot to that song.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.420
And as drinking songs
go, it's not bad.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.260
I caution you, however, before
playing this song in the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.240
presence of small children,
audition it first.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.460
Some of the verses are
sufficiently gross as to make

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.130
a sailor go beyond blushing.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.380
It's an interesting song because
there are an infinite

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.580
number of verses.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.840
Here's the mathematical proof.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.920
Suppose there were a finite
number of verses.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.080
Then there would be
a last verse.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.540
And if there were a last verse,
then some drunk alumni

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.570
would compose a new one.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.400
Therefore, there is no last
verse, the size is not finite,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.430
and there are an infinite
number of verses.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.610
I play it for you today because
I'm an engineer.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.336
I like to build stuff.

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:09.010
I build stuff out of wood.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.810
I build stuff out of metal.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.830
I build stuff out of rocks.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.470
And I especially like
to write programs.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.180
I don't know, sometimes people
come to me and say, I'm

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.960
majoring in computer science,
but I don't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.030
like to write programs.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.470
I've always been mystified
by that.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.900
I mean, if you want to show how
tough you are, you can go

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.430
bungee jumping or drive a nail
through your hand or something

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.680
like that instead.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.750
But I've written quite a few
programs for demonstrating

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.650
stuff in this subject.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.520
They're all written in Java,
principally because I can

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.660
therefore make them available to
you and to the rest of the

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.785
world by way of Web Start.

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:55.050
A few weeks ago, I was mucking
around with the system and

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.490
broke the version on the server,
and within 15 minutes,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.490
I got an email from somebody
in the depths of Anatolia

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.960
complaining about it and asking
me to bring it back up.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.699
This particular program
is patterned

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.830
after an early AI classic.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.130
And it was the business end of
a program written by Terry

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.290
Winograd, who became, and is,
a professor of computer

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.220
science at Stanford
University--

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.940
which is on the west coast
for those of you--

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.510
on the strength of his work on
the natural language front end

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.100
of this program.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.260
But the natural language part
is not what makes it of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.080
interest for us today.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.440
It's more the other
kinds of stuff.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.550
Let's pile these things up.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.320
Now, I'm going to ask to
do something, maybe put

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.970
B2 on top of B7.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.840
Not bad.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.320
How about B6 on B3?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.880
This program's kind of clever.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.580
Let me do one more.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.280
Let's put B7 on B2.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.510
OK, now let's see.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.530
Maybe B5 on B2?

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.730
B4 on B3 first, maybe?

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.885
Oh, I must have clicked
the wrong button.

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:56.675
Oh, there it goes.

00:03:56.675 --> 00:03:58.780
OK.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.716
Let's put B4 on B1.

00:04:02.716 --> 00:04:08.190
Agh, my mouse keeps getting
out of control.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.519
Now, let's put B1 on B2.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.779
This is an example I'm
actually going to

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.029
work out on the board.

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:25.740
Oh, I see.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.750
My touch pad accidentally
got activated.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.440
B1 on B2.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.800
Now, let's ask a question.

00:04:58.075 --> 00:04:59.560
OK.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.190
Well.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.636
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:03.564
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Stop.

00:05:03.564 --> 00:05:07.420
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.866
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Had enough of that.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.550
Let's see.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.460
Why did you put--

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.720
why did you want to
get rid of B4?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.660
OK, one--

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.540
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.010
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Maybe
they think, that's what

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.575
happens when you use software
you write yourself.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:51.662
Why did you want to clear
the top of B2?

00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:55.050
Did I do that?

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.050
Why did you clear
the top of B1?

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.520
OK.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.400
SPEAKER 2: [SINGING]

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.700
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.460
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Oh, it's haunting me.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:09.290
Yeah.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.350
So the drinking song is easily
offended, I guess.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.310
But I won't develop that
scenario again.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.260
What I want to show you is that
this program looks like

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.430
it's kind of smart, and it
somehow can answer questions

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.230
about its own behavior.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.800
Have you ever written a program
that's answered

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.020
questions about its
own behavior?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.620
Probably not.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.322
Would you like to learn
how to do that?

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.680
OK.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.470
So by the end of the hour,
you'll be able to write this

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.400
program and many more like it
that know how to answer

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.040
questions about their
own behavior.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.020
There have been tens of
thousands of such programs

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.175
written, but only by people who
know the stuff I'm going

00:07:00.175 --> 00:07:03.080
to tell you about
right now, OK?

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.240
So what I want to do is I want
to start by taking this

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.500
program apart on the board and
talking to you about the

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.670
modules, the subroutines
that it contains.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.070
So here it is.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.280
The first thing we need
to think about,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.530
here are some blocks.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.500
What has to happen if I'm going
to put the bottom block

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.570
on the larger block?

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.680
Well, first of all, I have
to find space for it.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.340
Then I have to grasp
the lower block.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.380
And I have to move it and
I have to ungrasp it.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.620
So those are four things I need
to do in order to achieve

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.140
what I want to do.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:52.450
So therefore, I know that the
put-on method has four pieces.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.480
It has to find space on
the target block.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:05.500
It has to grasp the block that
it's been commanded to move.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.580
Then it has to move, and
then it has to ungrasp.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.680
But taking hints from some of
the questions that it did

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.350
answer before I got haunted by
the music, taking our cue from

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.850
that, we know that in order to
grasp something, in this

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.150
particular world, you can't have
anything on top of it.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:36.929
So grasp, therefore, may call
clear top in order to get

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.710
stuff off from the
target object.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.020
And that may happen in an
iterative loop because there

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.450
may be several things on top.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.120
And how do you get
rid of stuff?

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.370
Well, by calling get rid of.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.660
And that may go around
a loop several times.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:04.210
And then, the way you get rid of
stuff is by calling put-on.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.780
So that gives us recursion, and
it's from the recursion

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.110
that we get a lot of the
apparent complexity of the

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.920
program's behavior when
it solves a problem.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.830
Now, in order to find space,
you also have to

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.070
call get rid of.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.820
So that's where I meant to
put this other iterative

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.270
loop, not down here.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.400
Cleat top has got the iterative
loop inside of it.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.930
So that's the structure
of the program.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.610
It's extremely simple.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.810
And you might say to me, well,
how can you get such

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.140
apparently complex-looking
behavior out of

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.065
such a simple program?

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.665
A legitimate question.

00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:41.090
But before we tackle that one
head on, I'd like to do a

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.870
simulation of this program
with a very

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.120
simple blocks problem.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.380
And it's the one I almost
showed you, but

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.180
it goes like this.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.786
Here's B1.

00:09:54.786 --> 00:09:58.920
We'll call this BX because
I forgot its name.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.250
Here's BY.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.380
And here's B2.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:12.080
And the task is to
put B1 on B2.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.090
And according to our system
diagram, that results in four

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.410
calls to subroutines.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.660
We have to find space.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.995
We have to grasp B1.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.630
We have to move, and
then we ungrasp.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.260
Now, the way we grasp something
is the first thing

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.900
we have to do is clear
off its top.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.640
So grasp calls clear top.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.900
And clear top in turn
calls get rid of.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.620
And let me see.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.650
Let me keep track of these.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.630
This is clearing the top
of B1, and this is

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.230
getting rid of BX.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:34.685
And the way we get rid of BX is
by putting BX on the table.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:44.800
And then that in turn causes
calls to another find space,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.314
another grasp, another move,
and another ungrasp.

00:11:48.314 --> 00:11:51.410
So that's a little trace of
the program as it works on

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.960
this simple problem.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.440
So how does it go about
answering the questions that I

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.660
demonstrated to you
a moment ago?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.340
Let's do that by using
this trace.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:09.810
So how, for example, does it
answer the question, why did

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.060
you get rid of BX?

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.520
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.343
How can it answer
that question?

00:12:21.343 --> 00:12:22.593
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.480
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
it goes up one level and

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.590
reports what it sees.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.800
So it says, and said in the
demonstration, I got rid of BX

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.660
because I was trying to
clear the top of B1.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.325
So if I were to say why did you
clear the top of B1, it

00:12:44.325 --> 00:12:47.015
would say because I was
trying to grasp it.

00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:49.840
If I were to say, why did you
grasp B1, it would say because

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.990
I was putting B1 on B2.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.120
If I say, why did you put
B1 on B2, it would say,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.910
slavishly, because
you told me to.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.770
OK, so that's how it deals
with why questions.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.620
How about how questions?

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.680
Timothy, what do you think
about that one?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.400
How would it go about answering
a question about how

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.650
you did something?

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.400
Do you have a thought?

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.428
TIMOTHY: Um, yeah, it would
think about what I was trying

00:13:21.428 --> 00:13:21.750
to accomplish.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.820
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, but

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:22.710
how would it do that?

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.550
How would the program do that?

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.150
We know that answering
a why question makes

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.710
it go up one level.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.660
How does it answer
a how question?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.800
Sebastian?

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.560
SEBASTIAN: It goes
down one level.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.420
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
You go down one level.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:40.210
So you start off all the way
up here with a put-on.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.360
You will say, oh, well I
did these four things.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.890
You say, why did you grasp B1?

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:46.170
It will say because I was
trying to clear its top.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.960
Why did you clear its top?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.930
Because I was trying
to get rid of it.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.080
Why were you trying
to get rid of it?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.890
Because I was trying to
put it on the table.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.570
So that's how it answers how
questions, by going down in

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:02.280
this tree and this trace of the
program of action so as to

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.100
see how things are
put together.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.940
What are these things that
are being put together?

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.460
What's the word I've been
avoiding so as to bring this

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.360
to a crescendo?

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.310
What are these objectives, these
things it wants to do?

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.530
They're goals.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:25.780
So this thing is leaving a
trace, which is a goal tree.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.260
Does that sound familiar?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.400
Three days ago, we talked about
goal trees in connection

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.820
with integration.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.440
So this thing is building a goal
tree, also known as an

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.320
and-or tree.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.940
So this must be an and tree.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.300
And if this is an and tree,
are there any and nodes?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.590
Sure, there's one right there.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.030
So do you think then that you
can answer questions about

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.740
your own behavior as long as
you build an and-or tree?

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.232
Sure.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:00.880
Does this mean that the
integration program could

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.110
answer questions about
its own behavior?

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.990
Sure.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.140
Because they both build goal
trees, and wherever you got a

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.270
goal tree, you can answer
certain kinds of questions

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.520
about your own behavior.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:22.910
So let me see if in fact it
really does build itself a

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.660
goal tree as it solves
problems.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.560
So this time, we'll put
B6 on B3 this time.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.000
But watch it develop
its goal tree.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.950
So in contrast to the simple
example I was working on the

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.726
board, this gets to be a pretty
complicated goal tree.

00:15:49.726 --> 00:15:52.550
But I could still answers
questions about behavior.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:59.430
For example, I could say, why
did you put B6 on B3?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.790
Because you told me to.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.090
All right, so the complexity of
the behavior is largely a

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.780
consequence not of the
complexity of the program in

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.230
this particular case, but the
building of this giant goal

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.880
tree as a consequence of the
complexity of the problem.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.400
This brings us to one of
our previous matters--

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.130
early on to one of the gold
star ideas of today.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:29.080
And this gold star idea goes
back to a lecture given in the

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.470
late '60s by Herb Simon, who was
the first Nobel Laureate

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.030
in the pseudo Nobel Prize
for economics.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.690
Is that right, Bob?

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:37.390
Was he the first?

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.810
All right, he was the first
winner of the Nobel Prize,

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.800
pseudo Nobel Prize
in economics.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.170
And in this lecture, which was
titled "The Sciences of the

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.500
Artificial," he said imagine
that you're looking on a beach

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.705
at the path of a ant.

00:16:53.705 --> 00:16:56.580
And he said, well, you know,
the path of the ant looks

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.070
extremely complicated.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.640
And you're tempted to think the
ant is some kind of genius

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.670
or monster brain ant.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:10.780
But in fact, when you take a
closer look, what you discover

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.490
is that there are a bunch of
pebbles on the beach, and all

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.609
the ant is doing is avoiding
those pebbles on his way home.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:23.450
So the complexity of the
behavior, said Simon, is a

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.900
consequence of the complexity
of the environment, not the

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.900
complexity of the program.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.620
So that's the metaphoric
Simon's ant.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:39.910
And what it says is that the
complexity of the behavior is

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:50.270
the max of the complexity of the
program and the complexity

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.520
of the environment.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.960
So that's something we'll see
many times during the rest of

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.830
the semester.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.000
Complex behavior,
simple program.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.105
You think it's going
to be complicated.

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:09.130
It turns out to be simple
because the problem has the

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.810
complexity, not the program.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.350
So that brings us to check box
three in today's talk, and

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.520
there's a little bit of a scene
here because now I want

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.140
to stop talking about
goal-centered programming and

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.840
start talking about rule-based
expert systems.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:35.190
The rule-based expert systems
were developed in a burst of

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.870
enthusiasm about the prospects
for commercial applications of

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:45.530
artificial intelligence
in the mid-1980s.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:50.010
At that time, it was supposed
lengthy articles are written,

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.620
but you could account for
useful aspects of human

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.980
intelligence by writing all the
knowledge in the form of

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.870
simple rules.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.700
So if this is true,
then that's true.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.070
If you want to achieve
this, then do that.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.690
But all the knowledge had to be
encapsulated in the form of

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.440
simple rules.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.780
So what might you want
to do with this?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.110
All sorts of things.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.510
Thousands of these systems
were written,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.760
as I indicated before.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.890
But here's an example.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.790
I'm going to work out an example
having to do with

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.870
identification.

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:28.980
And this example is patterned
off of a classic program,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.885
strangely also written at
Stanford, called MYCIN.

00:19:31.885 --> 00:19:34.210
It was developed to
diagnose bacterial

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.470
infections in the blood.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.140
So you come in.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.800
You got some horrible disease,
and the doctor gets curious

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.880
about what antibiotic would be
perfect for your disease.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.500
He starts asking a
lot of questions.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.710
So I'm not going to deal with
that because that world has

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:59.250
all kinds of unpronounceable
terms like bacterioides and

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:01.310
anaerobic and stuff like that.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.770
So it's completely analogous
to talk about identifying

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:12.210
animals in a little zoo, sort
of a small town type of zoo.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.320
So I'm going to suggest that
we write down on a piece of

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.710
paper all the things we can
observe about an animal, and

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:23.210
then we'll try to figure
out what the animal is.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.610
So I don't know, what
can we start with?

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:27.860
Has hair.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.660
Then there are some
characteristics of the

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.080
following form.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.330
Has claws.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.840
Sharp teeth.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.060
And forward-pointing eyes.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.120
And these are all
characteristics of carnivores.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.190
We happen to have
forward-pointing eyes too, but

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:12.560
that's more because we used to
swing around the trees a lot,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.420
and we needed the
stereo vision.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.530
And we don't have the claws
and the sharp teeth

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.400
that go with it.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.030
But anyhow, those are typically
characteristics of

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.040
carnivores, as is eating meat.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.090
And this particular little
animal we're looking at has

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.435
also got spots, and
it's very fast.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.550
What is it?

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:44.480
Well, everybody says
it's a cheetah.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.970
Let's see how our program
would figure that out.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:53.210
Well, program might say, let's
see if it has hair, then rule

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.985
one says that that means
it must be a mammal.

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.450
We can imagine another rule that
says if you have sharp

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.410
claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, then

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.750
you're a carnivore.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:17.670
And I'm using sort of hardware
notation here.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.940
That's an and gate, right?

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:23.040
So that means we have to have
all of these characteristics

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.170
before we will conclude that
the animal is a carnivore.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.870
Now, this animal has been also
observed to eat meat.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.750
So that means we've got extra
evidence that the animal is

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.700
carnivorous.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:52.020
And now, because the animal is
a mammal and a carnivore and

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:59.700
has spots, and it's very fast,
then the animal is a cheetah.

00:23:05.116 --> 00:23:07.850
And I hope all of our African
students agree that

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:09.000
it must be a cheetah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.980
It's a small zoo--

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.420
I mean, a big zoo.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:11.830
Who knows what it is?

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.700
It's probably got some
unpronouncable name--

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.990
there's possibilities.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.010
But for our small zoo,
that will do.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.260
So we have group now written
down in the form

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.270
of these and gates.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.030
Several rules, R1, R2--
and there needs to

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.040
be an and gate here--

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.665
that's R3 and an R4.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.500
All of which indicate that
this animal is a cheetah.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.155
So we built ourself a little
rule-based expert system that

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.400
can recognize exactly one
animal, but you could imagine

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.540
filling out this system with
other rules so that you could

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.750
recognize giraffes and penguins
and all the other

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.590
sorts of things you find
in a small zoo.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.920
So when you have a system like
this that works as I've

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.236
indicated, then what we're
going to call that, we're

00:24:01.236 --> 00:24:04.660
going to give that a special
name, and we're going to call

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:16.560
that a forward-chaining
rule-based--

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.810
because it uses rules--

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.403
expert system.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.050
And we're going to put expert
in parentheses because when

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.280
these things were developed,
for marketing reasons, they

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.470
called them expert systems
instead of novice systems.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.490
But are they really experts
in a human sense?

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:51.880
Not really, because they have
these knee-jerk rules.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.500
They're not equipped with
anything you might want to

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.800
call common sense.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.700
They don't have an ability to
deal with previous cases, like

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.940
we do when we go to
medical school.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.170
So they really ought to be
called rule-based novice

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.120
systems because they reason
like novices on

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.170
the basis of rules.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.585
But the tradition
is to call them

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.590
rule-based expert systems.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:18.310
And this one works forward from
the facts we give it to

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.260
the conclusion off
on the right.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.350
That's why it's a
forward-chaining system.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.420
Can this system answer
questions

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.670
about its own behavior?

00:25:34.715 --> 00:25:36.160
[INAUDIBLE], what
do you think?

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:36.900
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.010
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Why?

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.986
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:40.986 --> 00:25:41.730
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Because it

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.466
looks like a goal tree.

00:25:43.466 --> 00:25:44.960
Right.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.130
This is, in fact, building a
goal tree because each of

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:55.000
these rules that require several
things to be true is

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.920
creating an and node.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.180
And each of these situations
here where you have multiple

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.190
reasons for believing that the
thing is a carnivore, that's

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.960
creating an or node.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.820
And we already know that you
can answer questions about

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:10.440
your own behavior if you leave
behind a trace of a goal tree.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.620
So look at this.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:20.260
If I say to it, why were
you interested in

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.520
the animal's claws?

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.020
Because I was trying to see
if it was a carnivore.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.710
How did you know that the
animal is a mammal?

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.190
Because it has hair.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.450
Why did you think it
was a cheetah?

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.190
Because it's a mammal,
a carnivore, has

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.010
spots, and very fast.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.570
So by working forward and
backward in this goal tree,

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.990
this too can answer questions
about its own behavior.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:47.020
So now you know how, going
forward, you can write

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.900
programs that answer questions
about their behavior.

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.950
Either you write the subroutines
so that each one

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.710
is wrapped around a goal, so
you've got goal-centered

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:59.420
programming, or you build a
so-called expert system using

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.010
rules, in which case it's easy
to make it leave behind a

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.180
trace of a goal tree, which
makes it possible to answer

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.670
questions about its own
behavior, just as this

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:09.170
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.420
program did.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.330
But now, a little
more vocabulary.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:20.260
I'm going to save time by
erasing all of these things

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.210
that I previously drew by
way of connections.

00:27:25.818 --> 00:27:33.610
And I'm going to approach this
zoo in a little different way.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:39.360
I'm going to not ask any
questions about the animal.

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.510
Instead, I'm going to say,
mommy, is this thing I'm

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.220
looking at a cheetah?

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.640
And how would mommy go about
figuring it out.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.330
In her head, she would say,
well, I don't know.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.425
If it's going to be a cheetah,
then it must be the case that

00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:05.010
it's a carnivore, and it must be
the case that it has spots.

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:09.350
And it must be the case
that it's very fast.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.210
So so far, what we've
established is that if it's

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.940
going to be a cheetah, it
has to have the four

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.880
characteristics that
mommy finds behind

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.440
this rule are four.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.710
So instead of working forward
from facts, what I'm going to

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:31.460
do is work backward
from a hypothesis.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.720
So here the hypothesis is
this thing is a cheetah.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.110
How do I go about showing
whether that's true or not?

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:44.250
Well, I haven't done anything so
far because all I know is a

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.740
cheetah if all these things are
true, but are they true?

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:51.160
Well, to find out if it's a
mammal, I can use rule one.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.270
And if I know or can determine
that the animal has hair, then

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.790
that part of it is
taken care of.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.990
And I can similarly work my way
back through carnivore.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:06.870
I say, well, it's a carnivore if
it has claws, sharp teeth,

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.680
and forward-pointing eyes.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.860
And then as much as the
animal in question

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.720
does, then I'm through.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.555
I know it's a carnivore.

00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:16.980
I don't have to go through and
show that it's a carnivore

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.230
another way.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.400
So I never actually ask
questions about

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.600
whether it eats meat.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.720
Finally, the final two
conditions are met by just an

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.020
inspection of the animal.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.300
That's to say, it's
in the database.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.400
I don't have to use any rules
to determine that the animal

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.290
has spots and is very fast.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.610
So now, I've got everything in
place to say that it's a

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.490
cheetah, because it's a
carnivore, because it has

00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:45.330
claws, sharp teeth, and
forward-pointing eyes, and all

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.980
the rest of this stuff is
similarly determined by going

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:54.170
backwards, backwards from the
hypothesis toward the facts,

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.730
instead of from the facts
forward to the conclusions.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:09.180
So building a system that works
like that, I have a

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:15.980
backward-chaining rule-based
expert system.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.040
But there's a very important
characteristic of this system

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.620
in both backward and forward
mode, and that is that this

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.400
thing is a deduction system.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.760
That's because it's
working with facts

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.750
to produce new facts.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:35.730
When you have a deduction
system, you can never take

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.920
anything away.

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.790
But these rule-based systems are
also used in another mode,

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.530
where it's possible to
take something away.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.110
See, in fact world, in deduction
world, you're

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.920
talking about proving things.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.320
And once you prove something
is true, it can't be false.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.100
If it is, you've got a
contradiction in your system.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.340
But if you think of this as a
programming language, if you

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.510
think of using rules as a
programming language, then you

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:04.770
can think of arranging it so
these rules add or subtract

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.380
from the database.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.500
Let me show you an example
of a couple of systems.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.650
First of all, since I've talked
about the MYCIN system,

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:41.910
let me show you an example
of a MYCIN dialogue.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.750
That's a MYCIN dialogue.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:47.320
And you can see the appearance
of words you have to go to

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.570
medical school to learn.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.830
And here's a typical MYCIN rule,
just like the rules for

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:58.252
doing zoo analysis, only a
more complicated domain.

00:31:58.252 --> 00:32:01.130
But here's another example of a
system that was written, not

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.300
in the '80s, but just a couple
of years ago by a student in

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.340
the architecture department,
Ph.D. thesis.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.150
He was interested in the
architecture of a Portuguese

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.250
architect named Siza.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.180
And Siza's done a lot of
mass housing stuff.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.570
And Siza has the idea that you
ought to be able to design

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:22.500
your own house.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:27.240
And so Jose Duarte, a Portuguese
student, a Ph.D.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.260
student in architecture, wrote
a rule-based system that was

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.950
capable of designing Siza-like
houses in response to the

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:39.080
requirements and recommendations
and desires of

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.740
the people who are going
to occupy the houses.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.150
So the most compelling part of
this thing, of this exercise,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:51.780
was that Duarte took some of
the designs of the program,

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:55.330
mixed them up with some of the
designs of Siza, and put them

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.840
in front of Siza, and said,
which ones did you do?

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:01.550
And Siza couldn't tell.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.600
So somehow, the rule-based
system that was built using

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.530
this kind of technology was
sufficient to confuse even the

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:13.040
expert that they were
patterned after.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.555
But this program is a
little complicated.

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:17.710
It, too, has its own
specialized lingo.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.460
So I'm not going to talk about
it in detail, but rather talk

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.320
instead about an analogous
problem.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.910
And that is a problem that
everyone has faced at one

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:31.210
point or another, and that
is the problem of putting

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.952
groceries in a bag at
a grocery store.

00:33:34.952 --> 00:33:37.110
It's the same thing, right?

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.770
Instead of putting rooms in
a house, you're putting

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:41.660
groceries in a bag.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.640
And there must be some rules
about how to do that.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.910
In fact, maybe some of you have
been professional grocery

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.420
store baggers?

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.870
[INAUDIBLE] a grocery store
professional bagger.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.760
You're a--

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.480
which one?

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.850
LISA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:01.475
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Yeah, what is your name?

00:34:01.475 --> 00:34:01.770
LISA: Lisa.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.120
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Lisa.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.640
OK, well we got two
professional

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.730
grocery store baggers.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.429
And I'm going to be now
simulating a highly paid

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.800
knowledge engineer desirous of
building a program that knows

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.300
how to bag groceries.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.300
So I'm going to visit your site,
Market Basket, and I'm

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.889
going to ask Lisa, now fearful
of losing her job, if she

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:30.250
would tell me about how
she bags groceries.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:32.780
So could you suggest a rule?

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.226
LISA: Sure.

00:34:34.226 --> 00:34:36.154
Large items in the bottom.

00:34:36.154 --> 00:34:37.600
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Large
items in the bottom.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.350
You see, that's why I'm a
highly paid knowledge

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.090
engineer, because I translate
what she said

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:44.090
into an if-then rule.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.300
So if large, then bottom.

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.370
So now I--

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.030
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.020
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
how about you, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.270
Have you got a suggestion?

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.355
About how to bag groceries?

00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:59.840
SPEAKER 6: The small
things on top.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.180
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
If small, then on top.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.690
Lisa, have you got anything
else you could tell me?

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.070
LISA: Don't put too many heavy
things in the same bag.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.500
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Don't put too many heavy

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.750
things in the same bag.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:14.330
So if heavy greater than
three, then new bag, or

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.560
something like that.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.615
Is that all we're going to be
able to-- does anybody else

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.430
want to volunteer?

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.677
[INAUDIBLE], have you bagged
groceries in Turkey?

00:35:20.677 --> 00:35:22.665
LISA: So they don't
have grocery

00:35:22.665 --> 00:35:26.144
baggers, so we have to--

00:35:26.144 --> 00:35:27.635
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
everybody's a professional

00:35:27.635 --> 00:35:28.640
bagger in Turkey.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:28.915
Yeah.

00:35:28.915 --> 00:35:30.165
It's outsourced to
the customers.

00:35:32.324 --> 00:35:34.694
SPEAKER 7: So no squishies
on the bottom.

00:35:34.694 --> 00:35:35.642
So if you have--

00:35:35.642 --> 00:35:36.590
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: No
squishies on the bottom.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:37.064
SPEAKER 7: If you
have tomatoes--

00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:38.050
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
That's good.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:38.400
Tomatoes.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.260
SPEAKER 7: You don't want
them to get squished.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.880
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: Now,
there's a very different

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.070
thing about squishies and
tomatoes because tomato is

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.395
specific, and squishy isn't.

00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:49.090
Now, one tendency of MIT
students, of course, is that

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.270
we all tend to generalize.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.190
I once knew a professor
in the Sloan School

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.270
who seemed real smart.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.240
And--

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.150
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.410
PROFESSOR PATRICK
WINSTON: Then I

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.270
figured out what he did.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:06.250
If I were to say, I'm thinking
about a red apple.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.720
They'd sit back and say, oh,
I see you're contemplating

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.330
colored fruit today.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.740
They're just taking it up one
level of abstraction.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.530
Not a genius.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.320
He also was able to talk for
an hour after he drew a

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.460
triangle on the board.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.520
Amazing people.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.160
Anyhow, where were we?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.690
Oh, yes, bagging groceries.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.690
So we're making some progress,
but not as

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.950
much as I would like.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.800
And so in order to really make
progress on tasks like this,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.790
you have to exercise--

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:43.040
you know about some principles
of knowledge engineering.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:48.310
So principle number one, which
I've listed over here as part

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.950
of a gold star idea, is deal
with specific cases.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.870
So while you're at the site, if
all you do is talk to the

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:59.210
experts like Lisa and
[INAUDIBLE], all you're going

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.490
to get is vague generalities
because they won't think of

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.260
everything.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.620
So what you do is you
say, well, let me

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.870
watch you on the line.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.810
And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.540
dealing with the milk.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.220
And then you'll see that they
have to have some way of

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.600
dealing with the potato chips.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.150
Nobody mentioned potato chips,
except insofar as they might

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.400
be squishy.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.520
We don't have a definition
for squishy.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.840
Nobody talked about
the macaroni.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:29.790
And no one talked about
the motor oil.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.050
This is a convenience store.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:35.240
I don't want that in the
same bag with the meat.

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.890
And then no one talked
about canned stuff.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:40.450
Here's a can of olives.

00:37:40.450 --> 00:37:45.930
So by looking at specific cases,
you elicit from people

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.620
knowledge they otherwise would
not have thought to give you.

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.450
That's knowledge engineering
rule number one.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.310
And within a very few minutes,
you'll have all three

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:59.480
knowledge engineering rules and
be prepared to be a highly

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.730
paid knowledge engineer.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.350
Heuristic, let's call
these heuristics.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.120
Heuristic number one,
specific cases.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.100
Heuristic number two is ask
questions about things that

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.070
appear to be the same, but are
actually handled differently.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:20.888
So there's some Birds Eye
frozen peas, and here--

00:38:20.888 --> 00:38:27.160
ugh, some fresh cut
sweet peas.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.540
And to me, the person who's
never touched a grocery bag in

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.900
my life-- maybe I'm
from Mars--

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.990
I can't tell the difference.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.910
They're both peas.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.980
But I observe that the experts
are handling these objects

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.650
differently.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.940
So I say, why did you handle
those peas differently from

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.250
those peas, and what
do they say?

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:51.410
One's canned, and
one's frozen.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.150
So what happens?

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:57.280
Bingo, I've got some new
words in my vocabulary.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.660
And those new vocabulary words
are going to give me power

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.570
over the domain because
I can now use

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.380
those words in my rules.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.540
And I can write rules like if
frozen, then put them all

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.910
together in a little
plastic bag.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:11.660
Actually, that's too
complicated, but that's what

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.000
we end up doing, right?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.720
Why do we put them
all together in a

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.141
little plastic bag?

00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:18.105
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:18.105 --> 00:39:19.087
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?

00:39:19.087 --> 00:39:20.070
SPEAKER 8: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:20.690
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Well, there are two

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:21.940
explanations.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:26.750
There's the MIT explanation.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.120
We know that temperature flow
is equal to the fourth power

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.400
of the temperature difference
and the surface area and all

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.130
that kind of stuff.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:39.500
We want to get them all together
in a ball, sphere.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.660
The normal explanation is that
they're going to melt anyway,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.808
so they might as well not
get everything else wet.

00:39:43.808 --> 00:39:44.784
All right.

00:39:44.784 --> 00:39:50.640
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER]

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.760
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
that's heuristic number two.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:56.140
And actually, there's heuristic
number three, that I

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.860
just want to relate to you for
the first time because I have

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.770
been dealing with it a lot
over this past summer.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.160
Heuristic number three is you
build a system, and you see

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.820
when it cracks.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.770
And when it cracks is when you
don't have one of the rules

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.130
you need in order to execute--

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.180
in order to get the program
to execute as

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.890
you want it to execute.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.730
So if I were to write a grocery
store bagging program

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.290
and have it bag some groceries,
again, eventually

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.680
it would either make a mistake
or come to a grinding halt,

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.350
and bingo, I know that there's
a missing rule.

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:32.090
Isn't that what happens when you
do a problem set, and you

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.360
hit an impasse?

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.920
You're performing an experiment
on yourself, and

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:40.560
you're discovering that you
don't have the whole program.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.140
In fact, I've listed this as a
gold star idea having to do

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.460
with engineering yourself
because all of these things

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.400
that you can do for knowledge
engineering are things you can

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.170
do when you learn a new
subject yourself.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.730
Because essentially, you're
making yourself into an expert

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.940
system when you're learning
circuit theory or

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.230
electromagnetism or something
of that sort.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.420
You're saying to yourself,
well, let's look at some

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:04.310
specific cases.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.870
Well, what are the vocabulary
items here that tell me why

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.450
this problem is different
from that problem?

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.380
Oh, this is a cylinder
instead of a sphere.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.200
Or you're working with a problem
set, and you discover

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.000
you can't work with the problem,
and you need to get

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.860
another chunk of knowledge
that makes it possible

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.600
for you to do it.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.260
So this sort of thing, which
you think of primarily as a

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.400
mechanism, heuristics for doing
knowledge engineering,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.515
are also mechanisms for making
yourself smarter.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:40.990
So that concludes what I want to
talk with you about today.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.320
But the bottom line is, that
if you build a rule-based

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.880
expert system, it can
answer questions

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.540
about its own behavior.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.850
If you build a program that's
centered on goals, it can

00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:51.815
answer questions about
its own behavior.

00:41:51.815 --> 00:41:54.190
If you build an integration
program, it can answer

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.120
questions about its
own behavior.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.950
And if you want to build one of
these systems, and you need

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.760
to extract knowledge from an
expert, you need to approach

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.610
it with these kinds of
heuristics because the expert

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.320
won't think what to tell you
unless you elicit that

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.680
information by specific cases,
by asking questions about

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.760
differences, and by ultimately
doing some experiments to see

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.850
where your program is correct.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:19.960
So that really concludes what I
had to say, except I want to

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:25.080
ask the question, is this all
we need to know about human

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.010
intelligence?

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.260
Can these things be--

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.500
are these things really smart?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.890
And the traditional answer is
no, they're not really smart

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:39.610
because their intelligence is
this sort of thin veneer.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:44.090
And when you try to get
underneath it, as written,

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.160
they tend to crack.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.030
For example, we talk about a
rule, we could talk about a

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.290
rule that knows that you should
put the potato chips on

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.540
the top of the bag.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.375
But a program that knows that
would have no idea why you

00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:03.660
would want to put the potato
chips on top of the bag.

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:05.610
They wouldn't know that if you
put them on the bottom of the

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.870
bag, they'll get crushed.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:13.310
And it wouldn't know that if
they get crushed, the customer

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:17.630
will get angry, because people
don't like to eat crushed

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.340
potato chips.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.280
So that's what I mean when I
say the knowledge of these

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.790
things tends to be a veneer.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:28.000
So the MYCIN program, during
debugging, once prescribed a

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.595
barrel of penicillin to be
administered to a patient for

00:43:31.595 --> 00:43:34.340
its disease.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.510
They don't know, they don't
have any common sense.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:43.620
So the question then becomes,
well, I don't know.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.460
Does rule-based--

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:50.550
do rules have anything to
do with common sense?

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.340
And I'm becoming a little bit
agnostic on that subject.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:00.440
Because there are certain
indications, there are certain

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:06.600
situations, in which rules could
be said to play a role

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.495
in our ordinary understanding
of things.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.560
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.060
What I'm going to show you,
when the clip speaks up--

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.640
well, before I make any
promises, let me see if I'm

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.910
actually connected to the web.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.770
MIT, good.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.820
MIT.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.700
Guest.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.950
Yeah, that's me.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.070
Sounds good.

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.650
OK, I just tested the system,
and I've seen it is actually

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:28.330
connected to the web.

00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:32.230
And I'm going to adjust some
systems options here.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:35.120
I'll get rid of the text box.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.160
And we'll get rid of those
changes scale a little bit.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.780
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to read a little

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.050
synopsis of the Macbeth plot.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.190
You're MIT students.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:46.920
I'm sure you're all classically
educated and very

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.830
familiar with Shakespearean
plots.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.980
So I'm going to read one.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.330
I'm going to read a version
of a Macbeth plot.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.260
And it's going to go
along like this.

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:03.040
It's basically reading
a rule base so far.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.910
And pretty soon, it's going to
get beyond the rule base and

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.435
start reading the
Macbeth story.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.740
And there it is.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.720
It's read the Macbeth story.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.860
Let me show you what the Macbeth
story looks like as

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.660
it's actually retained
by the system.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.320
That's it.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.570
Read that.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.310
OK, you ran out of
time because the

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:28.490
machine's already finished.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.830
It takes about five seconds
to read this story.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.920
Now, as you look at this little
synopsis of Macbeth,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.510
there are a couple
things to note.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:39.090
For one thing, it says that
Duncan is murdered.

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.650
Duncan, I hope this doesn't
bother you.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.530
Duncan is murdered by Macbeth.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.205
But at no time does it say
that Duncan is dead.

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:50.800
But you know Duncan's dead
because he was murdered.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:53.168
If murdered, then dead.

00:46:53.168 --> 00:46:55.000
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.640
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
if you look a little further

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.890
down, what you see is that
Macduff kills Macbeth.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.260
Fourth line up from
the bottom.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:08.410
Why did Macduff kill Macbeth?

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:11.630
Doesn't say why in this story,
but you have no trouble

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:16.950
figuring out that it's
because he got angry.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.970
And when you get angry, you
don't necessarily kill

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.300
somebody, but it's possible.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.190
SPEAKER 3: [LAUGHTER].

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.240
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: So
now that you see what's in the

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.550
story, let me take you
back to this display.

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:31.210
It's what we call an
elaboration graph.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.360
And when I blow it up, you can
see that there's some familiar

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.340
looking things in there.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.630
For example, up here in the
left-hand corner, Macbeth

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.700
murders Duncan, right
over there.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.510
And over here, Macduff
kills Macbeth.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:50.710
And if you look at what is a
consequence of that, it looks

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.010
like there must be a rule that
says if you murder somebody,

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:54.670
you harm them.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:58.540
And if you murder somebody,
then they're dead.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.270
And one reason why you might
kill somebody is because they

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.500
angered you.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.880
And if you go the other way,
one consequence of killing

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:10.160
somebody is that you harm them,
and that they die too.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.120
And if you harm somebody, they
get angry, and their state

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.370
goes negative.

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:22.550
So that suggests that there are
some things that we have

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.145
on our hands that are very
compiled and very, strangely

00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:30.970
enough, very rule-like
in their character.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:35.730
Now, to close, I'm just
going to read Hamlet.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:38.900
The Hamlet demonstration is
much like the Macbeth one.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:42.270
In fact, Hamlet and Macbeth are
very alike in their plot.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.530
But there's one thing that's
well-illustrated by our

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:47.940
particular capturing
of Hamlet here.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.910
And that is that you'll note
that the ratio of gray stuff

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.060
to white stuff is
considerable.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:59.810
The gray stuff is stuff that
has been deduced by rules.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.140
And the reason there's so much
gray stuff in this Hamlet

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.380
story is because everybody's
related to everybody else.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:08.920
So when you kill anybody, you
irritate everybody else.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:13.750
So look at that.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.310
A few white things, those are
the things that are explicit

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.630
in the story, and lots
of gray stuff.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.270
So what this is suggesting is
that when we tell a story,

00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:25.440
it's mostly a matter of
controlled hallucination.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:28.560
I know what rules are in your
head, so I could take

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.030
advantage of that in telling the
story and not have to tell

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.490
you anything I'm sure you're
going to know.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.640
And so that's why, we've
discovered, that storytelling

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.500
is largely a matter of just
controlling how you're going

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:41.010
along, a kind of controlled
hallucination.
