00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.450
PROF.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.430
PATRICK WINSTON: It's too bad,
in a way, that we can't paint

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.260
everything black, because this
map coloring problem sure

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.410
would be a lot easier.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.930
So I don't know what we're
going to do about that.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.920
How long is this
going to take?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.740
Here's what we're going to do.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.480
We're going to wait till either
all the laptops are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.910
closed, or this program
terminates,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.160
whichever comes first.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.690
So how long is this
going to take?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.590
I actually don't know.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.690
I think it'll take more than the
life time of the universe,

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.700
but I'm not sure.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.730
So let's take a look at
a slightly easier

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.560
map coloring problem.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.290
We'll stop this one and change
the map to something I call

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.340
[? simplicia. ?]

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.780
There's 26 states, one for each
letter in the alphabet.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.930
And what we're going to do is
we're going to do a depth

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.350
first search for a suitable
coloring of this map.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340
We're going to go in order,
A, B, C, D, E. And as I've

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.140
suggested here, at each level
we're going to rotate the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.890
color choices so we don't
over use any one color.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.800
So if we launch this particular
search, this depth

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.830
first attempt to
color this map.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.530
There it goes.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.420
And maybe we should wait
until it terminates.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
Or maybe we should just let it
run and it'll terminate,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.360
perhaps, sometime within
the lecture.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.960
Or maybe we should just let
it run over the weekend.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980
Or how long do you think we
would have to wait, if we want

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.206
to come back and watch
it terminate?

00:01:37.206 --> 00:01:39.250
At roughly 30 frames
a second--

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm calculating it all in my
head, I don't want to bet my

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.530
life on it-- but I think
about 5,000 years.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.330
And if we want to use as many
states as there are in the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.990
United States, in this
demonstration, you get up to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.940
numbers like 10 to
the 17th years--

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270
17th, 18th, 16th, I'm
not exactly sure.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.670
I did a rough calculation.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.100
And, of course, you could do
some parallels into that, and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.020
it's not as bad as chess, where
you need all the atoms

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.358
in the universe and you
still can't do it,

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:10.570
and things like that.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.510
Acting as computers.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.420
But still, it's pretty
horrendous.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.570
The problem is, well the problem
is illustrated by this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.810
diagram I put in back of me.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.950
If you do a depth first
search and you have a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.590
problem like Texas.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.940
Texas has always, always been
a problem, ever since they

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.140
joined the Union.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.330
I could pick on other
states, too.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.310
Kentucky, Tennessee, if you're
from those states you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.630
represent something
even worse.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.700
But Texas is down there.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.980
And the trouble is, if you
assign a color to Arizona,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.730
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and
Louisiana first, and then wait

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.560
around to Texas last, then you
get yourself into a bind by

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.620
your fourth choice, that you
don't discover until you're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.780
48th choice.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.840
So what happens then, is that
you start developing this tree

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.710
like this, you get to those
states surrounding Texas.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.940
Texas is last state assigned
a color and there's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.510
nothing left for it.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.316
And that problem was there on
the fourth choice, and you

00:03:26.316 --> 00:03:28.700
don't discover it until
your 50th choice.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.040
So you develop a horrendous,
impossible, impossible search.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.070
So you simply can't
do it that way.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.270
But now, not to worry.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.400
I've come equipped with
the idea of constraint

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.410
propagation.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.170
So we could just take
a country with four

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.840
states, like this.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.180
Each can be labeled red,
green, blue and yellow.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.080
So just like in a case of line
drawings, we'll pile up all

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.270
the possible things that the
value can be-- red, green,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.740
blue and yellow.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.420
Red, green, blue and yellow.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.460
Red, green, blue and yellow.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.330
And we start up constraint
propagation.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.200
So we say for the upper left
hand corner state, is there

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.329
any reason to believe that
R is impossible?

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.190
Well we look at our neighbors
and see what kind of

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.329
constraint flows in from them.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.070
And sure, this guy could
be green, and this

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.320
guy could be blue.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.060
They don't have to be red,
so there's nothing

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.770
that rules out red.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.310
And there's nothing the
rules out blue.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.250
And there's nothing that
rules out yellow.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.430
And there's nothing that
rules out green.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.422
So constraint propagation just
sits there with its finger up

00:04:40.422 --> 00:04:43.380
its nose, doing nothing.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.630
So it doesn't look like we can
use either depth first search,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.470
or constraint propagation.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.660
So we could just give
up and cry.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.500
But maybe there's some other
approach that will help.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.810
So let me actually work
the Texas problem.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.690
So with apologies to
Houston and Tyler,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.940
here's a map of Texas.

00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:16.595
There we are.

00:05:16.595 --> 00:05:19.660
And here's, roughly
speaking, Arizona

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.530
is over here somewhere.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.220
And we've got Oklahoma
in there.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.440
And old Bill Clinton's
state, Arkansas.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.420
And then Louisiana sticks
out there a little bit.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.700
So there's our map of that

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.170
particular part of the country.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:43.310
So we've got Arizona here,
Oklahoma here, Arkansas here,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.350
and Louisiana here,
and Texas here.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.060
And we have elected to assign
colors to these states, in

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.900
that order.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.090
So this is one, two,
three, four.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.530
And we're going to do that.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.720
We're going to rotate our color
choices, just so we

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.460
don't over use any one color.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.620
But we're going to also have a
look at Texas as we go around.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.930
Because Texas is a state that
borders on the States they

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.740
were choosing colors for.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.050
So the only possible colors that
Texas could be are red,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.510
green, blue, and yellow.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.510
So as we make our choices around
here, we'll say that--

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.540
we don't have to adhere to any
particular style-- we can say

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.800
that Arizona is going to get
the colored red, R. That's

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.240
going to rule out R over here
for Texas, because no adjacent

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.750
states can have the
same color.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.020
Then we go over to Oklahoma, and
we're rotating our color

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.670
choices, so we'll say
that can be green.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.610
And that's fine, because it's
consistent with the red here,

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.190
but it rules out the
possibility that

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.820
Texas could be green.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:10.170
And then we go over here to
Arkansas, red, green, blue.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.460
That's fine, that's consistent
with the green on Oklahoma,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.270
but if we look at its neighbors
we know that Texas

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.580
is forever forbidden
to be blue, now.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.110
So now we go over to Louisiana,
and remember, we're

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.280
rotating our color choices
because we don't want to

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.240
overuse them.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.046
So this means that the first
choice we're going to make

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:30.695
here, for Louisiana,
is yellow.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.380
And that's fine because it's
consistent with Arkansas, but

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.110
it's not so fine because it's
now ruled out the last

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.220
possibility for Texas.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.040
So even though Texas is going
to be the 48th state that we

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.770
color, we're going to say,
at this point, there's no

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.830
need in going on.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.680
We'd better back up.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.920
Because there's nothing left for
Texas when we get around

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.530
to coloring it.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.990
So that means that this yellow
is ruled out here.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.550
This yellow reappears.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.740
We select the next color in my
line for Louisiana, which

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.640
happens to be red.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.310
And now that's consistent
with this yellow that's

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.800
still left for Texas.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.260
And it's also consistent
with the blue

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.270
that's up here for Arkansas.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.210
So that's cool.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.580
I wonder if maybe we could make
an algorithm out of that,

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.980
and solve problems like this.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.860
Do you see, sort of, the
intuition of what we're doing?

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.970
We're actually using the martial
arts principle, again.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.520
Because the whole problem is
that local constraints,

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.600
undiscovered local constraints,
are causing

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.720
downstream problems.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.799
So we're going to use the
enemy's powers against him,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.750
and we're going to look at those
local constraints as we

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.910
go and make sure they're not
going downstream, not going to

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.980
get us later on.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.060
So now I'm going to look like
I'm getting a little formal,

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.890
but I'm just getting a little
bit more formal.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:02.090
Because I want to have some
language that I can use to

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.100
describe what's going on, so
that it's clear what the

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.180
choices are.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.590
So to start off with, we're
going to have to have some

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.310
vocabulary.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.670
So let's start up our
vocabulary here.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:22.000
We're going to have a notion
of a variable v. And that's

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.250
something that can have
an assignment.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.290
There's nothing complicated
about that.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.540
And a value.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.040
A value x is something that
can be in assignment.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.880
It's a little bit circular,
but we're all in computer

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.300
science so you know
what I mean.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.770
So the next thing is a little
slightly less obvious, and

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:11.870
that's the notion
of a domain, d.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.250
And that's going to be
a bag of values.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.520
OK.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.150
So one more thing.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.400
A constraint.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:36.080
That's a constraint
c, is a limit on--

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.670
in our examples it's mostly
going to be pairs of

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.910
variables, pairs of
variable values.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.995
But in general, it could
be variable values.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.040
So if we go back here to Texas
we could say, OK, how does our

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.190
vocabulary drape itself over
that configuration?

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.420
And the answer is, the states
have the role of variables,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.670
the colors have the
role of values.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.780
And the domains are the
remaining color possibilities

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.510
that we can still use on
a particular state.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.770
And the constraint, in this
case, is the simple map

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:20.770
coloring constraint that no
states that share a boundary

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.100
can have the same color.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.840
So states are variables, colors
are values, domains are

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.760
bags of colors, and
constraints--

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.310
there's only one--

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.330
adjacent states can't
have the same color.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.440
So that's how it fits with
this vocabulary.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.800
So now, what did I
actually do here?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.950
Well what I actually did here,
I'm going to now formalize a

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.500
little by writing it down
in pseudo code.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.100
So here we are, we're going to
have a look at what we did

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.630
here with our intuition,
and we're going to

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.700
reduce it to a procedure.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.950
And here's the procedure.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.860
Remember, we're doing depth
first search on this stuff.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.650
I did a depth first search.

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:10.200
We're going to do a depth first
search, and for each

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.580
depth first search
assignment--

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.610
OK, so here I am, I'm labeling
Arizona, and then Oklahoma,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.250
and then Arkansas, and
then Louisiana.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.500
When I give each one of those a
label, a color, I'm going to

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.210
do this procedure.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.495
Every time I make one of
those assignments.

00:12:33.495 --> 00:12:36.640
The last one that caused
trouble was

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.230
coloring Louisiana yellow.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.520
Each time I put one of those
colors down, each time I make

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.070
an assignment, I'm going
to do this procedure.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:56.690
So for each depth first search
assignment, for each variable

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.095
v, considered.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.390
Now you don't know what
I mean by considered.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:12.300
But when I put a label, when I
put up a value, show something

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:17.340
as a color for Louisiana,
I thought about Texas.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.340
So I was considering the
variable, Texas, when I made

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.662
the assignment for Louisiana.

00:13:22.662 --> 00:13:24.890
Now I'm going to be a little bit
vague about what I mean by

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.720
considered, right now.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.500
Because there are lots of
choices about how much stuff

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.240
you actually consider.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.390
So let me just say consider,
and then we'll open that up

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.930
and talk about the options in a
moment, so for each variable

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.560
v considered for--

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.040
let's call that variable
v sub i--

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:53.340
for each x sub i, for each value
in the domain of that

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.760
variable, consider each of the
things that still surviving.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:13.530
For each of those, for each
constraint c, that's between x

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:26.390
sub i, and some x sub j, where
x sub j is an element of the

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:29.050
domain of j.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.020
Now that sounds awfully fancy,
but this just says, in the

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.940
case of Texas up there, whenever
I consider one of the

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:40.170
values that's still remaining as
a choice for Texas, I want

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.700
to consider all of the
constraints between that

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.550
variable and the adjacent
states.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:52.600
And I want to be sure that
anything I leave in the domain

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.350
is OK for some selection in
the other states, some

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.960
remaining choices in
the other states.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.090
So that's why we're getting
pretty nested here.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.540
But we're doing depth
first search.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.740
We are considering the variables
in a certain

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.660
collection of variables.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.160
For each one of those where
considering all the values

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.350
that still remain in the domains
of those variables.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.950
And then for each of those
values, we're checking to see

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.010
if it satisfies this some
constraint, satisfies the

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.280
constraint that are
placed upon it.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.580
So for each of these constraints
if there does not

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:40.910
exist an x sub j, such that, the
constraint between x sub i

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:51.090
and x sub j is satisfied, well
if in that adjacent place

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.770
there's nothing that is
consistent with a value, then

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.380
we've got to get rid of it.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.350
If that's true.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:03.810
If there does not exist some
value in an adjacent variable

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.380
such that that constraint is
satisfied, we're hosed.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.770
We've got to get rid
of that value.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:19.370
So we're going to remove
x sub i from d sub i.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.250
OK.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.070
Now, that's fine.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.730
That's sort of what
I did with Texas.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.610
As soon as I plopped down a
value for Louisiana I said,

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.770
well what are the possible
values in Texas?

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.610
Red, green, blue and yellow.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.620
Let's consider red.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.480
Let's consider the constraints
between Texas and

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.160
all adjacent states.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.660
One of those constraints
says it can't be the

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.660
same color as Arizona.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.690
The only color I've got
available for Arizona, since

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.870
I've already made the
assignment is red.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.580
Red is not consistent with
red, so I've got

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:53.070
to get rid of it.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.080
So it looks complicated, but
it's just intuition.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.780
So what do we do if we get
to a situation where

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.710
the domain is empty?

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.975
That means whenever we get
around to making assignment to

00:17:03.975 --> 00:17:06.560
it, there won't be
anything left.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:21.310
So if that ever happens, if the
domain ever becomes empty,

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.746
then what do we do?

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:23.996
We've got to back up.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.130
So the intuition is clear.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.070
This is the algorithm.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.960
The algorithm when you work
through it, think about

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.360
whether it makes sense
and what not.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.370
How it fits with Texas.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.190
Yeah, it sure does.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:42.160
All we're doing is we're making
these death first

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.710
assignments.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.290
And in the neighborhood of those
depth first assignments

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.980
we're looking around to see if
the values that are possible

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:49.960
include something.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.180
And if they don't include
anything, we know we made and

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.380
irrevocable blunder, and
we have to back up.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.050
So that's the essence
of the idea.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.050
Now, how well does it work?

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:11.570
Well a little bit depends on
what we choose for considered.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.550
There are lots of choices
for what we consider.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.360
So let me enumerate some of
those choices and then we'll

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.710
have a look and see
what they do.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.700
Oh I guess one possibility
is to consider nothing.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.320
Let's try it out.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.470
So our type of search is
going to be no checks.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:01.890
What do you think is
going to happen?

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.910
We're not even checking
the assignment.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.380
That's pretty fast.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.560
Unfortunately, since we haven't
even check the most

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.490
recent assignment, we get lots
of places where there are

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.490
states that are adjacent
to each other that

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.130
have the same color.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.380
That's no good.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.440
So another thing we can do
is consider everything

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.690
everything.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.600
That's no good, because that
would say, as soon as we color

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.020
our first state, we check to
make sure that all 47 other

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.270
states can be colored.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.090
That seems like it over
doing it a little bit.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.795
But in any case, at least we
want to check the assignment.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.230
So if we go back here and check
the assignment, let's

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.480
see what happens.

00:20:11.995 --> 00:20:14.950
Type assignments, assignments
only.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:15.650
Boom.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.580
Aw, gees, that's where I
got in trouble before.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:26.140
This is the thing is going to
run for 17 billion years at

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.330
nanosecond or something
like that.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.630
It's only a billion years if
you run it at nanosecond

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.760
speed, so I guess maybe
you could do that.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.110
Have a fast computer.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.360
But this isn't going to work
because of our unfortunate

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.950
choice of Texas as the last
state to be considered, and

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.690
the unfortunate coloring of the
four surrounding states

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.280
right up front.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.100
And our unfortunate decision to
rotate the color so as to

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.310
avoid overdoing any one color.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.200
So this doesn't work.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.760
We know we went to the trouble
of working out the business

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:03.950
with Texas by hand, using the
domain reduction algorithm.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.470
Better make a note
that this is the

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.740
domain reduction algorithm.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.250
And what we're going to do is
we're going to check the

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.120
neighbors of the assignments.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:21.970
Just like we did here.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.360
We checked Texas each time
we made one of those four

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.050
choices, because it's a neighbor
of all of the choices

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.490
of the states that we made.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.640
So one thing to do is
to check neighbors.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.510
This is one, two, three, now
let's see what happens.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.805
Check neighbors only, go.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.390
Shoot, I don't know.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.560
It's OK with Texas, right?

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.522
Because it didn't color the
states around Texas with all

00:22:20.522 --> 00:22:22.760
of the four color choices.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.770
But it's still getting into
trouble in other places.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.930
Like the states like Missouri,
Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.085
states with lots
of boundaries.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.080
So I don't know whether
this is going to--

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.350
oh, there it finally worked.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.010
It went through a lot
of effort, though.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.540
For the sake of comparison, we
might make a note that it ran

00:22:48.540 --> 00:23:01.250
into 9,139 dead ends.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:02.720
But it did do some good.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:07.200
It didn't take a length of time
longer than the remaining

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.620
part of the universe.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.140
But if it's a good idea to check
the neighbors, if we

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:16.580
make a change to the neighbors,
what might that

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.940
suggests that we
do in addition?

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.680
Well it might suggest that
if we make a change to a

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.790
neighbor, that we check its
neighbors, too, make sure

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.040
they're all right.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.470
So another choice
is to propagate.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.370
So propagate through variables
with reduced domains.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:09.790
Let's see how that works.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.760
Wait a minute.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.210
I must have made a mistake.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.470
Let's try that again.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.930
Oh, maybe we better
slow it down.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.785
All that grey stuff is showing
the limit of the propagation.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:49.790
Man it's, let's see at
four second of 40,

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:55.520
that's about 10 seconds.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.190
Boom.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.340
Not bad.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.130
Zero dead ends.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:01.080
And it was a lot faster.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.854
I didn't happen to notice how
many constraints were checked

00:25:02.854 --> 00:25:06.130
on that other thing, I think
it was around 20,000 or so.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.700
This is a lot less.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.320
So this looks like
a good idea.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.255
But why did I label
it number five?

00:25:14.255 --> 00:25:17.960
Well because there's something
between this and number three.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:32.300
So number four is, through v
with d reduced to one value.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.730
So we're not going to propagate
through all of the

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.750
variables which have their
domains shrunk a little bit.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.610
We're only going to propagate
through those that have the

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:49.520
greater shrinkage, all the way
down to a single value.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.200
So let's see how that
might work.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.860
Anybody want to place any
bets on this one?

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:06.280
Let's see.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.490
We checked 2,623 constraints
last time.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:11.740
Let's see what happens
this time.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.930
You can see that the extent of
the gray is less, because it's

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.440
not propagating so far.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:40.690
And as we breathily await the
answer, I'd say we've found

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:41.505
our winner.

00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:45.000
As this does a couple of dead
ends, but the number of

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.020
constraint checked is
less than 1,000.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.360
So in general, with problems
this, you have all of these

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.690
choices for what you consider.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.320
You don't want to consider
nothing, because then you're

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.450
not honoring your constraints.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:59.320
You'll certainly want to
consider the things you just

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:05.670
made assignments for, because
otherwise you'll construct a

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.910
solution that violates
a constraint.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.190
You don't want to do everything,
because that's

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.050
excessive work.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:20.830
And so checking the neighbors
is a good idea, but it's

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.305
always better in practice.

00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:26.160
In practice, inevitably it's the
case that it's better to

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.440
do some propagation through the

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.000
things that you've changed.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.520
How much propagation?

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.540
It doesn't seem to do much
good to propagate through

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:34.070
things are just changed.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.630
But it does seem to do some good
to propagate through the

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.730
things that have changed
and been

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.590
reduced to a single value.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.400
So as soon as you get a neighbor
of some assignment

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.290
you just made that has its
domain reduced to a single

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.730
value, then you check
its neighbors, too.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.410
So you check the neighbors,
of the neighbors, of the

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.290
neighbors, of the neighbors, on
and on and on, as long as

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.950
you've found a domain
being reduced.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.180
And not only being reduced, but
reduced to a signal value.

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:01.580
All right?

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.230
So that's the demand reduction
algorithm.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.860
And I guarantee you a
problem like that.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.300
And I know you don't know how
to work those problems yet,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.060
because this is a little
bit abstract.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.340
And to work these problems in
the exam setting you need to

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.250
know a little bit about how to
keep track of the variable

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.690
values that remain in
the domain, and

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.310
that sort of thing.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.810
And you'll learn more about that
in your recitations, and

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.780
in this mega recitation,
and in the tutorials.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.240
So we could go home except
that there are few little

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.840
flourishes to deal with here.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:43.210
And those flourishes,
include some dirty,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.520
filthy little secrets.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.830
For example, I've chosen,
as my classroom

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.390
example, to pick on Texas.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.620
And arranged for this
situation to

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.130
be especially ugly.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:01.080
So I could arrange the states
in a different way.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.420
We have highly constrained
states, that have a lot of

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.250
bordering states around them.

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:11.950
And we have other states, like
Maine, up there, that only

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.660
borders on one other state.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.550
So I don't know.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:19.685
Will, what do you think?

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.840
Should we arrange the states for
our death first search in

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.490
the order of least constrained
to most constrained, or most

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.740
constrained to least
constrained?

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.080
In other words, should we
start with Missouri, or

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.730
Tennessee, or Kentucky, or
something like that?

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.254
Or should we start with Maine?

00:29:44.254 --> 00:29:46.206
What do you think?

00:29:46.206 --> 00:29:49.140
You have a 50% chance of getting
it right, just by

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.650
[? looking ?] at points.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.950
WILL: Start with
the most first.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.978
PROF.

00:29:53.978 --> 00:29:54.920
PATRICK WINSTON: He thinks we
should start with the most

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.600
constraint first.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.490
Do we have a volunteer who wants
to suggest that we start

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:02.210
with the least constraint
first?

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:05.570
That's the way I always
work on stuff.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:09.050
I'm working on a book or
something, I have 500 things

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.920
to fix, I'll always choose to
work on the easiest stuff

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.980
first, so that I feel like I'm
making the list a lot smaller.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.400
Leave the hardest
things to last.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.910
But we don't have any volunteers
who want to bet on

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.060
that idea of least
constraint first?

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.700
OK.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.010
Jason wants to suggest that
we should work on least

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.050
constraint first.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.370
Well we have ground
truth, because we

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.620
can just try it out.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.030
I guess we'll stick with
our shrinking to one

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.950
value thing, here.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:46.880
But we will reorder things
so that we have the least

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.130
constrained first.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.900
So right away, we got
a color for Maine.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.430
Maybe we ought to speed
this up a little bit.

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.450
Well, that's a good idea.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:12.020
Jason suggested this and we only
1,732 constraints and we

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.010
had 59 dead ends.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:18.910
So let's try the other way
around, and we'll go back to

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.160
four frames a second.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:34.940
So we're working, kind of from
the middle of the country out,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.330
with this one.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.860
We're going to deal with
Maine, I guess, last.

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.520
Which is better.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:49.640
Too bad, I think it looks
like this is better.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.840
In fact, let's not be so
aggressive with the use of

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:53.950
constraint propagation.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.710
Let's just check the
assignments only.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.060
If we go back to an arrangement
where we have

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.970
least constrained first, and
we'll crank up the speed.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.190
Well actually, we would have
to crank it up pretty big,

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.700
because the states like
Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky,

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.264
they're going to
be like Texas.

00:32:16.264 --> 00:32:18.730
And so were kind of back to
the length of the universe

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:19.420
type problem, here.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.640
With the least constraint
first, and no use of

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.090
constraints, other than to check
the current assignment.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:32.440
So let's stop that, though, and
check the most constrained

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.790
first, assignments only.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.310
I don't know how long's
this going to take.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.150
That's the dirty
little secret.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:46.010
If we had arranged our states
from most constrained to least

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.440
constrained, ordinary depth
first search with none of this

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.840
stuff we talked about today
would work just fine.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.090
All right.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.460
So it's a little
bit like games.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.260
Do you use progressive
deepening, or do

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.500
you use alpha beta?

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.885
And the answer is both.

00:33:04.885 --> 00:33:09.730
You use everything you've got
to deal with the problems.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.410
And depending on the problem,
one or another of the things

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.250
you incorporate into your
approach will work just great,

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.040
if you're lucky.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.035
So now, I promise that this is
useful not only for people who

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:24.755
want to color maps.

00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:25.820
God, who wants to do that?

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.000
We know it can be done
with four colors.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.870
But it's also useful for
doing all kinds of

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.530
resource planning problems.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.900
So I want to show you a resource
planning problem, and

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.810
I want you think about--
while I'm doing it--

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:39.900
think about whether it's
actually analogous to the map

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:40.700
coloring problem.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:42.280
All right?

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.180
So here's the deal.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.950
You have just landed a summer
job with the Jet

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:50.210
Green, a new airline.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:58.560
And Jet Green is a low cost,
no frills, hardly any

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.460
maintenance type of airline.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.730
And they want to fly mostly
between Boston and New York.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.480
Occasionally they want to
fly to Los Angeles.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.880
And they're trying to
get by with the

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.889
smallest number of airplanes.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:15.352
So that's why we have a kind of
resource allocation problem

00:34:15.352 --> 00:34:17.500
with Jet Green.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.889
So I'm going to write
down what their

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:20.350
schedule looks like.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:26.590
They have one flight, F1,
that goes from Boston

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:32.429
to JFK, like so.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.740
It's an early in
the day flight.

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.000
Then they want to have
another one, F2, that

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.290
flies from JFK to Boston.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.489
And then they want to have
another flight a little later

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.610
in the day that flies
from Boston to JFK.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.340
And a little later than that,
they want to have another

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.580
flight that goes from
JFK to Boston.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.230
They're going to start off
mostly as a shuttle airline in

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.670
the beginning.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:13.430
So that's F1, F2, F3, and F4.

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:18.460
And they have a fifth flight,
F5, that goes from Boston to

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.600
Los Angeles, that takes
a long time.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.460
So it looks like this
on the schedule.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.940
Of course we have time
going that way.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.325
So that's Boston to LAX.

00:35:33.836 --> 00:35:39.870
Now your job is to determine if
they can fly this schedule

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.610
with four aircraft?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.065
And naturally you don't want to
over use any one aircraft,

00:35:45.065 --> 00:35:48.080
because you would like to
have even wear on them.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.840
Right?

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.090
So as you make your choices,
you'll rotate the aircraft.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:58.140
So you'll assign to this one
to A1, aircraft number one.

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.160
This one will be A2.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.380
This one will be A3.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.160
And this one will be A4.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.370
And, oops, there's no aircraft
left for the flight to Los

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.240
Angeles, because you
only have four.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.410
So, it's obvious, right?

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.450
This is 100%, exactly, the map
coloring problem, even down to

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.380
the four choices.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:24.050
Because, you have the
constraint, the no single

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:29.300
physical aircraft can fly two
flights at the same time.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.920
Just like no two adjacent
states can

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.820
be colored the same.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:38.025
So there's a no same time
constraint, like so.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.620
So if you were assigning
aircraft to these flights, you

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.040
would get down to F4, the fourth
flight, and you would

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.310
say, well, let's see, this
guy down here can be

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.570
A1, A2, A3, or A4.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.700
But if I choose A4 for that
fourth flight, then there

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.540
would be nothing left
in its domain.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:14.640
So you've thus set the problem
up to be identical to the map

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.540
coloring problem.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.100
And, of course, you can enrich
it with other kinds of

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:19.370
constraints.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.190
So, for example, you
might have--

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.980
this is a not same
time constraint--

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.030
and these, I mean,
this is at JFK.

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.590
And it flies out of JFK, so
maybe you can use the same

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.670
aircraft for those.

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:43.550
But not if they're right up
against each other, because

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.110
you have a minimum
ground time rule.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.030
So there's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.490
And there's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.230
There's a minimum ground
time constraint here.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:05.310
And if these are at the same
city, then you've got to allow

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.520
enough time for them to fly
between the two cities that

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.800
are involved.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.820
So the constraints can get a
little bit more complicated,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.430
but the idea is the same.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.690
So you say to me, I don't
trust you, show me.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.660
OK.

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.620
So let me show you.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.680
Oh, by the way, there's one
more way to make this map

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.930
coloring problem
easier, right?

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:28.330
Let's see.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.770
The arrangement is going to be
alphabetical, the type is

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:37.000
going to be assignments only,
and we know that's a loser.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.650
But not if we use a whole
lot of colors.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.520
So it's the use of four colors
that got us into trouble.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.540
Now that's an aside, but
it'll be coming back

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.500
in a moment or two.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.951
Scheduling, here's
that problem.

00:38:52.951 --> 00:38:55.110
Boom.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.910
You can almost see it working
just like the

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.612
map coloring thing.

00:38:58.612 --> 00:39:01.940
But that's maybe too easy.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.190
Let's do this one.

00:39:06.854 --> 00:39:10.020
See this is just like
[? simplicia. ?]

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.520
We've kind of got a goofy
arrangement here that's

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.790
guaranteed to lose at the bottom
because of choices made

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.700
at the top.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.740
But that's OK.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.370
We can that we can stop this,
and we can change to check

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.440
neighbors only.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.690
And boom, there it goes.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.220
Or alternatively, let me see
if I can do it this way.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.738
Most constrained first, type
will be assignments only.

00:39:38.738 --> 00:39:41.210
Boom.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:42.460
That worked fine, too.

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.260
So you might choose to have
a slightly harder

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.920
problem, like this.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.590
And we can search away.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:00.420
Actually I don't know if this
will complete or not.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.970
This is a randomly generated
example.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.060
But you're going to lose your
summer job if you can't figure

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:08.960
out whether you can
do this, or not.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.210
So what are you going to do?

00:40:13.175 --> 00:40:15.040
[? Elliott, ?] you got any
thoughts about how you're

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.260
going to save your job?

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.850
So here's the question
you've been asked.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:26.380
How many airplanes does
Jet Green need?

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.015
And you decide, well, four
seemed to work before, so

00:40:30.015 --> 00:40:32.020
we'll try four here.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.980
You're not sure if it's going
to terminate or not, I mean,

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.170
in your lifetime, let alone
in your summer job.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.890
[? Elliott, ?] let me
give you a hint.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:46.140
Look at the outline.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:51.643
The outline up here, on the
board, the last item.

00:40:51.643 --> 00:40:52.610
[? ELLIOTT: [INAUDIBLE] ?]

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:52.685
PROF.

00:40:52.685 --> 00:40:53.935
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah,
what's that mean?

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:00.380
What's the maximum number of
airplanes we're going to need?

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.990
Suppose we've got five flights,
what's the maximum

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.040
number of airplanes we
would ever need?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.350
Five.

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:11.020
What's the minimum number
of airplanes we'll need?

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.750
One.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:17.510
So let's try it with a small
number of airplanes and a

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:18.760
large number of airplanes.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.190
So that showed us very
fast that we can't

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:30.440
do it with one airplane.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.866
That showed us very fast we can
do it with ten airplanes.

00:41:43.866 --> 00:41:46.794
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:46.794 --> 00:41:51.680
amount of overlappage
from up [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:51.747
PROF.

00:41:51.747 --> 00:41:52.997
PATRICK WINSTON: Volunteer?

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.140
What are we going to do to find
the actual number, as

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.080
fast as possible.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.110
And at least give our boss a
reasonable answer, even if not

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.230
necessarily the exact
number very fast?

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.630
It's easy, right?

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.840
We're going to start up here
with one computer, and we're

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:14.850
going to start down here
with another computer,

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.930
and see what happens.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.280
So let's see if we can
do it with nine.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.200
Let's see if we can
do it with eight.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:34.100
Let's see if we can
do it with seven.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.600
These take almost zero
time, right?

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.850
Because they're under
constraint.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.130
Wow, that's good, seven.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.810
Let's try six.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.060
Actually let's try two.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.580
It loses fast.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.830
Let's try three.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.120
I don't know.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.440
Maybe if you let it run one long
enough three will work.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.120
I doubt it.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:09.110
While we're at it though, we
might as well go back here and

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:09.790
try it with six.

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.040
Remember seven worked
real fast.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.510
Gees, six, that was
six, right?

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.870
Yeah.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:19.120
So let's try it with five.

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:22.950
OK.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.730
So it runs real fast
with five.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.660
It terminates real quick
with two, so we got

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.710
three and four left.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.955
So we could tell our boss, a
la any time algorithm, that

00:43:33.955 --> 00:43:35.890
you're not real sure, but you
know it's going to be either

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:37.280
three or four.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.270
And then, you got
two computers.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.120
You can let both run and see
if either one terminate.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.730
So you have three and four.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.140
My guess is that three will
eventually give up.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.040
But of course, there's another
little problem here.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.700
We haven't used the most
constraint first.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:56.520
If we did that, we might be
able to do it even faster.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.620
Actually, I don't think I can
make that switch without

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.810
getting another random
assignment, but

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.320
let's see what happens.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.950
Maybe so.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.200
SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:10.266
PROF.

00:44:10.266 --> 00:44:12.000
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, I already
had most constraint first?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.370
OK.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.660
So it didn't help to
actually switch.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.750
And I think I've got a new
schedule to work here.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:21.190
So that's the end
of the story.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.250
You can do good resource
allocation if you do several

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:26.510
things are once.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.450
Number one, you always want to
use most constraint first.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:31.350
Number two you want to propagate
through domains

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.050
produced to a single
algorithm.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.380
And number three, if you really
try to figure out what

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.086
the minimum number of resources
needed is, you do

00:44:39.086 --> 00:44:42.380
this under over business and you
can quickly converge on a

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.550
narrow range where the search is
taking a long time, and be

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.310
sure that it lies within
that narrow range.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.330
Because when you over resource,
it's fast to

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.670
complete, and when you
under resource,

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.180
it's fast to terminate.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.180
So you can just squeeze
it right down into

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.600
a very small range.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.270
And that is the end
of the story.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:03.700
Enjoy your holiday on Monday.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.660
We'll have two classes next week
on Wednesday and Friday,

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.910
as advertised.
