PATRICK WINSTON: Today
we're going to be

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.030
talking about Search.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.220
I know you're going to
turn blue with yet

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.350
another lecture on Search.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.270
Those of you who are taking
computer science subjects,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.360
you've probably seen in 601.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.270
You'll see it again
as theory course.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.570
But we're going to do it for
a little different purpose.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.480
I want you to develop some
intuition about various kinds

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.080
of Search work.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.800
And I want to talk a little bit
about Search as a model of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.080
what goes on in our heads.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.630
And toward the end, if there's
time, I'd like to do a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.660
demonstration for you of
something never before

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.960
demonstrated to a 603.4 class,
because it was only completed

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.600
last spring.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.470
And some finishing touches were
added by me this morning.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.450
Always dangerous, but we'll
see what happens.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.870
There's Cambridge.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.150
You all recognize
it, of course.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.550
You might want to get from some
starting position s to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.280
some goal position g.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.490
So, you'll hire a cab and
hope for the best.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:31.430
So, here's what might
happen, not too hot.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.175
Let's move the starting
position over here.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.245
I've had cab drivers
like this New York.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.460
But it's not a very good path.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.400
It's the path of a thief.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.930
Let's change the way that the
search is done to that of a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.975
beginner, an honest beginner.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.100
Not too bad.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.360
Now, let's have a look at how
the Search would happen if the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
cab driver was a Ph.D.
in physics

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.690
after his third post-doc.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.750
These are not actually
traverse.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.050
These are just things that the
driver is thinking about, and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.840
that is the very best of
all possible paths.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.480
So, the thief does
a horrible job.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.110
The beginner does a pretty
good job, but

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.960
not an optimal job.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.790
This is the optimal job as
produced by the Ph.D. in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.910
physics after his
third post-doc.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.230
So, would you like to understand
how those all work?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.480
The answer, of course, is yes.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.070
I'm going to talk to you about
procedures that are different

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.260
from the way that you just
solved this problem.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.420
I imagine that if I said to you,
please find a path for s

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.020
to g, you would, within
a few seconds, find

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.070
a pretty good path--

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.710
not the optimal one, but
a pretty good one--

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.050
using your eyes.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.940
And we're not going to tell
you about how that works,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.540
because we don't know
how that works.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.030
But we do know that problem
solving with the eyes is an

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.260
important part of our
total intelligence.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.260
And we'll never have a complete
theory of human

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.640
intelligence until we can
understand the contributions

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.990
of the human visual system to
solving everyday problems like

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.470
finding a pretty good
path in that map.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.870
But, alas, we can't talk about
that, because we don't know

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.100
how to do it.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.820
We're working on it.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.450
But we don't know
how to do it.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.880
So, I'm not going to use
Cambridge in my illustrations.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.860
There's too much there to
work through in an hour.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.620
So, we're going to use this map
over here which has been

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.850
designed to illustrate a
few important points.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.520
You, too, can find a path
through that graph pretty

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.570
easily with your eyes.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.320
Our programs don't have eyes,
and they don't have visually

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.280
grounded algorithms, so they're
going to have to do

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.720
something else.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.180
And the very first kind of
search we want to talk about

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.980
is called the British
Museum approach.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.100
This is a slur against at least
the British Museum, if

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.400
not the entire nation, because
the way you do a British

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.230
Museum search is you find
every possible path.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.310
So, it'll be helpful to have a
diagram of all possible paths

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.410
on the board.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.200
We're going to start with
a British Museum search.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.130
From the starting position, it's
clear, you can go from my

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.405
s to either a or b.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.600
And already there's an
important quiz point.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.260
Whenever we have these kinds of
problems on a quiz, we ask

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.720
you to develop the tree
associated with a search in

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.470
lexical order.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.600
So, the nodes there under s
are listed alphabetically,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.710
just to have an orderly
way of doing it.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.830
So, from a we can go
either b or d.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.940
And another convention of the
subject, another thing you

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.530
have to keep in mind in quizzes,
is it we don't have

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.180
these searches bite
their own tail.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.400
So, I could have said that
if I'm at a, I can

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.570
also go back to s.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.730
But no path is ever allowed
them to bite itself, to go

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.190
around and enter and get
back to a place that's

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.580
already on the path.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.750
Now if I go on to b first, that
means that from b I can

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.600
go to either a or c.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.020
This is getting fat
pretty fast.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.570
But let's see, s, a, b.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.930
The only place I can go
is c and then to e.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.360
s, a, d, without biting my own
tail and going back to a, the

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.290
only place I can go is g.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.820
s b, a, I can only go
to d and then to g.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.040
And finally, s, b, c,
I can only go to e.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.190
So, that is a complete set of
paths as produced by any

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.720
program that you will feel you'd
like to write that finds

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.470
all possible paths.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.780
I haven't been very precise
about how to do that, because

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.350
you don't have to be.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.780
You can't save much work by
being clever, because you have

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.570
to find everything.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.440
So, that's the British Museum
expansion of the tree.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.410
So, what have I done?

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.820
I've been playing around
with a map.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.550
I showed you an example
of a map.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.310
And pretty soon you're
going to think that

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.616
Search is about maps.

00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:14.820
So, before going even another
tiny step, I want to emphasize

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.030
that Search is not
equal to maps.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.600
Search is about choice.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.690
And I happen to illustrate
these searches with maps,

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.390
because they are particularly
cogent.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.790
But Search is not about maps.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.800
It's about the choices you make
when you're trying to

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800
make decisions.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.470
These things I'm going to be
talking to you about today are

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.172
choices you make when
you explore the map.

00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:39.630
You can make other kinds of
choices when you're exploring

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.630
other kinds of things.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.500
And, in fact, at the end, if
there's time, I'll show you

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.130
how you do searches when you're
solving problems in a

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.380
humanities class.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.410
That's the British
Museum algorithm.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.950
Search is not about maps.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.240
Our first gold star idea,
Search is about choice.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.660
But for our illustration,
Search is about maps.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.530
So, the first kind of Search we
want to talk about that's

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.460
real is Depth-first Search.

00:08:10.412 --> 00:08:15.500
And the idea of Depth-first
Search is that you barrel

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.070
ahead in a single-minded way.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.832
So, from s, your choices
are a or b.

00:08:27.832 --> 00:08:31.730
And you always go down the left
branch by convention.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.350
So, from s, we go to a.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.919
From a we have two choices.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:46.990
We can go to either b or
d following our lexical

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.630
convention.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.660
After that, we can go to c.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.660
And after that we can go to e.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.871
And too bad for us,
we're stuck.

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.520
What are we going to do.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.790
We've got into a dead
end, all is lost.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.640
But of course, all isn't lost.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.180
Because we have the choice of
backing up to the place where

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.280
we last made a decision and
choosing another branch.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.350
So, that process is called
variously back-up or

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.600
backtracking.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.670
At this point, we would
say, ah, dead end.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.110
The first place we find when we
back up the tree where we

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.070
made a choice is when we
chose b instead of d.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.420
So, we go back up there and
take the other route.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.730
s, a, d now goes to g.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.220
And we're done.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.220
We're going to make up a little
table here of things

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.880
that we can embellish our
basic searches with.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.420
And one of the things we can
embellish our basic searches

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.680
with is this backtracking
idea.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.410
Now, backtrack is not relevant
to the British Museum

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.120
algorithm, because you've
got to find everything.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.000
You can't quit when you've
found one path.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.940
But you'd always want to use
backtracking with Depth-first

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.140
Search, because you may plunge
on down and miss the path that

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.050
gets to the goal.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.480
Now, you might ask me, is
backtracking, therefore,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.330
always part of Depth-first
Search?

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.350
And you can read textbooks
that do it either way.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.190
Count on it.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.500
If we give you a Search problem
on a quiz, we'll tell

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.400
you whether or not your Search
is supposed to use

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.990
backtracking.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.200
We consider it to be
an optional thing.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.320
You'd be pretty stupid not to
use this optional thing when

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.925
you're doing Depth-first
Search.

00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:44.800
But we'll separate these
ideas out and call

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.300
it an optional add-on.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:51.600
so, that's Depth-first
Search, very simple.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.670
Now, the natural companion to
Depth-first Search will be

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:02.454
Breadth-first Search,
Breadth-first.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.620
And the way it works is you
build up this tree level by

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.160
level, and at some point, when
you scan across a level,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.790
you'll find that you've
completed a path

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.100
that goes to the goal.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.310
So, level by level, s can
go to either a or b.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:30.670
a can go either to b or d.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.620
And b can go to either a or c.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.480
So, you see what we're doing.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.030
We're going level by level.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.360
And we haven't hit a level
with a goal in it yet, so

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.510
we've got to keep going.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.800
Note that we're building up
quite a bit of stuff here,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.360
quite a lot of growth in the
size of the path set that

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.540
we're keeping in mind.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.850
At the next level, we have b
going to c, d going to g, a

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.030
going to d, and c going to e.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.460
And now, when we scan
across, we do hit g.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.530
So, we found a path with
Breadth-first Search, just as

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.985
we found a path with
Depth-first Search.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.360
Now, you might say, well,
why didn't you just quit

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.420
when you hit g?

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.340
Implementation detail.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.830
We'll talk about a sample
implementation.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.990
You can write it in
any way you want.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.080
But now that we know what these
searches are, let's

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.560
speed things up a little bit
here and do a couple searches

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.530
that now have names.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.590
The first type will be
Depth-first, boom.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.870
That's the one that produces
the thief path.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.070
And then we can also do a
Breadth-first Search, which we

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.310
haven't tried yet.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.350
What do you suppose is
going to happen?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.030
Is it going to be fast, slow,
produce a good path,

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.840
produce a bad path?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.095
I don't know, let's try it.

00:12:56.095 --> 00:12:58.410
I had to speed it up, you see,
because it's doing an awful

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.670
lot of Search.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.410
It's generating an awful
lot of paths.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.280
Finally, you got a path.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.030
Is it the best path?

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.680
I don't think so.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.700
But we're not going to talk
about optimal paths today.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.730
We're just going to talk
about pretty good

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.330
paths, heuristic paths.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.545
Let's move the starting position
here in the middle.

00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:25.050
Do you think Breadth-first
Search is going to be stupid?

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.310
I think it's going to
be pretty stupid.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.730
Let's see what happens.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.840
This Search is a lot to the
left, which you would never do

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.795
with you eye.

00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:35.050
Let me slow that down just
to demonstrate it.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.190
It finds a shorter path, because
it's right there in

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.470
the middle.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.810
But it spends a lot of its time
looking off to the left.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.740
It's pretty stupid.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.810
But that's how it works.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.760
So, now that we've got two
examples of searches on the

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.460
table, I'd like to just write
a little flow chart for how

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.800
the search might work.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.710
Because if I do that, then it'll
be easier for us to see

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.600
what kind of small differences
there are between the

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.550
implementations of these
various searches.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.500
So, what we're going to do is
we're going to develop a

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.020
waiting list, a queue, a
line, whatever you'd

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:11.180
like to call it.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.380
Let's call if a queue.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.590
We're going to develop a queue
of paths that are under

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.960
consideration.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.120
So, the first step in our
algorithm will be to

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.242
initialize our queue.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.550
And I think what I'll do is
I'll simulate Depth-first

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:37.780
Search on this problem
up there on the

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.500
left using this algorithm.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.890
I need to have some way of
representing my paths.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.960
And what I want to do is I'm
going to betray my heritage as

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.720
a list programmer, because I'm
just going to put these up as

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.320
if there were lisp
s-expressions.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.140
To begin with, I just
have one path.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.710
And it has only one
node in it, s.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.400
That's the whole path.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.890
The next thing I do after I
initialize the queue is I

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:18.415
extend first path
on the queue.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.785
OK, when I extend s,
I get two paths.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:38.670
I get s goes to a, and
I get s goes to b.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.460
I take the first one off
the front of the queue.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.320
And I put back the two
that are produced by

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.070
extending that path.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.130
Now, after I've extended the
first path on the queue, I

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:56.820
have to but those extended
paths on to the queue.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.200
In here there's an explicit step
where I've checked to see

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.620
if that first path
is a winner.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.710
If it's not, I extend it.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.950
And I have to put those
paths onto the queue.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.180
So, I'll say that what
I do is I end queue.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:19.950
Now, I've done one step.

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:21.160
And let's let me do
another step.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.190
I'm going to take this
first path off.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:27.580
I'm going to extend that path.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.760
And where do I put these new
paths on the queue if I'm

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.320
doing Depth-first Search?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.390
Well, I want to work with the
path that I've just generated.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:43.800
I'm taking this plunge down
deep into the search tree.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.290
So, since I want to keep going
down into the stuff that I

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.440
just generated, where then do I
want to put these two paths?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.360
At the end of the queue?

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.430
I don't think so, because
it'll be a long

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.370
time getting there.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.620
I want to put them on the
front of the queue.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:12.859
For Depth-first Search, I
want to put them on the

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.220
front of the queue.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:24.510
And that's why s, a, b goes
here, and s, a, d, and then

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.800
that's s, b.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.100
So, s, b is still there.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.550
That's still a valid
possibility.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.830
But now I've stuck two paths
in front of it, both of the

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.060
ones I generated by taking a
path off the front of the

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.310
queue, discovering that it
doesn't go to the goal,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.130
extending it and putting those
back on the queue.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.210
I might as well complete
this illustration here.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:57.070
While I'm at it, I take the s,
a, b off, s, a, b, and I can

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.840
go only there to c.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.332
But, of course, I keep s, a,
d and s, b on the queue.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.860
Now, I take the front off the
queue again, and I get s, a,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:20.501
b, c, e, and not to forget
s, a, d and s, b.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.340
I take the first one
off the queue.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.900
It doesn't go to the goal.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.000
I try to extend it, but
there's nothing there.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.080
I've reached a dead end.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.670
So, in this operation, all I'm
doing is taking the front one

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.620
off the queue and shortening
the queue.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.860
We're almost home.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.870
I take s, a,d off of queue.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:50.160
And I get s, a, d, c.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.300
And, of course, I
still have s, b.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:19:00.650
Now, the next time I visit the
situation, buried in that

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:04.150
first step, I discover a path
that actually does get to

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.920
goal, and I'm done.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.810
So, each time around I
visualize the queue.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:12.320
I check to see if I'm done.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.840
If not, I take the extensions
and put them

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.606
somewhere on the queue.

00:19:17.606 --> 00:19:25.000
And then I go back in.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.900
And then here there's a varied
test which checks to see if

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.280
we're done.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.650
That's how the Depth-first
Search algorithm works.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.070
And now, would we have to start
all over again if we did

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.780
Breadth-first Search?

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.310
Nope.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.220
Same algorithm.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.110
All the code we've got
needs one line

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.060
replaced, one line changed.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.080
What do I have to do different
in order to get a

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.800
Breadth-first Search out
of this instead of

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.580
a Depth-first Search?

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.440
Tanya?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.930
TANYA: Change [INAUDIBLE]
on the queue.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:57.940
PATRICK WINSTON: And where
do I put it on the queue?

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.840
She says to change it.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.720
TANYA: On the back?

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.030
PATRICK WINSTON: Put
it on the back.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:14.810
So, with Breadth-first Search
all I have to do

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.060
is put on the back.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:28.990
Now, if we were content with a
inefficient search, and didn't

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.350
care much about how good our
path was, we'd be done.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.330
And we could go home.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.690
But we are a little concerned
about the

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.740
efficiency of our search.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.820
And we would like a
pretty good path.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.630
So, we're going to have
to stick around

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.880
for a little while.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.770
Now, you may have noticed, up
there in that the development

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:57.180
of the Breadth-first Search,
that the algorithm is

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.430
incredibly stupid.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.115
Why is the algorithm
incredibly stupid?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.200
Ty, what do you think?

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.189
TY: It can't tell whether it's
getting closer or further away

00:21:09.189 --> 00:21:09.540
from the goal.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.090
PATRICK WINSTON: It certainly
can't tell whether it's

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.330
getting closer or further
away from the goal.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.090
And we're going to deal
with that in a minute.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:17.640
But it's even stupider
than that.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.540
Why is it stupid?

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.474
What's your name?

00:21:22.474 --> 00:21:24.342
DYLAN: Dylan.

00:21:24.342 --> 00:21:26.677
It [? hits ?] the same
nodes twice.

00:21:26.677 --> 00:21:30.340
PATRICK WINSTON: Dylan said it's
extending paths that go

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.660
to the same node
more than once.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:34.970
Let's see what Dylan's
talking about.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.522
Down here, it extends a.

00:21:42.522 --> 00:21:46.810
But it's already extended
a up there.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.440
Down here, it extends a
path that goes to b.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.900
And it's already extended
a path that goes to d.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:02.170
Over here, it could extend a
path that went through c, but

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.800
it's already got a path
that goes through c.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.450
So, all of these paths
are duplicated.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.040
And we're still going
through them.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.450
That's incredibly stupid.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.460
What we're going to do is
we're going to amend our

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.750
algorithm just a little bit.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:31.210
And we're not going to extend
the first path on the queue

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:49.440
unless final node never
before extended.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.380
What we're going to do is we're
going to look to see if

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.780
there-- we've got this path.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.930
And we're going to extend it.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.190
And it's got a final note.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.700
If we've ever extended a path
that goes to that final node,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.580
and it was a final node on
that path, then we're not

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.630
going to do it again.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:16.520
We got to keep a list of places
that have already been

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.506
the last piece of a path
that was extended.

00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:20.830
Everybody got that?

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.130
It's a little awkward to say it,
because it's the last node

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:24.870
we care about.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:30.640
If a path terminates in a node,
and if some other path

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.480
previously terminated in that
node and got extended--

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.570
we're not going to
do it again.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.820
Because it's a waste of time.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.260
Now, let's see if this
actually helps.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.200
Now, use the extended list.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.305
Let's see, well, gee,
we got that place

00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:01.050
in the center there.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.790
Let's just repeat the
previous search.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.200
Wow, it's taking a long time.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.610
But notice it put 103 paths
back on the queue.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:26.200
Now, let's add a filter
and try again.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.640
A lot less.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.950
So, let's speed this up, and
we'll start way over here.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.390
You remember how tedious
that search was.

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:55.240
And now we'll repeat it with
this list, boom, there it is.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.050
That's all because we didn't do
that silly thing of going

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.610
back through the final
node that's

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.170
already been gone through.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.380
So, you would never not
want to do this.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.220
We better list this
as another option.

00:25:19.846 --> 00:25:22.420
It doesn't help with a British
Museum algorithm, because

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.670
nothing helps with the British
Museum algorithm.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:25.950
Does it help with Depth-first?

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:26.800
Yes.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.350
Does it help with
Breadth-first?

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.680
Yes.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.000
Do we do backtracking
with Breadth-first?

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.870
No, because backtracking
can't do us any good.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:43.990
OK, we're almost, except that
search that's starting in the

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.090
middle is still pretty stupid.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:52.200
Both the Breadth-first version
and the Depth-first version

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.940
are going off to the left.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.320
And we would never do that with
our eyes in any case.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.720
The next thing we want to do is
we want to have ourselves a

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:07.020
slightly more informed search
by taking into consideration

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.525
whether we seem to be
getting anywhere.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.550
So, in general, it's a good
thing to get closer to where

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.890
we want to go.

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:24.200
In general, if we've got a
choice of going to a node

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.210
that's close to the goal or a
node that's not so close to

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.830
the goal, we'll always want
to go to the one that's

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.010
close to the goal.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.610
And as soon as we add that to
what we're doing, we have

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:47.290
another kind of Search,
which goes by the

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:48.540
name of Hill Climbing.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.830
And it's just like Depth-first
Search, except instead of

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.540
using lexical order to break
ties, we're going to break

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.290
ties according to which node
is closer to the goal.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.260
I went to some trouble
to talk to you about

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.680
this enqueued list.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.020
And having gone to that
trouble, I'm now

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.860
going to ignore it.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.260
Not because it isn't a good
idea, but because trying to

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.490
keep track of everything
in the example is

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.310
confusing the example.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.350
It won't work out right in the
small example and all that.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.270
Put the queueing thing aside,
queued list aside, and think

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.120
instead just about the value
of going in the direction

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.820
that's getting us closer
to the goal.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.520
In Hill Climbing Search, just
like a Depth-first Search, we

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.790
have a and b.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.800
And we're still going to list
them lexically on underneath

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.636
the parent node.

00:27:47.636 --> 00:27:53.630
But now which one is so
closer to the goal?

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.620
Now, this time b is closer
to the goal than a.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.340
So, instead of following the
Depth-first course, which

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.030
would take us down through a,
we're going to go to the one

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.890
that's closest which
goes through b.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:08.140
And b can either go to a or c.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.040
b is six units away from the
goal. a is about seven plus,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.620
not drawn exactly to scale.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.483
Use the numbers not your eyes.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.740
Now where are we?

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.990
It's symmetric, so a and
c are both equally

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.920
far from the goal.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.220
Now we're going to use
the lexical order

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.160
to break the tie.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:41.510
Now from s, b, a,
we'll go to d.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.190
And now, which is closest
to the goal?

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.340
That's the only choice
we have.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:49.050
So, now we have no choice but
to go down to the goal.

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:53.250
That's the Hill Climbing way
of doing the search.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:54.820
And notice that this time
there's no backtracking.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.270
It's not the optimal path.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:28:59.940
It's not the best path.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.010
But at least there's
no backtracking.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:02.830
That's not always true.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.180
That's just an artifact of
this particular example.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.910
Do you think Hill Climbing would
produce a faster search?

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.030
I think so.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.040
Let's see what happens
when we add these

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.570
things at one at a time.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.790
First, let's turn off
our extended list.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.010
We turned off our
extended list.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.980
And we're going to do
Depth-first again just for the

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.040
sake of comparison.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.460
It produces a very roundabout
path with 48 enqueueings.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.230
Now, let's switch over
to Hill Climbing.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.780
And what do think?

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.630
Do you think it will produce
a straighter path, fewer

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.720
enqueueings?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.970
Boom.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.180
You wouldn't not want to
do that, would you?

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.450
If you've got some kind of
heuristic that tells you that

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.360
you're getting close to the
goal, you should use it.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:03.330
Now, it's easy to modify my
example over there so that

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.550
getting close to the goal
gets you trapped in a

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.690
blind alley on e.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.730
That's easy to do.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.280
But that's just an artifact
of the example.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.130
In general, you want to go along
a path that gets you

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.060
closer to the goal.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.040
So, that's 23.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.400
I don't know, let's see if using
the extended list filter

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.650
does any good.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.360
Yeah, still 23.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:30.670
So, in that particular case
the extension list didn't

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.190
actually do us any good, because
we're driving so

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.440
directly toward the goal.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.740
OK, that's that.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.410
Now, let's see, is there
any analog to--

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:47.580
well, we might say that this
is yet another way of

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.750
distinguishing the searches.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:57.990
And that is, is it an
informed search?

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.540
Is it making use of any kind
of heuristic information?

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:05.640
Certainly, a British Museum
is not, Depth is

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.530
not, Breadth is not.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.980
And now let's consider what
we got for Hill Climbing.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.240
Do we want to use
backtracking?

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.410
Sure.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.010
Do we want to use an
enqueued list?

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.650
Sure.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:18.210
And it is informed, because it's
taking advantage of this

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:18.800
extra information.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.500
It may not be in your problem.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.570
It's not often the case you've
got this information in a map.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.040
Your problem may not have any
heuristic measurement of

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.325
distance to the goal.

00:31:29.325 --> 00:31:31.090
In which case, you
can't do it.

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.980
But if you've got it,
you should use it.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.550
Oh, yeah, there's one more.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:40.020
And I've already given it away
by having it on my chart.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.110
It's called Beam Search.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:46.210
And just as Hill Climbing is
an analog of Depth-first

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:51.770
Search, Beam Search is a
complement or addition of an

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.140
informing heuristic to
Breadth-first Search.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.880
What you do is you start
off just like

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.130
Breadth-first Search.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.230
But you say I'm going to limit
the number of paths I'm going

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.550
to consider at any level to
some small, fixed number,

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.530
like, in this case,
how about two.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.970
So, I'm going to say that
I have a Beam of

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.080
two for my Beam Search.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.080
Otherwise, I proceed just
like Breadth-first

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.330
Search, b, d, a, g.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.880
And now I've got that stupid
thing where I'm duplicating my

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.110
nodes, because I'm forgetting
about the enqueued list.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.760
But to illustrate Beam Search,
what about I'm going to do now

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.080
is I'm going to take all these
paths I've got at the second

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.190
level, and I'm only going
to keep the best two.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.130
That's my beam width.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.220
And the best two are the two
that get closest to the goal.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.430
So, those four, b, c, a,
and d, which two get

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.945
closest to the goal?

00:32:59.945 --> 00:33:02.160
Now, b and d.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.530
These guys are trimmed off.

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:08.030
I'm only keeping two
at every level.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:11.690
Now, going down from b and
d, I have, at the next

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.250
level, c and g.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.860
And now I've found the goal.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.790
So, I'm done.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.040
We could do that here, too.

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:32.350
We could choose a Beam
Search, not bad.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.940
Let's see, let's try this
thing from the middle.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:37.530
Let's slow my speed
down a little bit.

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.853
Now, are we going to see
anything going off to the left

00:33:39.853 --> 00:33:44.950
like we did with ordinary
Breadth-first Search?

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.640
No, because it's smart.

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.780
It doesn't say, I want to go to
a place that's further away

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.030
from my goal.

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.940
Now, let's see, maybe we can go
back to our algorithm now

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:07.620
and talk about that enqueueing
mechanism and

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.870
talk about Hill Climbing.

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.060
Can I use the same basic search
mechanism, just change

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.199
that one line again?

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.570
Yes.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:27.199
How do I add new paths to
the queue this time?

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:29.210
Well, it's very much like
Hill Climbing, right?

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.880
I want to add them
to the front but

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.960
with one little flourish.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.210
What's the flourish?

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.460
[? Krishna, ?] what
do you think?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.500
Remember, I want to use my
heuristic information.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.900
So, I not only add them to the
front, but amongst the ones

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.705
I'm adding to the front,
what do I do?

00:34:43.705 --> 00:34:44.980
AUDIENCE:Check the distance?

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:45.850
PATRICK WINSTON: Check
the distance.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.120
And how do you arrange them?

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:47.958
AUDIENCE:[? You ?]

00:34:47.958 --> 00:34:49.219
[? keep the ?] minimum
[? first. ?]

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.570
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, you
can put the minimum

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.290
first if you like.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.739
But let's sort them.

00:34:53.739 --> 00:34:56.520
We'll sort them, that will
keep everything straight.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.060
So Hill Climbing is
front-sorted.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.580
And, finally, how about Beam?

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.860
What do we do with Beam Search
to add them to the queue?

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.175
Well, it doesn't matter where we
add them, because all we're

00:35:21.175 --> 00:35:25.840
going to do is we're going
to keep the w best.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.270
So, with Beam, we'll just
abbreviate that by

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:35.070
saying keep w best.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.870
Now, you have some of the basic

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.450
searches in you're toolkit.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.800
There's one more that's
sometimes talked about.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.710
We've got Depth, Breadth, Best,
and Beam, one more is

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.720
Best, Best-first Search.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:04.250
It's a variant where you say,
I've got this tree.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.270
It's got a bunch of paths that
terminate in leaves.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:10.510
Let me just always work on
the leaf node that's

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:12.790
closest to the goal.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.510
It can skip around a little bit
from one place to another.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.490
Because as it pursues one path,
it may not do very well

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:20.350
in some other path
quite distant.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.870
And the tree will become
the best one.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.930
We've actually seen an instance
of that in then

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.690
integration program.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:32.840
It's capable of skipping all
over the place, because it's

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.950
always taking the easiest
problem in the search tree, in

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.940
the and/or tree, working
on that.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:43.300
That's Best-first Search.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.340
You can do these sorts
of things in

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.780
continuous spaces, too.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.830
And you've done the
mathematics of

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.580
that in 1802 or something.

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.190
But in continuous spaces, the
Hill Climbing sometimes leads

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.470
to problems or doesn't
do very well.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:04.140
What kind of a problem can you
encounter in a continuous

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.210
space with Hill Climbing?

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.726
Well, how would you do
Hill Climbing in

00:37:11.726 --> 00:37:12.840
a continuous space?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.550
Let's say we're in the
mountains, and a big

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.500
fog has come up.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.470
We're trying to get to the
top of the hill before

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.720
we freeze to death.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:28.006
And we take a few steps north,
a few steps east, west, and

00:37:28.006 --> 00:37:30.380
south using our compass.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.510
And we check to see which
direction seems to be doing

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:37.220
the best job of getting
us moving upward.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.140
And that's our Hill Climbing
approach, right?

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.700
We have explored four directions
we can go and pick

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.180
the best one.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.940
And from there, we pick four,
try all those, pick the best

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.800
one, and away we go.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.180
We've got ourselves a Hill
Climbing algorithm.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.210
What's wrong with it?

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.710
Or what can be wrong with it?

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.840
Sometimes it works just fine.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.330
Yes.

00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.605
SPEAKER 1: You might get stuck
in a local maximum.

00:37:59.605 --> 00:38:02.320
PATRICK WINSTON: We might get
stuck in a local maximum.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:10.590
So, problem letter a is that if
this is your space, it may

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.450
look like that.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.640
And you may get stuck
on a local maximum.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.330
Is there any other kind of
problem that can come up?

00:38:26.215 --> 00:38:28.820
Well, it all depends on what
the space is like.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.645
Here's a problem where the
space has local maxima.

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.010
Now, a lot of people have
been killed on Mt.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.000
Washington when the
fog comes up.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.270
And they do freeze
to death, why?

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.440
The reason they freeze to death
is the Hill Climbing

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.080
fails them, and they can't
get to the top

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.960
to the ranger station.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.660
And the reason is that there
are large lawns on the

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.230
shoulders of Mt.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.580
Washington.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.140
It's quite flat.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.555
So, it's the telephone
pole problem.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:06.120
That space looks like this.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.040
Well, this isn't what Mt.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.910
Washington looks like.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.620
But it's the telephone
pole problem.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:14.370
So, when you're wandering
around here, the idea of

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:17.720
trying a few directions and
picking the one that's best

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.210
doesn't help any, because
it's flat.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:23.090
That can be a problem
with Hill Climbing.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:26.160
Now, there's one more problem
with Hill Climbing that most

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.000
people don't know about.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.253
But it works like this.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.210
This is a particularly
acute problem in

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.280
high dimensional spaces.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.110
I'll illustrate it
here just in two.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:44.370
And I'm going to switch from
a regular kind of view to a

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:46.570
contour map.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:54.950
So, my contour map is going to
betray the presence of a sharp

00:39:54.950 --> 00:40:04.050
bridge along the
45 degree line.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.500
Now you see how you can
get in trouble there.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.280
You get in trouble, because
if you take a step in each

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.350
direction, every direction
takes you downhill.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.610
And you think you're
at the top.

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.826
So, suppose you're right
here and you go north.

00:40:19.826 --> 00:40:24.180
That takes you down over
a contour line.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.550
If you go south, that
also takes you down

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.000
over contour lines.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.870
Likewise, going west and east
all appear to be taking you

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:38.015
down, whereas, in fact, you're
climbing a ridge.

00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:42.270
And that contour line is the
highest that I've shown.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.900
So, sometimes you
can get fooled--

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.000
not stuck, but fooled-- into
thinking you're at the top

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.250
when you're actually not.

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:54.410
Now, this is a model
something.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.130
This subject is about modeling
intelligence.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:01.680
And this is a kind of algorithm
you frequently need

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:04.580
in order to build an
intelligent system.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.360
But do we have any kind of
Search happening in our heads?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.820
If we're going to model what
goes on inside our heads, do

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:19.850
we have to model any kind of
searching in order to do the

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:24.010
kinds of things that
we humans do?

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:24.720
I suppose so.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:28.250
Anytime we make a plan, we're
actually evaluating a bunch of

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.340
choices and seeing
how they work.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.020
Let me see if I can illustrate
it another way.

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:42.260
This is a system that I showed
you a little bit of last time.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.590
And, shoot, I might as well
review one or two things here.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.640
I showed you a Macbeth story.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.220
This is the story
I showed you.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:59.500
And if you had this in a
humanities class, the simplest

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.620
questions that might be asked
is why did Macduff kill

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:08.240
Macbeth down there
at the bottom?

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.960
Did I demonstrate the answering
of questions last

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.340
time, or just the development
of the graph?

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.000
I can't remember.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.210
But we'll do it again, anyway.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.895
This is somewhat stylized
English.

00:42:19.895 --> 00:42:22.570
Just so you'll know,
it doesn't have

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:23.660
to be stylized English.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:27.330
This is English that's made
available to the Genesis

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:31.950
system by way of something
called Story Workbench.

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.800
There's no free lunch.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.740
Either you can use your human
resources to rewrite the plot

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.540
in third grade English.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.940
Or you can use your human
resources to take a more

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.240
natural, adult-type version of
the story and decorate it with

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.510
annotations that make it
possible to absorb it.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.970
Just this summer, in a miracle
of summer [? Europe, ?]

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.313
[? Brit ?]

00:42:50.313 --> 00:42:50.656
[? van ?]

00:42:50.656 --> 00:42:51.280
[? Zijp-- ?]

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.790
one of you--

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.630
connected these two
systems together.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.030
So, we can now work with stories
that are expressed in

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.140
pretty natural English.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.890
Everything in our system is
expressed in English,

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.230
including common sense
knowledge--

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:06.810
like if somebody kills
you, you're dead--

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.880
but more importantly, for
today's illustration, that

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.920
reflective level knowledge,
that knowledge about what

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.180
revenge is.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:17.790
Here you are.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.280
You're in the humanities class,
and someone says,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:21.800
what's really going
on in the story?

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.420
Not the details of who
kills whom, but is

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.560
there a Pyrrhic victory?

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.140
Does somebody have a success?

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.120
Is there an act of revenge?

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.380
These are all kinds of things
you might be asked about in

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:34.800
some kind of humanities class.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.810
So, let me fire up the
genesis system.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.400
Pray for internet
connectivity.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.850
Launch the system on a read of
that Macbeth story that I

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.110
showed you just a moment ago.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.220
At the moment, it's absorbing
information about background

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.960
knowledge, and about reflective
level knowledge,

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.210
and all that sort of thing.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.010
It's building itself
this thing we call

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.100
an elaboration graph.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.320
It's not quite there yet.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.570
It's still reading background
knowledge.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.140
Now it's reading Macbeth.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:36.100
It's building it's elaboration
graph, the same thing you saw

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.060
last time, except not quite.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.570
Do you see that stuff
down at the bottom?

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.500
Those are higher level concepts
that it's managed to

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.930
find in the Macbeth story.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.180
So, its found a revenge.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.510
How did it do that?

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.560
It searched.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.810
It had a description of what a
revenge is, and it looked to

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.270
see if that pattern
was exhibited in

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:03.420
the elaboration graph.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.940
So, in a combination of things
that were said explicitly and

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.650
things that were produced by
knee-jerk if/then rules, the

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.280
elaboration graph was
sufficiently instantiated that

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.580
the revenge pattern
could be found.

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:19.030
That's interesting, Pyrrhic
victory is a little harder.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:21.070
You'd probably get an a if you
said, oh, there's a Pyrrhic

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.220
victory in here.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.320
There it is.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.750
So, I'll blow that up a
little bit so you can

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.870
see what that is.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:32.220
You know what a Pyrrhic
victory is.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.190
It's a situation where
everything seems to be going

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:41.910
good at first, and
then not so hot.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:46.580
So, Macbeth wants to
be King down here.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.975
And eventually that leads
to becoming King.

00:45:48.975 --> 00:45:51.610
But too bad for Macbeth, because
eventually he gets

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:52.540
killed in consequence.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.650
So, it's a Pyrrhic victory.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.580
All that produced by Search
programs who are looking

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.670
through this graph.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.030
Now once you've got the
capability of doing that, of

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.470
course, then you can find
all sorts of things.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:05.820
And you can report
them in English.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.510
But, more interestingly, you
can answer questions.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:12.060
Why did Macbeth--

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.520
it cares not a hoot about
capitalization.

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.160
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: On a
common sense level, it looks

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.690
like Dr. Jekyll thinks Macduff
killed Macbeth because Macbeth

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:26.520
angered Macduff on a
reflective level.

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.200
It looks like Dr. Jekyll thinks
Macduff killed Macbeth

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.720
as part of acts of mistake,
Pyrrhic victory, and revenge.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.410
PATRICK WINSTON: Pretty
corny speech output.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.620
But you see the point.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:40.726
How did it get the stuff on
the common sense level?

00:46:40.726 --> 00:46:43.420
The same way all those programs
that build goal trees

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.600
report, answers the questions.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.687
It's just looking locally around
in the connections in

00:46:48.687 --> 00:46:50.410
the goal tree.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:52.880
How did it get the stuff on
the reflective level?

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:59.240
By reporting on the searches
that produced information--

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.670
it does that by looking for
higher level thoughts about

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.540
its own thoughts and reporting
in which of those higher level

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:12.995
thoughts the incident we asked
about actually occurs.

00:47:12.995 --> 00:47:17.020
So, let's see, just for fun, we
might be interested in why

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.660
Macbeth murdered Duncan.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.600
Wouldn't this be handy if you
hadn't actually read the play,

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.276
and here it is, you've got
to write that paper?

00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:26.400
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
On a common sense

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.790
level, it looks like--

00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:29.150
PATRICK WINSTON: I'll pull the
plug on that, because that's

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.400
just annoying.

00:47:32.768 --> 00:47:36.340
Yeah, pretty good, Macbeth wants
to be King, and Duncan

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:37.620
is the King.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.740
Let's see, why did Macbeth
become King?

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:53.450
Oh, it won't answer
the question

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.700
unless I spell it right.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.990
I wouldn't be able to show that
to you until last spring.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:07.480
In fact, I wouldn't have been
able to show you this today

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.760
until last week with a
tweak this morning.

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.090
Because we've just now connected
the language output

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:17.910
to, of course, [? Cass's ?]

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.910
parser system, which is running
in reverse, in order

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:21.040
to generate that English.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.660
So, that's something that has
never before been seen by any

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.830
eyes but me.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.650
So, that will conclude what
we have to do today.
