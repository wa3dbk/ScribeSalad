MARK SEIFTER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.510
A few of you may know
me from my tutorial,

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.250
but if you don't I'm Mark
Seifter I'm the senior TA here

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.370
at 6034 and these Friday
omega recitations are going

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.606
to be a little bit
different than any

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.980
of the other things
in the class.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.990
All right, so, what
is omega recitation.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.630
Omega recitation is in
this lecture style room,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.230
but I hope to make it more
like a recitation or a tutorial

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.310
by, unfortunately
for some of you,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.740
perhaps, calling on you guys
to participate during the omega

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.110
recitation, as we attempt to
work with some of the material

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.930
that Patrick has given
us the big picture

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.970
for in the lectures.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.700
And if you've gone
to recitation so far

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.400
you may received a
little bit of enrichment

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.230
into how the algorithms work.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.130
Well, here in omega
recitation we're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.810
going to figure out how you
can work the algorithms.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.070
And that's very important,
because in this class being

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.120
able to work the algorithms by
hand in some of these examples

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.430
I put up here, or
like Patrick sometimes

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.950
does in lectures to
teach you the algorithms,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.500
is a crucial way
of demonstrating

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.590
that you understand how the
algorithms work, and we use it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.880
on a quiz.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.690
The way we use it on
the quiz is we-- well

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.110
this is an old quiz problem.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.040
It's from last year.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.480
It tripped up a lot of people.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.490
So we're going to
go over it today.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.120
I'm going to tell you all
the tricks that tripped up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.820
a lot of people, in addition
to emphasizing tricks

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.720
that I've picked up over of
the three years of TA-ing

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.650
this course before, so
that you will not fall prey

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.600
to any of these tricks.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.520
Hopefully.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.900
I say hopefully, because
some of these tricks

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.029
I talked about omega
recitation last year

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.570
and people still
got tricked by them.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.100
I guess maybe some people
didn't come to omega recitation

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.820
or they were just
very tricky tricks.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.040
So be sure to come
to omega recitation.

00:02:16.944 --> 00:02:18.110
Pay attention to the tricks.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.130
Pay attention to how
these things are solved.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.220
Ask questions if
you're not sure.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.010
And when we get
done with the hour

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.350
together I'm hoping
that everyone's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.820
going to do really well on the
rules part of the first quiz.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.510
So without further
ado, if there are

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.730
no questions on that, which
I don't think there probably

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.260
will be, let's move on
to the problem at hand.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.980
As some of you may
have noticed, it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.520
is a Harry Potter based problem.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.430
One of our TAs last year
was a big Harry Potter fan.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.290
So what we have here
a series of rules

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.740
and a series of assertions.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.850
Now if you happen to be real go
getter and have already looked

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.610
at all the past
quizzes online, you

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.640
may have already
seen this problem.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.310
And if you really, really
have attention to detail

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.740
you may notice something a
little bit different in the way

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.700
I wrote it as compared to the
way it was written online.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.140
In fact, you may, if you
have a lot of times a detail,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.710
but you're not really
in on Scheme or LISP,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.680
you may think the way I wrote
it is much easier to understand.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.260
And in case you can't
understand the other way,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.440
and in case one
of the TAs decides

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.900
to write it in a LISP-like
way again, let me explain.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.270
If you look at one of my
rules, say if x is ambitious,

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.880
and x is a squib,
then x has a bad term.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.530
That's rule 0 up at the top.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.270
That's written in sort of what
we call in fixed notation.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.610
It's easy, it's simple.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.160
All operators are in the
order you would expect.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.950
2 plus 3 equals 5.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.220
There's another kind of
notation that is sometimes

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.630
used on previous quizzes.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.720
And by sometimes, good
number of times, actually.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.420
I'm not sure why we still use
it that way, because of the fact

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.810
that the class has move on to
Python, but we do, sometimes.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.480
And that's called
prefix notation.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.510
In prefix notation, the
operator comes first.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.580
So for instance,
plus 2 3 equals 5.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.547
The plus comes first.

00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:15.880
The function, then, comes first.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.050
In this case, the
function is plus.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.680
So if we were writing this
in prefix notation, in fact,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.150
the way I received it, when it
said, "if and x is ambitious,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.760
x is a squib, then
x has a bad term.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.620
The and went first and
there's a parentheses

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.144
which included everything
that was scoped under the and.

00:04:35.144 --> 00:04:37.310
Does anyone have any questions
about prefix notation

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.640
in case it comes up?

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.160
Just remember, if things
start being written

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.270
in a really weird way
with lots and lots

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.740
and lots of
parentheses, whatever's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.705
outside the parentheses,
whether it be "plus" or "and"

00:04:50.705 --> 00:04:55.192
or "or" is an operator that acts
on the things that are inside.

00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:57.150
However, we're not going
to deal with that now,

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.050
because I think the
most important thing is

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.930
to understand is the rules,
and the less important thing

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.030
is to understand
prefix notation.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.100
And you can do a
problem at home that's

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.570
written in prefix notation
to test yourself on that.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.270
So what rules do we have here.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.510
We've got equals 0 through 5.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.720
For some reason they
are labeled with P's.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.420
They are often labeled
with either P's or R's.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.930
The secret on why they are
labelled with P's is that one

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.062
year somebody labeled them
with P's for like "proposition"

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:29.020
or something like that.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.410
And then other TAs looked at
that test and sometimes also

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.320
labeled it with P's and it
sort of down the line continued

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.050
to be labeled with P's,
and sometimes with R's.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.500
So these P's are
these six rules.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.820
The first rule is if x is
ambitious, and x is a squib,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.090
then x has a bad term.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.860
So what's the deal with
these question mark x's?

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.800
The question mark before an
x, or perhaps a y down here,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.340
indicate that there's a
variable waiting to be bound.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.920
We're not assuming there's a
Harry Potter character named

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.130
x, and only if that question
mark x, the mystery character,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.220
only if mystery x character
is ambitious can that person

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.710
possibly have a bad term.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.470
What we're seeing is any
character in the Harry Potter

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.240
universe, or not
the Harry Potter

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.520
universe, maybe a rhinoceros,
can fit into that x.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.850
So for instance, if a
rhinoceros is ambitious,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.920
and a rhinoceros is a squib,
then a rhinoceros has bad term.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.250
That rule saying, for
any x this is true.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.950
And it's very important how
we treat the question mark

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.620
x, and how we bind
question mark x,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.540
when we do both back chaining
and forward chaining.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.820
I'll get back to that, because
some people made some very,

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.720
very small mistakes
that really messed up

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.130
a lot of their forward and
backward chaining last year.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.296
It was actually very tricky.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:56.240
Jeremy, the TA who wrote
this was very clever,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.500
and it makes it really great
case study for you guys.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.125
All right, so Rule 1, if x
lives in Gryffindor tower

00:07:03.125 --> 00:07:05.140
then x is a protagonist.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.750
By the way, for
conciseness I'm going

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.390
to be using GT for
Gryffindor tower

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.530
when I write these
in later on, and I'll

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.920
use SD for Slytherin dungeon.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.460
Speaking of which, Rule 2, if
x lives in Slytherin dungeon,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.960
then x is a villain,
x is ambitious.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.040
Why there are two things here?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.570
Well, after the "if" we have
what we call antecedent,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.580
that's something that needs to
be true in order for this rule

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.030
to match.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.600
After the "then" we have what
is called the consequent,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.509
and in this case there
are two consequents.

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:39.050
Anyone who lives in
Slytherin dungeon

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.440
is automatically a villain
and also ambitious.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.330
So you can think of there
being sort of an "and

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.730
therefore" for the purposes
of both of those assertions

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.520
would be added to
the knowledge base.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.320
Rule 3, if x is the
protagonist or x is a villain,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.730
and x is ambitious,
then x studies a lot.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:09.440
By the way, the scope
for this, just to be sure

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.610
that we're clear, is this.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.470
So we need them to
be a protagonist

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.930
or villain and no matter what
they have to be ambitious.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.460
Rule 4, if x studies a lot,
and x is a protagonist,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.540
x becomes Hermione's friend.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.950
And Rule 5, if x snogs y, and x
lives in Gryffindor tower and y

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.130
lives in Slytherin dungeon,
then x has a bad term.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.760
So those are our
six rules that we

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.330
can use to understand Jeremy's
world of the Harry Potter

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.730
universe.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.060
And we also start off
with four assertions.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.210
Let me not underestimate
the value of always looking

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.960
to the assertions.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.180
It's one of my white star ideas
that are up here on the board.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.740
Let me see.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.240
This.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.270
Perfect.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.640
Always check the assertions
before using a rule.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.260
This really tripped people up
last year, and you'll see why,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.734
because we're doing
last year's problem.

00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:10.150
Our four assertions
that we start.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:14.200
With assertion 0, Millicent
lives in Slytherin dungeon.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.980
Assertion 1, Millicent
is ambitious.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.580
Assertion 1 is what
tripped people up,

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.820
so remember that
Millicent is ambitious.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.690
Assertion 2 Seamus lives
in Gryffindor tower.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.380
And assertion 3,
Seamus snogs Millicent.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.010
So those those are
our four assertions

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.820
that we've already started with.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.020
Now the two things we're
going to have to do

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.400
are backward chaining
and forward chaining.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.657
Now when you guys learned
these two backward chaining

00:09:41.657 --> 00:09:43.840
and forward chaining,
raise your hand

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.500
if thought forward chaining was
harder than backward chaining.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.032
I knew it!

00:09:51.032 --> 00:09:52.990
I can prove whatever
point I want because noone

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:54.320
wants the raise their hand.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.710
I also think backward chaining
is higher than forward

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.210
chaining.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.251
Raise your hand if you
think backward chaining is

00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:00.680
higher than forward chaining?

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.190
First of all, we have a
good number of people.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.580
Second of all, since no one
wants to raise their hand,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.050
I could just ask
it the other way.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.510
That's a pro tip if you're ever
with a large group of people.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.680
You can prove any point you want
by asking the other direction.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.100
No one will raise their hand.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.370
So I agree that backward
chaining is higher than forward

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:18.970
chaining.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.680
And I disagree with Patrick that
we're going to get out early,

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.169
so let's start with
backward chaining first.

00:10:25.169 --> 00:10:27.460
So that we make sure that we
spend the bulk of our time

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:27.959
with it.

00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:31.580
The forward chaining,
well, you just

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.710
go through pretty methodically
and add new rules.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.660
Backward chaining, you have
to draw this crazy tree.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.880
There's a lot of places to get
lost in the middle of the road.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.220
So let's do some
backward chaining.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.540
And to do that, I'll do it
over here on the left side.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.880
So when we're doing
backward chaining,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.470
we have to remember a few
things that are written directly

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.140
on the quiz.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.140
So you're not going to
have to worry about that.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.290
But they're still
pretty important.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.460
So-- actually, I'll
write it on here first.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.470
I'm going to read them off.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.850
So when working on a
hypothesis, the backward chainer

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.510
tries to find a
matching assertion

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.050
in the list of assertions first.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.850
If no matching
assertion is found,

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:13.880
the backward chainer
will try to find a rule

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.250
with a matching consequence.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.460
A rule that has something
in the then that

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.220
can prove the assertion
is trying to figure out.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.920
So for instance, if
I was doing backward

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.140
chaining on Seamus [? Snaus ?]
Millicent, what happens?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.960
I'm immediately
done because there's

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.680
an assertion that's
assertion three that says

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.280
Seamus [? Snaus ?] Millicent.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.180
I proved it.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.920
I'm done.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.530
I'm happy.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.240
We can leave, we can go home.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.380
Unfortunately, that's not
what the quiz asks us to do.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.080
Now, let's say that instead,
we were supposed to say,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.850
I don't know, Seamus
is a protagonist.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.890
Well then, we'd wind
up looking through here

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:54.170
and we would look at the
fact that rule one can prove

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.150
that someone is a protagonist.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.490
And we'd curse and
try to prove whatever

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.650
is in the antecedent of rule
one, which is, OK, well,

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.360
does he live in
Gryffinder Tower?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.420
Assertion two, he does.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.621
So that's some really quick.

00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:09.550
And if that was too,
fast don't worry.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.360
We're going to go step by
step with the actual problem.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.826
But I just wanted to give two
really easy problems, really

00:12:15.826 --> 00:12:17.200
quickly, how it's
going to do it.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.730
Let's go step by step
with the real problem.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.230
Let's keep in mind,
backward chainer

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.360
never adds new assertions
to the list of assertions.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.470
And if you have a
tiebreak, you always

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.080
order based on rule order
first, P0 through P5.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:39.130
And if the same rule matches
with more than one thing

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.030
in your list
assertions, then you

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:44.860
tiebreak based on the
order of the assertions.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.200
Very important.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.560
Disambiguation and
tie-breaking are a big place

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.970
to get messed up.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:56.330
So we're going to try
to prove that Millicent

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.490
becomes Hermione's friend.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.110
And so I'm going to
abbreviate some of the things,

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.750
but not for the very first line.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:13.360
So Millicent becomes
Hermione's friend.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.990
We start drawing a goal tree.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:21.580
Now you guys are going to learn
exactly what these mean very

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.370
soon, in fact, next lecture.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.620
But for now, trust me when I
say these goal trees are depth

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.120
first.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.150
And I'll explain what that
means because some people have

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.070
messed themselves up and spent
more time than they needed to

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:41.190
by treating the goal
tree in a different way.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.950
Now, Millicent becomes
Hermione's friend.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.110
Let's pretend that we
are the backward chainer.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.640
We're trying to prove that
this is true or disprove

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.470
and say, well, it's definitely
not true with what we have.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.290
So let's see.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.260
I'm now going to
make you guys help.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.560
And people in the back think
they won't be called on.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.160
So I often like to call
on people in the back.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.380
What do you think is the
first thing we should do?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.070
Very first thing?

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.820
Yes, look for a
matching assertion.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.020
Excellent.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.030
Do we have a matching
assertion, everyone?

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.860
No, we don't.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.220
That would be the world's
easiest quiz problem.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.790
We do not have a
matching assertion.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.600
Great.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.470
So, since we don't have a
matching assertion, what now?

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.565
AUDIENCE: We start
to look at the rules.

00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:24.690
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:29.060
And do you see any rule that
could prove that Millicent

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.220
becomes Hermione's friend?

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.245
AUDIENCE: P4.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:32.370
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.520
You can see in P4, x,
which can be anybody.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.620
Anyone is capable of
being Hermione's friend.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.310
Great.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:44.210
So P4 is our rule of the hour.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.300
So we're going to use P4.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.760
And when we use P4 to prove that
Millicent becomes Hermione's

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.330
friend, we're going to
have to add something

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.720
or another to the goal tree.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.824
So let's see.

00:14:57.824 --> 00:14:59.490
What do we have to
add to the goal tree?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.301
AUDIENCE: We have
to see if Millicent

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:04.385
studies a lot [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:04.385 --> 00:15:05.509
MARK SEIFTER: That's right.

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:06.470
Does everyone see that?

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.350
In order for her to
become Hermione's friend,

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.676
by rule four, we have to
see if she studies a lot

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:11.550
and is a protagonist.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.373
Question?

00:15:12.373 --> 00:15:13.248
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.830
MARK SEIFTER: OK, that's
a very good question.

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.330
You're going to get screwed up
if you look at the antecedent

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.190
in backward chaining first.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.170
It's backwards
partially for a reason.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.950
You need to look
at the consequent.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.040
Now why is that?

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.550
Well, let's say there
is a rule six that

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:37.310
said if x becomes
Hermione's friend,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:43.090
then Hermione feeds x Polyjuice
Potion, or something like that.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.150
Will that rule help
us in back chaining

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.072
to figure out if Millicent
becomes Hermione's friend?

00:15:49.072 --> 00:15:51.229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:51.229 --> 00:15:53.270
MARK SEIFTER: Some people
are shaking their head.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.760
But think about it, will that
rule be able to prove it?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.280
No.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.120
Now, if they do become
Hermione's friend

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.300
and we want to do
some forward chaining,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:00.758
we'll figure out
that they're going

00:16:00.758 --> 00:16:03.240
to transmute into some
kind of other thing because

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
of the Polyjuice Potion.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.040
But it's not going
to help us do the one

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.581
thing we want to
back chain, which is

00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:08.912
to prove that thing on the top.

00:16:08.912 --> 00:16:10.620
So we actually need
to look for something

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.110
that has our current
goal in its consequent.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.640
Then we add on the antecedents.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.430
As people I've asked
so far-- sorry, I

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.110
don't know your
names-- like Patrick,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.700
have correctly given me every
time, which is excellent.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.400
So notice also
that she didn't say

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.955
x studies a lot needs to
be added to the goal tree.

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:31.195
She said Millicent
studies a lot.

00:16:31.195 --> 00:16:32.290
Oh, another question.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.410
Great.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.200
AUDIENCE: So obviously
after putting rule 4 there,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.837
shouldn't we first check
the assertions-- check

00:16:41.837 --> 00:16:44.405
on the assertions instead of
our conditions [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.540
MARK SEIFTER: So
the question is,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.700
once we put rule
four in there, should

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.885
we check to see if those
antecedents of rule four

00:16:52.885 --> 00:16:57.110
are already in the assertions
before checking other rules?

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.100
The answer?

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.110
You're not only correct, sir,
you're exactly one step ahead.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.010
So I'm going to assume I called
on you for the very next thing.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.770
That's exactly what we do
once we draw it onto the tree.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.000
You're exactly on the way.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.099
Further question?

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.130
Perfect.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.760
All right, great.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.994
So again, we're putting up
Millicent studies a lot.

00:17:19.994 --> 00:17:21.119
Millicent is a protagonist.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.530
We're not putting up x.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.190
Some people did that.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.200
And of course it's an
n node as we heard.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.970
We need them both to be
true or we're not going

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.300
to be able to continue onward.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.860
So we have-- I'm going
to use m for Millicent.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.580
Millicent studies a lot.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.680
Also over here, Millicent
is a protagonist.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.860
And we've already
heard that we need

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.430
to search in the
assertions before we

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.315
go into any rules for what
we're looking for next.

00:17:58.315 --> 00:18:00.690
The question is, what are we
looking for next and in what

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:01.290
order?

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.540
This is where that thing I
told you about depth search

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.860
is crucial.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.944
We are going to look
here on the left node.

00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:09.360
And if it has any children,
if we have to keep going down,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.470
we are not going
to look here yet.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.810
There's a few reasons for that.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.200
One of which is that we're lazy.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.290
The evaluation, if
you learned about it,

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.350
is also-- if you learn about
lazy evaluation, is also lazy.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.845
And if we can disprove
this study's a lot branch,

00:18:23.845 --> 00:18:26.220
we don't have to do any work
with the protagonist branch.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.720
We're done.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.110
We're out of here.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.270
And it's a loss.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:34.460
So we're going to move down
the study's a lot branch.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.360
And we already heard
from the audience,

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.250
we need to look to see if
it's in the assertions.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.020
Everyone, is Millicent studies
a lot in the assertions?

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.430
No, it's not.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.560
Well then, now we're going
to get to that question

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.000
that I had before about the
antecedent or the consequent.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.192
Because study lies here in
the antecedent of rule four,

00:18:55.192 --> 00:18:57.400
but we're not going to be
able to use rule four here.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.920
In fact, that's how we got
here in the first place.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.950
So the question is--
let's see, the question

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:12.360
is, do we have a rule in
the consequent that matches

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.952
Millicent studies a lot.

00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:15.910
Yeah, that's right, P3.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.730
That's right.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.280
So P3 would give us
Millicent studies a lot.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.180
And so therefore what will
we add to the goal tree?

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.655
AUDIENCE: We add both that is
Millicent either a protagonist

00:19:31.655 --> 00:19:33.150
or a villain and [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:34.920
MARK SEIFTER: Yeah, she.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.950
Turns out to be a girl.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.900
So that's exactly right.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.920
We heard that we
need to add-- we

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.845
need to add an AND node,
which also has an OR

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:48.480
node at the bottom
of it, because this

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.650
is a little bit of
a complicated rule.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.380
So we have an AND node.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.980
So we have an AND node.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.630
And the first thing
on the AND node

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:08.230
is Millicent is a protagonist
or Millicent is a villain.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.105
And the second thing on the AND
node is Millicent is ambitious.

00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:21.650
Actually, that is the second
thing on the AND node.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.390
I hope that's what I said.

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:24.525
All right, the second
thing on the AND node

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:25.608
is Millicent is ambitious.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:37.657
So here's our handy little tree.

00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:39.490
Now this is where it's
important, as I said,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.850
we're doing a
depth first search.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.490
We're going down
along the left branch.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:50.885
So where do you think we're
going to go next on this tree?

00:20:50.885 --> 00:20:53.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.467
MARK SEIFTER: Not quite.

00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:56.300
That's a good guess.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.760
You didn't say we're
trying to prove

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.220
m is a protagonist on
the right branch, which

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.261
is a very common mistake.

00:21:00.261 --> 00:21:01.376
What do you do?

00:21:01.376 --> 00:21:02.834
AUDIENCE: You should
go down to see

00:21:02.834 --> 00:21:05.410
if there's a
consequence for m is--

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.870
Millicent is a protagonist.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.210
MARK SEIFTER: Which one
of the two Millicent

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:09.835
is a protagonist do
we want to look at?

00:21:12.232 --> 00:21:13.440
Yeah, the farthest down left.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.800
That's right.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.624
So you guys will
learn depth for search

00:21:16.624 --> 00:21:18.290
on Monday, at which
point it will become

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.498
much clearer what I'm saying.

00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:22.530
But yeah, you always follow
the left branch as far down

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.947
as you can.

00:21:23.947 --> 00:21:26.030
Then you take the right
branch of that same branch

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.585
that you followed.

00:21:27.585 --> 00:21:29.710
Great, so we're going to
try to find that Millicent

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.980
is a protagonist.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.800
What do we do first?

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.332
Everyone?

00:21:34.332 --> 00:21:36.016
Check assertion, yes.

00:21:36.016 --> 00:21:36.640
Is it in there?

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.970
No, it's not.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:38.990
OK.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.150
So, therefore we're
going to try to find

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:47.270
a rule as we heard about whether
Millicent is a protagonist.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.740
So, all the way in the back?

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.938
All the way in the back, is
there a rule that matches?

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.157
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:56.157 --> 00:21:57.990
MARK SEIFTER: That
matches in its consequent

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.810
that Millicent is a protagonist.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:05.712
AUDIENCE: Um, there is a rule.

00:22:05.712 --> 00:22:06.420
MARK SEIFTER: OK.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.590
Well, let's give it a try.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:08.637
Which one?

00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:09.220
AUDIENCE: One.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.761
MARK SEIFTER: Rule
one, that's right.

00:22:10.761 --> 00:22:15.380
So therefore, we would have
to add what to our goal tree?

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.419
AUDIENCE: Another [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:19.252
MARK SEIFTER: Right.

00:22:19.252 --> 00:22:21.188
And what's on that please?

00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:25.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.238
MARK SEIFTER: Yeah, Millicent
lives in Gryffindor Tower,

00:22:27.238 --> 00:22:27.738
perfect.

00:22:27.738 --> 00:22:31.550
So, our new thing that
we're searching for

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.350
is-- pretend this connects.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.170
Actually, I guess
it does connect.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.860
We're looking for m lives
in Gryffindor Tower.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.484
Great.

00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:45.650
And since it's depth first,
that's where we go next.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.270
Great, we're on a roll.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:50.792
So what do we do first?

00:22:50.792 --> 00:22:53.440
Do we have that in assertions?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.750
Some people say yes,
but the answer is no.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.910
We have, in fact, Seamus
living in Gryffindor Tower.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.390
Most of you said "no."

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.000
You're right.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.650
The majority rules.

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.310
We don't have any assertions.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.180
However, do we have a rule
with that in the consequent?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.920
No.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.690
So what do we do?

00:23:13.647 --> 00:23:15.980
People are saying different
things that are all correct.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:16.790
Backtrack, you say.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:17.420
Go to the next.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.170
We can't prove it.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.520
All correct.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.960
Put a big x.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.282
This isn't true.

00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:24.990
Now we'd look up.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.100
We're on an OR node.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:32.490
So we're not done yet because
either of those can be true.

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.120
So now we go back up, backtrack,
Millicent is a villain.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:40.778
What do we do first?

00:23:40.778 --> 00:23:42.152
Check assertions.

00:23:42.152 --> 00:23:43.070
Is it in there?

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.330
No, it's not.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.880
Don't worry, we're getting
to one where it will be,

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.460
where about 40%-- or 30%
to 40% of the class lost

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.160
points, very, very soon.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.770
So, we see that
Millicent is a villain.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.430
And it's not in the assertions.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.930
So therefore, is
there any rule that

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.230
has that in its consequent?

00:24:09.684 --> 00:24:10.559
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:12.749 --> 00:24:15.040
MARK SEIFTER: We're looking
for Millicent is a villain.

00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:18.533
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.902 --> 00:24:24.360
MARK SEIFTER: Oh,
you can't see it.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.200
All right, I will
move it down slightly.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.422
It got a little bit off kilter
when I put in the parentheses

00:24:29.422 --> 00:24:30.130
around the "and."

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.350
Hold on.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.900
There you go.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.150
AUDIENCE: If [INAUDIBLE] is a
protagonist or is a villain.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.422
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:43.422 --> 00:24:44.880
MARK SEIFTER: We're
trying to prove

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.088
that she's a villain, though.

00:24:46.088 --> 00:24:49.255
So do we have any with
that in the consequent?

00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:50.755
[INAUDIBLE] anything
that will prove

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:53.070
that she's a villain if
we fire off that rule.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.162
Want to give here a
little bit of help?

00:24:58.162 --> 00:24:58.703
AUDIENCE: P2.

00:24:58.703 --> 00:25:01.569
If she lives in Slytherin, then
she's a villain [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:01.569 --> 00:25:02.860
MARK SEIFTER: Ah, see that now?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.200
It had two, so it was
a little bit harder.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.510
Now some people ask, what
about that ambitious thing?

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:09.426
Can we like add that to
the tree or something?

00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:10.190
No.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.800
The backward chainer is
single-minded, focused,

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.097
and stupid.

00:25:14.097 --> 00:25:16.430
Even though it's later going
to need to prove that she's

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.239
ambitious, it doesn't care.

00:25:18.239 --> 00:25:19.530
It just sees the villain there.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:21.200
Villain, oh, that's great.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.370
As long as we've
got the antecedent

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.690
we are going to be happy.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.290
This is actually
an important point,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:32.200
not in this particular problem,
but in some other problems.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.280
So by using P2,
we're obviously going

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.151
to have the antecedent x
lives in Slytherin dungeon.

00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:41.150
And x here is Millicent.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.816
So Millicent lives
in Slytherin dungeon.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.600
All right, so what's
the first thing

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.380
we do when we see
this new assertion?

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.430
We check the assertions.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.910
Is it in there?

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:57.600
Yes.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.183
That's not where
everyone lost points,

00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:01.314
but yes, it is in there.

00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:02.290
Check.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.260
This OR node is happy.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.680
Now we move up to the AND node
with Millicent is ambitious.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.080
So Millicent is ambitious.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.830
What do we do now?

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:18.770
AUDIENCE: So isn't
the consequent of P2

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.210
that x is a villain
and x is ambitious.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:25.114
I don't know if it's
[INAUDIBLE] or whatever,

00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:28.042
but in our assertions we have
that Millicent is ambitious.

00:26:28.042 --> 00:26:29.994
Is that necessary to let us--

00:26:29.994 --> 00:26:31.954
MARK SEIFTER: To
let us use rule two.

00:26:31.954 --> 00:26:33.940
Actually, no.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:40.660
The question is,
do we need the x is

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:45.520
ambitious to be in our list of
assertions in order to use P2.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.280
For instance, if we didn't have
the assertion that Millicent

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.167
is ambitious, would P2
have a problem firing?

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.315
So, it's a very
interesting question.

00:26:56.315 --> 00:26:57.940
It's sort of what
actually I was trying

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.140
to mention earlier when I
said it's single-minded,

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.550
it's focused, it doesn't
care about the other one.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.341
Because you might say,
well, wait a minute,

00:27:06.341 --> 00:27:08.300
P2 could never
have actually fired

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.520
if it didn't have both
of its consequents.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.130
But in fact, the backward
chainer doesn't care.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.560
All that the backward
chainer is looking to do

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.760
is to prove whether
or not there's

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.880
a possibility that Millicent
might be a villain.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.530
It's not trying to say,
oh, all the results

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.455
of some certain rules are
making Millicent a villain

00:27:30.455 --> 00:27:33.390
and all the other things that
are there, like ambitious, are

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.522
in the database.

00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:35.730
It's not the forward chainer.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.130
It actually doesn't care.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.560
This sometimes leads to
unnecessary computation.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.110
But it's very simple, and
it's very simple to code.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.160
So it often will probably
speed you up in the long run.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.150
Like if there's, for instance,
100 thing in the then

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.226
and you only care
about one of them,

00:27:50.226 --> 00:27:52.100
it would be a waste,
almost, to add those 99.

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:57.030
There's a follow up
over here somewhere?

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:57.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.946 --> 00:28:03.386
AUDIENCE: Order m of 99.

00:28:03.386 --> 00:28:04.362
And so [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.740
MARK SEIFTER: You can try.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.600
However, then at that
point, every time

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.520
you check the
assertions, you'd be

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.250
attempting to check those 99.

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:19.270
Also, you might not
have used those rules.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.660
The question is, could
you make a hash table

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.190
with all of the 100 things
that were in the consequent?

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.840
And then, after having
made that hash table

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.320
since you were already
walking through those anyway

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.300
when you were checking
it, you could add those

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.049
to the assertions.

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:36.830
The problem is that you
might not necessarily

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.200
want-- with the backward
chainer-- you might not

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.340
necessarily want
to think that all

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.860
those things in the consequent
are necessarily true.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.620
However, you might
not care about them.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.590
And then you have
to make an order

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.090
and computation every time you
check that list of assertions

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.271
in the upper left.

00:28:55.271 --> 00:28:56.146
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:02.110
MARK SEIFTER: You don't know
what assertions there are.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.200
You have to check the
entire list of assertions

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.240
in the upper left
every time you get

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.760
to a new node in the goal tree.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.550
So each one is order 1.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.060
But I'm not saying to find a
specific assertion is order n.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.530
I'm saying every time you get
a new node in the goal tree,

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.999
you have to check all the
assertions you've added.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:20.540
AUDIENCE: You have to do that
anyway. [INAUDIBLE] assertions.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.748
MARK SEIFTER: Yeah, you'd
have to check for the four.

00:29:22.748 --> 00:29:26.710
But let's say that there were
10,000 consequents of P2.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.930
You would have to check
10,000 instead of four

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.750
if you added them
all after proving

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.990
P2 was true on the goal tree.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.820
Also, another important
note is that you might not

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.420
use every branch
of the goal tree,

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.160
if there's like an
OR that's up higher

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.110
and you wind up using a
different branch, in which case

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.901
you'd probably have to
make a separate hash

00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:47.910
table for every
sub-branch that you have

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:50.060
and then remember which
hash tables were updated

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.850
based on which sub-branch.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.430
And then sub-branches die.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.906
It's probably more
effort than it's worth.

00:29:56.906 --> 00:29:58.530
It's certainly an
interesting question.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.890
It's a great question for
a debate in recitation.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.980
Also, I'm happy to
talk about it later.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.750
I think that someone who very
intelligently made hash tables

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.180
and thought the problem
through, as Patrick said,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.342
more knowledge can
mean a better-- well,

00:30:12.342 --> 00:30:14.550
actually maybe he hasn't
said more knowledge can mean

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.924
a better search because we
haven't done that lecture yet,

00:30:16.924 --> 00:30:18.020
but--

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.270
AUDIENCE: You're talking
about implementation decision

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.975
and using hash table might
well be a good way to do this.

00:30:23.975 --> 00:30:27.056
The problem is that we're
presuming some things about how

00:30:27.056 --> 00:30:30.444
the rules are firing and
what [INAUDIBLE] they're

00:30:30.444 --> 00:30:33.832
firing that depend on the order
of assertions in the table.

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.736
So if we used the hash
table, we'd lose the order.

00:30:36.736 --> 00:30:38.597
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:38.597 --> 00:30:39.680
MARK SEIFTER: That's true.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.195
That's true.

00:30:40.195 --> 00:30:41.820
But I'm thinking like
if someone wanted

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.790
to make that implementation as
like do some research in rules

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.890
based systems, it's possible you
can increase the running speed.

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.260
In this class, we are
not completely as focused

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.940
on the fastest algorithms.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.440
But I still think that
a cool thing to try.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.860
Questions from
people in the crowd?

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:00.800
We'll start with you.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.420
AUDIENCE: So ignoring
the hash table?

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.920
MARK SEIFTER: Ignore
the hash table.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.296
That's a good idea because
it's a little extra enrichment

00:31:06.296 --> 00:31:06.795
thing.

00:31:06.795 --> 00:31:08.500
It's not anything
you would possibly

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.646
need to know for the quiz.

00:31:10.646 --> 00:31:14.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
So if it became

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.618
an [INAUDIBLE] are you
using this "then" statement

00:31:17.618 --> 00:31:19.610
because you want the villain.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.096
So along with using this
you get x is ambitious.

00:31:23.096 --> 00:31:26.582
[INAUDIBLE] used after that,
another "then" statement

00:31:26.582 --> 00:31:29.072
that we also use that
says x is not ambitious.

00:31:29.072 --> 00:31:31.845
So how would you resolve that?

00:31:31.845 --> 00:31:33.220
MARK SEIFTER: So
the question is,

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:36.370
let's say you used rule
two somewhere in the tree

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.480
to get that x is
a villain, which

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.480
then says that x is ambitious.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.900
Then later, you have
x is not ambitious

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:50.192
somewhere in one of the other
rules that you then later need.

00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:51.900
The question is, how
do you resolve that?

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.750
What does it do?

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.705
Well, first of all--

00:31:53.705 --> 00:31:54.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.880
MARK SEIFTER: First
of all, interestingly,

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.537
if it says x is not ambitious--
literally like that.

00:32:05.537 --> 00:32:06.870
And I'm not being pedantic here.

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:08.245
This is one of
the tricks someone

00:32:08.245 --> 00:32:11.060
played in a previous quiz.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.050
You can have that
and x is ambitious

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.340
both in the list because it's
a dumb rules-based system it

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.190
doesn't know that you can't
have both of those on the list.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.760
So if you have a positive
assertion in a consequent,

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.990
x is not ambitious in a
consequent, x is not ambitious,

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:29.000
it'll be happy to add
Millicent is not ambitious

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.730
while Millicent ambitious
this is already there,

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.020
because it's stupid.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.490
Now if it had
delete Millicent is

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.740
ambitious in the consequent
and deleted something that

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:44.110
was previously there, that
would be an interesting problem.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.406
It could cause mistakes.

00:32:46.406 --> 00:32:47.780
Your back chaining
would probably

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.196
make the mistake
of allowing this.

00:32:49.196 --> 00:32:53.580
However, this is exactly what we
do not, I believe as a policy,

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.795
do not have DELETE
statements on the quizzes.

00:32:58.496 --> 00:32:59.870
At least previous
quizzes did not

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.170
have them, except
for in a hypothetical

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.480
of what happens if we add
a DELETE statement here.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.480
I don't think we've ever
made people work things

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.610
through with the delete.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.910
Delete would possibly
cause some issues.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:12.460
Question in the back?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.930
AUDIENCE: So, just
to check this,

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.053
we're doing backwards
chaining, we

00:33:16.053 --> 00:33:18.350
don't actually add assertions
to your [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.230
MARK SEIFTER: Never add
assertions in backward chain

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.188
to the assertion table.

00:33:21.188 --> 00:33:22.840
It's dumb.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:23.890
The system is dumb.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.850
I'm not saying it's a
dumb idea to do this.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.040
It's actually pretty
fast to do it this way.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.840
But the system is dumb.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.204
The question is, do
you add assertions

00:33:32.204 --> 00:33:33.370
or you don't add assertions?

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.610
You do not.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.350
You simply go through, checking
all the things on your goal

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.050
tree until the goal tree is
either proven or disproven,

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.530
then you're out of here.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.660
So, cool so far, everyone?

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.080
Good questions from everyone.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.790
These are all questions
that are things

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.300
that often trip people up.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.190
So, our next thing,
Millicent is ambitious.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.259
We sort of-- the cat
is out of the bag

00:33:53.259 --> 00:33:55.300
because there is a question
mentioning that there

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.130
is an assertion that says that.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.290
But I direct you guys to
our favorite rule, rule two.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.000
Shouldn't we use
rule two to prove

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.480
that Millicent is ambitious?

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.010
The answer is if you want to
lose four points or however

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.420
many points, then yes.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.130
But if you don't
want to lose points,

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:22.280
then this is already correct
by virtue of assertion one.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.250
So I guess I should write,
also, that this over here,

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:33.840
Millicent studies a lot
rule, this rule is rule four.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.210
Yeah, that's rule four
[INAUDIBLE] and protagonist.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:40.980
Down here to prove that she
studies a lot is rule three.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:48.989
And then at the bottom here
we have what rules here?

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:52.870
We have the protagonist
rule, which is one,

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:55.610
and the villain
rule which is two.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.250
This is correct virtue of A0.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.390
OK, great.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:08.670
So we've proved
this whole AND node.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.700
We know that Millicent
studies a lot.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:12.824
But now we're going to have
to go a little bit more

00:35:12.824 --> 00:35:16.080
quickly based on time, and so
I will do the remaining things.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.270
Anyone who has not been
called on is off the hook.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.760
But that doesn't mean
not to pay attention

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.100
because there's some
interesting stuff still to come.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.350
So, Millicent is a protagonist.

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.460
Well, good news, everyone.

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.770
There's one other reason
that I can do this

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.500
and that's that you've already
told me what I need to do.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:37.810
Most is a protagonist, you
use rule one, rule one.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.580
And check if she lives
in Gryffindor tower.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.031
Now, will it do it again?

00:35:43.031 --> 00:35:44.340
Yes it will.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.715
It hasn't cached that
it's already tried that.

00:35:47.715 --> 00:35:49.840
Now, hash table not
withstanding, caching something

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.810
you've already tried may be
a good idea with backward

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.070
chaining, but we do not
do that in this class.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.610
That's an implementation detail.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.672
It's another idea of
something you can do.

00:35:58.672 --> 00:36:00.630
We don't catch things
that we've already tried.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.250
We try them again, dammit.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.170
And when we try it again,
maybe it'll work this time.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.390
No, it never works.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.725
It never works this time.

00:36:09.725 --> 00:36:10.490
This fails.

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:12.000
This AND node fails.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.880
The whole thing fails.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.820
They're not friends at all.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:19.310
They're bitter enemies.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.120
Millicent does not
become Hermione's friend.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.510
So now they ask
us a few questions

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.020
which are pretty easy to answer
based on the ordeal we've just

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.950
been through.

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.580
So, determine the minimum
number of additional assertions

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.450
that we would need
to add for Millicent

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.180
to become Hermione's friend.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.740
But you're not allowed
to add an assertion that

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.820
matches a consequent of a rule.

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.060
You can only add an
assertion-- in other words,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.030
you can't add an assertion that
will prove some other rules.

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:55.090
You have to add an assertion
that directly-- yeah,

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:56.880
that's basically the rule here.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.820
Because there's
a lot of choices.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.440
But he wanted one
particular answer.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.105
And so can anyone
think of an assertion

00:37:03.105 --> 00:37:06.650
that doesn't match any
consequent of any rule that

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:11.560
will make her be
Hermione's friend.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.680
A lot of people say Millicent
lives in Gryffindor.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.304
That's correct.

00:37:14.304 --> 00:37:16.640
So, part three, your
solution to part two

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.650
causes an uncommon situation.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.140
What is the uncommon situation?

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.780
And what should you do
to the list of assertions

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.770
to solve this problem?

00:37:27.207 --> 00:37:29.040
Does anyone know what
the uncommon situation

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.300
would be if we added that
she lives in Gryffindor?

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.330
Hand is raised up here.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:33.935
What is your answer?

00:37:33.935 --> 00:37:36.687
[INAUDIBLE] That's true.

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.270
She lives in Gryffindor
and Slytherin.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.742
So how would you fix that?

00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:46.090
[INAUDIBLE] Yes,
you could take out

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.270
Slytherin from the assertions
and say that she only

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.540
lived in Gryffindor.

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:54.159
A lot of people gave the
answer to this question,

00:37:54.159 --> 00:37:55.700
which is a perfectly
reasonable thing

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.270
to do in a rules-basis system.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.440
They said, well, we
can add a rule that

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:06.060
says that if you live in x and
y is different than x, then

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:08.040
you can't live in y.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.520
The problem with that,
among other things,

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.290
is that we asked for a way to
change the assertions and not

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:13.850
the rules.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:15.340
And you gave us a way to
change the assertions.

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.340
That's the right answer.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.210
There was another
backward chaining problem,

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:32.030
this is 2009 quiz one,
and I will leave it off

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.800
for the moment.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.110
You guys should
take a look at it,

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.550
in particular with
variable binding.

00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:40.150
Because remember, you
always have to bind

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.171
the variable that's
relevant to you.

00:38:42.171 --> 00:38:43.920
But that doesn't mean
that you always have

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.460
to bind all of the variables.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.270
For instance, let's
say that we wanted

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.290
to prove that Millicent
has a bad term, which

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.081
as it turns out, is
what we wanted to prove

00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:52.490
in the other backward chaining.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:57.549
Very quickly and without doing
the problem, can anyone who

00:38:57.549 --> 00:38:59.840
thinks they're very clever
at backward chaining tell me

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:03.860
exactly what things would
be added to the goal tree

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.590
to prove that Millicent
has a bad term?

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.256
Raise your hand.

00:39:06.256 --> 00:39:08.350
I won't pick out a
victim because I'm asking

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.955
this to happen pretty quickly.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.330
No one?

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.732
All right.

00:39:20.732 --> 00:39:25.405
AUDIENCE: You would add the
three antecedents to rule--

00:39:25.405 --> 00:39:26.530
MARK SEIFTER: To rule five.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.580
So what would you
add specifically?

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.282
AUDIENCE: For anyone,
variable-wise,

00:39:30.282 --> 00:39:32.365
you would just have to
show that there is at least

00:39:32.365 --> 00:39:34.160
one person who matches.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.860
MARK SEIFTER: So can you
just sort of read out,

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.580
what would the first
thing say with the snogs?

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.200
AUDIENCE: X snogs-- or
Millicent snogs anyone.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.200
MARK SEIFTER: Yeah,
Millicent snogs y.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.120
That's crucial.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.910
Some people did a lot
of different things.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.660
Some people put
Seamus in already.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.140
You can't do that.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.970
The system is stupid, it doesn't
know that the person is Seamus.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:57.860
Also, some people
said it worked,

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.610
because look, they're
snogging each other,

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.130
but it's the wrong snoggle
direction up there.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.460
Because we have Seamus
snogging Millicent,

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.710
not Millicent snogging Seamus.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.418
But yes, exactly.

00:40:09.418 --> 00:40:11.440
It would be Millicent snogs y.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.980
Millicent lives in
Gryffindor tower.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.160
y lives in Slytherin dungeon.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.930
So, let's give forward chaining
all the attention it deserves,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.895
about eight minutes, which
will be more than enough.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.570
OK, we still got
all these rules.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.410
We've still got all
these assertions.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:33.345
Instead of doing that horrible
backward chaining-- well,

00:40:33.345 --> 00:40:35.640
it's not that horrible-- but
we'll do forward chaining.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.880
It'll be really easy.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.900
We'll just add new
assertions as they go.

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.260
Remember the tiebreak order.

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.400
Rules in order from 0 to 5.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:46.490
And if the same
rule could fire off

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:48.530
with multiple
different assertions,

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.160
we'll use the assertions
in order from 0 to 3.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.160
So let's see.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.530
We don't have much time, but
with our four assertions,

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.310
let's see, what
rules possibly could

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.110
match with our four assertions?

00:41:04.110 --> 00:41:06.390
Well, I'll figure out for you.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.100
Do we have an assertion
about an ambitious person?

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:09.600
Yes.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.720
But they're not a squib.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.917
So not rule zero.

00:41:11.917 --> 00:41:13.750
Do we have someone that
lives in Gryffindor?

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.580
We absolutely do.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.019
Rule one is matches.

00:41:16.019 --> 00:41:17.810
Do we have someone that
lives in Slytherin?

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:18.560
We do.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.550
Rule two matches.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:21.850
Do we have a protagonist
or a villain?

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.680
We don't have any
protagonist or villain.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.500
Rule three is not going to
match because it's in an "and."

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.440
do we have someone
who studies a lot?

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.149
We do not have someone
who studies a lot.

00:41:30.149 --> 00:41:31.481
Rule four is not going to match.

00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:32.730
Do we have some snogging?

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.220
We do have some snogging.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.500
So rule one, two,
and five match.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.810
So m for matching, we
have one, two and five.

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:43.180
Everyone, which one wins the
tiebreak between one, two,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.350
and five?

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:47.070
One, because it comes
first numerically.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.740
Which one is rule one if x
lives in Gryffindor tower?

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.980
The only binding
for x is Seamus.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.810
Seamus lives in
Gryffindor tower.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.520
We're firing off rule one.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.260
So new assertions, the first
assertion that we'll add

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:06.075
is Seamus is it a protagonist.

00:42:06.075 --> 00:42:06.575
Great.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.060
Now, there's one
other thing, and it's

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.590
the main thing I wanted to tell
you about in forward chaining.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.420
About our old friend, rule
one, now that we've done this,

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.940
does rule one still match an
assertion in the database?

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.450
Yes.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.590
It does.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.186
But what's going to stop us
from constantly doing rule one

00:42:32.186 --> 00:42:33.810
every time because
it comes numerically

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.650
before the other rules?

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.260
What stops us there is a
part of our implementation.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.840
And it's a very important part
that people sometimes forget.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.240
It's what I like to call
the no-impotent rules

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240
implementation detail.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.220
That is, if a rule
is completely,

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:51.190
100% impotent, it would
do absolutely nothing.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.505
Then you do not fire it.

00:42:52.505 --> 00:42:53.990
You go to the next one.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.200
That's pretty important.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.350
Let's say that you possibly
had a delete, which

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.660
you won't have on the quiz.

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.630
That means that if the
thing to delete is missing,

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:03.520
it's impotent.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.720
If the thing to delete is
there, it's not impotent

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.200
because you can delete.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.990
Let's say you have 500,000
things that you're going

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:11.700
to add to your assertions.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.670
499,999 are already
in your database.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:16.740
One of them is missing.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.390
Is it an impotent rule?

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.090
No, it's not.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.360
You have to fire it anyway.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:23.060
You can't be like, oh,
it's mostly impotent rule.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.560
No.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.147
You have fire off the rule
if it will do anything.

00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:29.730
But right now rule one won't do
anything because we've already

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.590
added Seamus is a protagonist.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.260
So what rules match down?

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.510
Well, Seamus becoming a
protagonist is nice and all,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:40.620
but he's not ambitious, so we
still don't match rule three.

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.230
We still match rules
one, two, and five.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.460
As I basically just got
finished telling you,

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.930
the one that we're going
to fire off now is two.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.000
That's right.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.240
So, rule two is if x
lives in Slytherin dungeon

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.130
our only [? binding ?]
for that is Millicent.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.950
And that will show that she's
a villain and she's ambitious.

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:04.372
So what assertions will we add?

00:44:04.372 --> 00:44:05.330
Millicent is a villain.

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:06.570
And people stopped.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.380
That's right.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.410
Good job, everyone.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.350
You remembered that
Millicent is already

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:15.080
ambitious from assertion one, so
we don't have to add them both.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.340
A lot of people did.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.580
They were wrong.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.550
So Millicent is a villain.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.020
The other part of that
rule doesn't do anything.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.420
But it's not an impotent rule
because one of the things

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.410
is not on there.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.740
Great.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.890
So, what rules match now?

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.150
Well, as it turns out,
now that Millicent

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.700
is a villain and ambitious,
we match rule three as well.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.370
So we match one,
two, three, and five.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.710
What rule are we going
to fire, everyone?

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:44.210
Three.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.470
Because one and two
are impotent rules.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.890
We'll fire rule three.

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:50.800
Well, Millicent is a villain.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.770
She's also ambitious.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.890
She's our only match for three.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:57.250
Therefore, what
assertion do we add?

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:58.250
Millicent studies a lot.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.791
That's right.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.220
So, Millicent studies a lot.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.820
However, she's
not a protagonist.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.180
We still don't match rule four.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.520
Oh well, we figured that
out already ourselves

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.400
from backward chaining that we
were never going to match that.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.210
So what matches?

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:21.200
It's still one, two,
three, and five.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.950
Seeing as one, two and
three are impotent,

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.695
the only match is five.

00:45:26.695 --> 00:45:28.570
So the only match we
care about, the only one

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.970
we're going to fire is five.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:32.220
And the result?

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.280
Let's see.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.180
x snogs y.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.020
That's Seamus snogs Millicent.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:39.010
x lives in Gryffindor,
that's Seamus.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.130
y lives in Slytherin,
that's Millicent.

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:43.870
So what do we add?

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.360
Seamus has a bad term.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:46:00.000
Simple, painless, it works out.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.860
We're done.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.430
And we got 100 on this quiz.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.180
Hopefully you guys will, too.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.000
Question?

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.640
The question is, if you have
a new assertion which matches

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.520
a rule but it's
really high number,

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.150
it's all the way down at
the bottom of the rules,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.350
but it's new and
it has new stuff,

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.220
should we do that first,
maybe, because it's new?

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.075
Oh, you mean that it has a
lower number, a lower number?

00:46:23.075 --> 00:46:23.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.630
MARK SEIFTER: OK,
so the question

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:29.270
is, if a rule-- let's say
that rule three made Millicent

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:30.920
be a squib.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.090
Then yes, you'd
immediately not only match

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.715
zero-- zero would immediately
fire because numerically

00:46:36.715 --> 00:46:37.900
it comes first.

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.790
You'll see that on some
of the old quizzes.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.604
And you may see
that in tutorial.

00:46:41.604 --> 00:46:44.270
If you guys want to do some more
practice problems in tutorials,

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.356
your TAs will have
that available as one

00:46:46.356 --> 00:46:47.355
opportunity in tutorial.

00:46:47.355 --> 00:46:48.930
But yeah, that's exactly right.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:50.930
It happened that it
went in order this time,

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.130
but it will definitely
hop anywhere

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:57.217
it can in order to get to the
lowest numbered assertion.
