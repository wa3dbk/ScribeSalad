00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.340
PATRICK WINSTON: We might wonder
a little bit about the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.540
nature of human intelligence,
and we might reflect a little

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.230
bit on the kind of intelligence
we've been

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.310
talking about in the
past few weeks.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.160
It's been an intelligence
of sorts.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.980
Those programs, support vector
machines, boosting, they can

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.030
do really smart things.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.710
But the peculiar thing about
systems that use those methods

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.770
is that those systems don't
have any idea about what

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.260
they're doing.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.380
They don't know anything.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.810
So they don't give us very much
of an insight into the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.720
nature of human intelligence.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.500
And, after all, I'd like to
have a model of human

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.000
intelligence because, let's face
it, we're the smartest

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.830
things around.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.760
So there are lots of ways to
approach that question.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.090
And we'll approach that
question first from a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.560
evolutionary point of view.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.990
Some scientists believe, me for
instance, that we have a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:26.280
family tree that looks
about like this.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.970
Too small to see much of that,
but the main point is that we

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.360
haven't been around very long.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
We humans have been around maybe
200,000 years, and the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.030
dinosaurs died out 60
million years ago.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.890
So in the blink of an eye, we
seem to have, more or less,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.500
taken over.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.590
When you look at that family
tree on a scale where you can

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.960
see it, one of the
characteristics is increasing

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.210
brain size.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.980
There we are on the left,
chimpanzee on the right.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.300
Clearly, mostly mouth, not
to much brain in there.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.040
That one down below is a
reconstruction of one of those

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.380
pithecus type bipedal apes
from about 4 million

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.680
years ago or so.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.770
So we became bipedal a
long time before we

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.810
had much of a brain.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.980
So you might think, well, maybe
brain size has a lot to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.080
do with it, and I
suppose it does.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.700
So we can plot brain volume of
our ancestors versus time.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.950
So the picture I just showed you
was from about 3 million

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.740
years ago, I guess.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.530
And then on the upper right hand
corner, oh, that's not

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.500
just us, that's also
the Neanderthals.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.750
Their brains might have been
slightly bigger than ours.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.020
So it isn't just brain size.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.660
Here's what that
guy looks like.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.930
That's a Neanderthal, of
course, on the left.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.680
And that's one of
us on the right.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.630
Some conspicuous differences,
big heads, the rib cage is

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.130
kind of conical in shape,
a large pelvis.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.670
People like to make a lot of
speculations about how they

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.031
must have moved around.

00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.062
But one thing is plain, they
didn't amount to much.

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:29.300
They could make stone tools, but
those stone tools didn't

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.170
change much over tens of
thousands of years.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.240
And that was pretty much the
story with us too, until

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.400
something happened, probably in
southern Africa, probably

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.500
in a group of individuals,
maybe less than 1,000.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.520
And what's the evidence
for that?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.840
The evidence for that
is mostly--

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.420
comes from DNA studies with
a lot of probabilistic

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.850
assumptions, and Monte Carlo
simulations, but it seems

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.640
among the competing hypothesis
for how we came to populate

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.290
the world, it seems that there
was a group of us, homo

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.820
sapiens, in Southern Africa that
got something that nobody

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.920
else had and the highest
probability scenario is that

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.870
we quickly took over.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.560
That population of homo sapiens
dominated the rest,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.970
went out of Africa, and within
the blink of an eye did that

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.220
sort of stuff.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.330
What's that sort of stuff?

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.120
Those two paintings are
from Lascaux about

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.190
25,000 years ago.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.870
Paleoanthropologists, like
Tattersall, take that as plain

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.190
evidence that there was symbolic
thought on the people

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.710
who were around at that
time, us homo sapiens.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.120
The head is a carving of a
mastodon tusk of a woman

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.110
25,000 years ago.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.750
Also, plainly symbolic, people
are making a lot of jewelry

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.860
and doing self adornment.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.130
The Neanderthals never
seemed to do that.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.180
That jewelry making seems to
have gone back to Southern

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.410
Africa, maybe 70,000
years ago.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.060
People were puncturing seashells
and using them as

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.990
necklaces, apparently.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.350
So something happened, and the
paleoanthropologists, who

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.110
write fascinating stuff, don't
quite know how to talk about

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.360
it other than to say
it looks like we

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.820
became somehow symbolic.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.780
And somehow that has something
to do with language.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.280
So if you talk to Noam
Chomsky he will say--

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.020
let me get this precise,
this is near his

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.450
quotation as I can get.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.920
He thinks it was the ability to
take two concepts and put

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.400
them together to form a third
concept without disturbing the

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.850
original concepts and without
limit, and each

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.030
part of that's important.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.100
The without limit part is what
separates us from species that

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.660
might be able to do that a
little bit, but we can do it

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.210
without any apparent limit.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.760
So that's a linguist speaking.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.910
He talks a lot about the
merge operation, and

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.080
combinators and language--

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.680
using terms foreign to us.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.550
Better not use the term
"combinator," it's kind of a

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.810
computer science term.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.210
But whatever it is, it seemed
to happen about that time.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.980
It didn't happen slowly and
proportion to brain size, it

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.460
seemed to happen all of a sudden
in consequence of a

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.520
brain that had grown big enough
to be an enablement but

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.480
the capability was
not what pulled

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.710
evolution in that direction.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.000
So, I believe, that whatever
that was, that capability,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.540
enabled humans, us humans, to
tell and understand stories,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.150
and that's what separates us
from the other primates.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.300
That ability to--

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.280
The symbolic ability, whatever
it is, enabled storytelling

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.070
and understanding.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.770
And that's what all education
is about and that's why our

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.880
species is special.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.830
So what we're going to talk
about today is something you

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.720
might think of as an
instantiation of that

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.740
hypothesis, one way of
thinking about it.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.920
And it's a way of thinking about
what the linguists would

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.090
call the inner language.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.240
It's not the language with which
we communicate, it's the

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.660
language with which we think,
which is closely related to

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.840
the language with which we
communicate, but may not be

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.090
quite the same thing.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.900
So many of you are bilingual.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.200
Chris is bilingual.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.640
Chris, have you ever had the
experience of remembering that

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.860
someone said something to you,
but not remembering what

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.658
language they used?

00:07:36.658 --> 00:07:37.908
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.250
PATRICK WINSTON: How about
[? you, Sian, ?] have you had

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.677
that experience?

00:07:44.677 --> 00:07:45.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.420
PATRICK WINSTON: What?

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.670
STUDENT: I always [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:52.490
PATRICK WINSTON: [INAUDIBLE]
experience of having--

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.010
David, have you ever had that
experience of remembering some

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.140
conversation but not remembering
the language in

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.660
which it was cast?

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.046
STUDENT: Well, you remember
something you usually don't

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.894
know which language
it was in anyway.

00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:03.880
PATRICK WINSTON: You usually
don't remember.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.480
That's a common view.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.110
You remember something was
said, that there was a

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.640
conversation that had some
content, but if it's with a

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.250
speaker of your own language and
your embedded in another

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.340
place, you often don't remember
what language the

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.110
conversation was in.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.500
Is that right, [? Wana, ?] you
remember things like that?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.912
Not sure?

00:08:23.912 --> 00:08:25.941
STUDENT: People who [INAUDIBLE]
speak in a certain

00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:27.520
language, so--

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.060
PATRICK WINSTON: Sometimes you
don't have that confusion, she

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.400
says, because you always speak
to particular people in a

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.330
particular language.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.169
But many people report that they
have that experience of

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.289
not remembering which language
something was said in.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.590
Well, OK, so what are
we going to do?

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.610
We need an inner language, and
maybe we can start just by

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.690
saying, let's have something
that looks sort

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.980
of familiar to us.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:55.290
We have an object and it's
supported by some other

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.960
objects, so those are
support relations.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.850
That's one example of what we
might call a semantic net.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.940
It's a network that's got nodes
and links, it's got--

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.640
it has some meaning.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.790
That's where the word "semantic"
comes from.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.760
Well, we might have another
example that looks like this.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:30.640
There's Macbeth, there's Duncan,
and Macbeth murders

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:39.870
Duncan, then we also know,
somehow, there's a kill

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.720
involved as a consequence,
and then ultimately,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.300
Duncan has a property.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.870
And that property is the
property of being dead.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.530
So there's another semantic net
recording something that

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:06.030
happens in Shakespeare's
Macbeth plot.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.880
Now, we can decorate
that a little bit.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.200
So as to get a couple of
other concepts in play.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.090
First of all, the thing we've
got already is we've got

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.340
combinators.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.770
Then combinators.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.590
Well, a fancy name for those
links that connect the nodes.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.410
Another thing we've got is an
opportunity for connecting the

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.370
links themselves.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.920
So the murder sort of implies
the kill, and the kill leads

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.170
us to conclude that the
victim is dead.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.720
So that is treating the links
themselves as objects that can

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.240
be the subject or object
of other links.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:04.630
So we call that process
"reification."

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.100
Now, in artificial intelligence,
semantic nets

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.460
we're all over the early work,
but if you have a big network

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.780
that covers the wall you need
some way of putting a

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.810
spotlight on some
pieces of it.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:22.580
So Marvin Minsky put a lot of
technical content into that

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.830
idea and created
the notion of--

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.210
a notion that deserves
another color here--

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.850
he suggested that we need a
localization process, so we

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.110
have frames, so-called
frames or templates.

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:41.340
And a frame for this murder
action might be that there's a

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:51.450
murder frame that has an agent
and has a victim, and the

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:59.650
agent is Macbeth, and the
victim is Duncan.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:13.780
So that's a way of putting a
localization layer on top of

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.230
what we've got so far.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.900
Later on, I'll add sequence
to that list.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.820
So this is where it rested for
a long time, and in some

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.300
sense, still rests there because
as soon as you've got

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.110
combinators, you've
got something

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.690
that's pretty much universal.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.690
You can do anything with it.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.060
The trouble is it's sort of
down at the bit level.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.390
It's like assembly code.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:44.230
It doesn't have, as a concept,
enough organization to help

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.360
you go to the next level
of achievement.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.760
There's also a little problem
here that deserves also, some

00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:00.770
mention, and that is that we
have, over this whole thing,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.265
the problem of parasitic
semantics.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.695
Parasitic semantics.

00:13:15.318 --> 00:13:18.320
A kind of ugliness that
surrounds this whole concept

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.360
because when we look at a
diagram like that, and we say,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.260
oh, Macbeth murdered
Duncan, that means

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.880
Duncan's the victim.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.720
We know there must have been a
motive, maybe Macbeth wanted

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.190
to be king.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:31.810
Well, we know all that stuff,
and there's a tendency to

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.530
project that knowing
into the machine.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.920
If you're going to play with
your telephone, please leave.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:51.870
So if we project meaning into
that that's our understanding

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.750
that's not the machine's
understanding.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.815
So much of the meaning can
be said to be parasitic.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.740
We're the parasite, and
we're projecting

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.325
the into that thing.

00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:05.110
Putting that diagram into some
machine form doesn't mean the

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.710
machine knows anything.

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.140
It might be able to conclude
some things, but it's

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.300
understanding is not grounded
in any kind of contact with

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.880
the physical world.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.310
So we have to worry a lot
about that and where

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.460
philosophers would stop there
and go off and write a few

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.340
books on the subject.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.470
But we're not philosophers so
we're going to just mention

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.700
the problem and go
barreling ahead.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.220
So we need to use this notion
of semantic net, and we have

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.200
to ask ourselves some questions
about what elements

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.660
of the inner language are most
useful and yet it might be

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.960
very complicated, but here's
usefulness number one.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.330
The notion of classification.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.660
So we know about stuff,
and we know about,

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.055
for example, pianos.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.055
And we know about tools.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.300
And we know about maps.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:06.010
But we know about those things
on different levels.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:11.120
So say I'm thinking about a
tool, do you have a very good

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.960
image of what I'm
talking about?

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.690
The answer has to be no because
the notion of a tool

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:18.960
is very vague, so it's hard
to form a picture of

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.360
what that's all about.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.720
On the other hand, if I said
I'm thinking about a mac.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.990
Well, this is interesting
because there's lexical

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.670
ambiguity there.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.970
You don't know if I'm talking
about the Apple type Mac or

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.400
the apple type Mac, or
should I say the

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.800
fruit or the computer?

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.660
So there's lexical ambiguity
there at two levels or more.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.260
But let's fill this
in a little bit.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.010
If I know I'm talking about a
piano, you can form a picture

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.100
of that so that seems to be on
a more detailed level where

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.750
you can do hallucination.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.720
At a higher level you have just
a musical instrument.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.210
And I can give you a tool to
think about by writing hammer.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.060
And if I'm going to
have a mac, it's

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.890
going to be an apple.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:15.480
And in this case, I want you
to think about a fruit.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.650
And down here, I can be
more specific about

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.850
these things too.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.330
I can add a slight refinement
of detail and say, I'm

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:25.723
thinking about one of these.

00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:28.014
Do you know what this is?

00:16:28.014 --> 00:16:29.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.070
PATRICK WINSTON: No, it's not
a mere hammer, it's a

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.590
ball-peen hammer.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.290
In some circles, it's called
a ladies hammer.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.600
I don't know why.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.050
But it's--

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.580
What's it for?

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.420
Most people buy it mostly
because it's

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.060
small and light weight.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.570
But, in fact, it's for
metal working.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.810
It's for taking a piece of sheet
metal and pounding it

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.630
out into an ashtray
or something

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.870
or for seating rivets.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.530
It's a metal worker's hammer.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.450
So you might not have known
about that before but now, at

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.300
least, you have a word to
hang that knowledge on.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.620
It's a ball peen hammer.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:10.059
So we have various levels here,
going from very specific

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:11.800
to very general.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.520
And we can even go to a level
of specificity for pianos by

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.770
saying we've got
a Bosendorfer.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.680
Why is a Bosendorfer special?

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.240
I mean, is it like a Baldwin?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.010
Something's [INAUDIBLE],
Yoka--

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.710
Lots of piano types,
what's special?

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.110
You see, you don't know because
unless you play the

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.290
piano, and probably unless
you're a serious piano player

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.082
you don't know that
a Bosendorfer--

00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:48.658
Ariel, you know.

00:17:48.658 --> 00:17:51.950
STUDENT: I think its supposed to
have an extra octave at the

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:52.610
bottom, black keys.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:53.600
Pretty cool.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.580
PATRICK WINSTON: It's got some
extra keys at the bottom.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.240
And most people don't know that
unless they're serious

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.350
about the piano.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:01.160
Some professional piano
players, when they're

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:04.110
confronted with a Bosendorfer
have to have someone cover

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.790
those keys because it screws
up their peripheral vision,

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.420
and hit the wrong key.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.410
Because they're not used
to having those

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.780
extra keys at the bottom.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.365
So that's a little detail
but the Bosendorfer.

00:18:15.365 --> 00:18:19.470
So you can make a kind of graph,
and you can say, let's

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:31.140
go from low, very general,
to a basic level,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.580
to a specific level.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:41.550
So it is the case in human
knowledge that that graph has

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.920
a tendency to look sort
of like this.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:53.650
So here's tool, here's hammer,
here's ball peen.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.540
So that level, where you have a
big jump, that's the general

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.840
to basic level of transition.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.070
So that basic level is probably
there because that's

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.090
the level on which we hang a
huge amount of our knowledge.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.200
We know a lot about pianos, and
it all seems to be hanging

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.070
on that word piano,
which gives us

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.980
power with the concept.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.680
So that's example number
one of an element

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.600
of our inner language.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.860
The ability to assemble things
into hierarchies like that,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.740
and hang knowledge about those
objects on the elements in

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.990
that hierarchy.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.790
Well, given that you have
elements in the hierarchy, how

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.650
do you talk about them?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.740
Well, I like to consider the
possibility, just for the sake

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.750
of illustration, that you're
thinking about a car crashing

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.750
into a wall.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.220
So you've got things to think
about like the speed of the

00:19:50.220 --> 00:20:04.705
car, the distance to the wall,
and the condition of the car.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.110
And you've got the period before
the crash, during the

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.650
crash, and after the crash.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:18.390
So you might want to think about
how to talk about those

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.725
objects in those three
time periods.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:30.410
So we can do that with a
vocabulary of change and we do

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:34.400
that because we believe that
most of human thinking is

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.360
thinking about change
causing change.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.070
And that flies in the face of
what we learned as engineers.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.995
Because in engineering, we learn
about state, and once

00:20:44.995 --> 00:20:47.900
you know the state of the
system, you know everything

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.020
you need to know in order
to predict the future.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.640
The trouble is, in our heads,
thinking about everything

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.007
there is in the world, including
the current phase of

00:20:56.007 --> 00:20:58.530
the moon, is too much stuff.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.950
So mostly, our thinking, we
think, is hinging on the idea

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.530
that change leads to change.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.620
So that's why we have a
vocabulary of change.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:14.460
So in the period before the
crash, the speed of the car is

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.090
not changing.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.600
There's a little notation for
not change, no delta.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.790
The distance to the wall,
that's decreasing.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:27.370
The condition of the car,
that's not changing.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.210
Then, the car hits the wall.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.810
So the speed of the car
disappears, the distance to

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.950
the wall disappears, and the
condition of the car will

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.010
change dramatically.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.110
Finally, after the crash is
over, the speed of the car

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.740
does not appear.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.520
The distance to the wall does
not change, and the condition

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.550
of the car also does
not change.

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.020
So that's hinting at a
vocabulary of change, and its

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.470
use, which will be the second
element in our development of

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.950
a vocabulary of ways in which we
might have constructed are

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.700
inner language.

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.800
So this a particular idea,
that's classification.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:17.930
This is transition, and a
system that purports to

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.850
understand stories with a heavy
emphasis on this notion

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.450
of transition and we believe,
that is to say, I think, that

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:31.880
that vocabulary has to have
decrease, increase, change,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.000
appear, and disappear.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.910
So there are 10 things you can
have in such diagrams.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.070
I've done five.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:47.110
That's because, for each
of those, there's a not

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.070
variation on that.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:52.270
So with a vocabulary of 10
things can go a long way

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.250
toward helping to describe
things that are in process of

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.980
change and making transition.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.200
And we have a lot of those
words in our vocabulary.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.680
We use those words a lot
in our vocabulary.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.380
They seem heavily connected
with vision.

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.700
Our friend appeared.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.580
The cat disappeared.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.910
The speed increased.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.675
So this is a description
of a crash.

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:20.430
In terms of those kinds of
elements, now, I say to you,

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.410
how does a camera work?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:31.160
Well, I could say the camera
works because a photon crashes

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.410
into a photo receptor.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.450
So when I say a photon crashes
into a photo receptors, why am

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.230
I saying that, and
how does it help?

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.890
I'm saying that and it helps
because it's the same pattern

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.390
of change you already know about
when you talk about a

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.560
car crashing into a wall.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.180
How does that work?

00:23:50.180 --> 00:24:03.790
The speed of the photon, the
distance of the photon to the

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:09.470
receptor, and the condition
of the receptor.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.720
So analogies like that are very
much of the core of what

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.700
we think about all the time.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.630
Really then, there is
representation number two.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.040
Number one is class, number two
is transition, and now,

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:33.600
you're ready for number three,
which is trajectory.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.960
Linguists, who study sentences,
often talk in terms

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.430
of fundamental patterns that
seemed to be in a lot of what

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:45.670
we say, and a lot of what we
say is about objects moving

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:46.920
along trajectories.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.375
So we can talk about
a trajectory frame.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.650
And a trajectory frame will
have elements like this.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.750
It has an object moving on a
trajectory that ends up at a

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.000
destination.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.715
You might start out
at a source.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:21.970
It's probably been arranged by
some kind of agent, and the

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.840
agent may assist himself making
the motion happen with

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.090
some kind of instrument.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.300
There might be somebody
helping out

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.030
over here, a co-agent.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:42.620
Well, what else can we have?

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.235
A beneficiary, someone is helped
out by the action.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.240
Sometimes, the motion is
arranged by a conveyance.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:12.180
So these are a lot of slots,
finite slots, and descriptions

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.460
of actions, many of which
involve motion on a

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.300
trajectory.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.650
We have a tendency in language
to decorate these things in

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.540
one way or another, depending
on the language.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.690
And so in many languages, the
decoration is by way of

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.350
position in the sentence.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.400
In English, it's often by
way of a preposition.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:39.430
It's used to help zero in on a
particular role of an object

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.550
in the trajectory scenario.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:49.110
So if I say, I baked a cake with
a friend, there's a with

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:51.040
preposition.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.750
If I baked a cake for a friend,
the friend is the

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.160
beneficiary.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.390
If I baked a cake with an oven,
that's an instrument.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:08.480
The object may be moving to a
destination from a source, and

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.460
if I'm going to New York
by train, I put a

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.080
by on top of that.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.290
If the agent isn't in subject
position, I would say

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.700
something like, oh,
I see all the work

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.520
was done by a student.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.950
So those prepositions have a
tendency to help us zoom in on

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.130
the actual role of particular
objects in this whole package,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.630
the whole frame.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.300
So this is number three.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.490
There's a variation on this
in which there's no actual

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.930
trajectory in which case we'll
just call that a role frame.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.780
Because if there's no
trajectory, we can still have

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.915
things such as an instrument, a
co-agent, and a beneficiary.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.120
So now, we've got three
representations.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.410
You might say, well,
what good are they?

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.680
And you can determine what
good they are these days

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.460
because it's easier to go over
established corpuses, and say,

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:01.700
what fraction of those, of the
sentences, in such a corpus

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:07.660
involve classification or a
transition or a trajectory.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.170
The most well known of these is
the so-called Wall Street

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:10.810
Journal Corpus.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.790
It has 50,000 sentences in it,
drawn from some period of

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:22.700
time, all the syntactical
language types work with that

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.530
corpus a great deal.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.570
And we worked with it a little
bit too, to see what fraction

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.210
of the sentences or what the
density of trajectories and

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.170
transitions are in
those sentences.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:38.010
So I have to say that a little
more carefully, because the

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:48.730
finding is that in 100 sentences
you'll find about 25

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:52.120
transitions or trajectories.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.590
So they're very densely
represented.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.270
They're often very abstract.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:05.470
Prices rose, the economy went
to someplace, but there are

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.100
still words that denote
transition or trajectory.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.800
Of course, once you have all
this stuff, that you have then

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.110
have a desire to put
it together.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:22.810
So the next thing we need to
talk about is story sequences.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:27.200
So a story sequence can be a
single sentence, and I want to

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.135
illustrate that with one
of my favorites.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.300
Here's the sentences.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.915
I think I've chosen a gender
neutral name so as not getting

00:29:50.915 --> 00:29:52.270
in any trouble.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.600
So Pat, but I don't call myself
Pat because I decided

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.570
when I was 18 years old
that pat is a unit

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.470
of measure for butter.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.550
In any case, with Pat comforted,
Mary, do you have

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:06.100
an image of what happened?

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.940
Probably not a very
firm image.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.520
You know that Pat did something,
but you don't know

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.790
exactly what.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.150
Nevertheless, when Pat comforted
Chris, you can

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:26.000
construct something that looks
like a role frame.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.930
Because the role frame for that
would have an agent, and

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.840
that would be Pat.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.090
There's an action.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.760
We're going to put a question
mark in there because we don't

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.760
have a very firm image of
what the action is.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:51.190
Then again, we're building
a wall frame, like so.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.440
The object is Chris.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.140
Oh, you know that
is the object.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.710
Is there anything
else we can say?

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.820
Oh, yes, we can probably
say something more.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.630
Something else comes to
mind when you see

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.910
Pat comforted Chris.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:23.120
There's a sort of result,
and the result is

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.370
a transition frame.

00:31:28.515 --> 00:31:36.370
And the transition frame
involves an object, which is

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:50.570
Chris, and Chris has a mood,
which presumably, is improved.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.460
It goes up.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.855
Did you have something,
Elliott?

00:31:54.855 --> 00:31:58.320
STUDENT: Could you, I guess,
analogize the Pat comforted

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.260
Chris to something like Pat gave
comfort to Chris as Chris

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.240
is the destination?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.715
And couldn't this
be [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:08.715 --> 00:32:11.550
PATRICK WINSTON: Elliott is
wandering into a very

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:14.250
interesting area having to do
with, couldn't you think about

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.860
this in another way and think
of it as something moving

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.230
along a trajectory.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.600
Comfort is moving, if not from
Pat, at least to Chris.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.610
And that's a very important kind
of observation because

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:30.220
what it would suggest is there
can be a utility in thinking

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.300
of things in multiple ways,
multiple representations.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.040
Marvin Minsky has a wonderful
aphoristic phrase, which is,

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.700
if you can only think about
something in one way, you have

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.160
no recourse when
you get stuck.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.630
So multiple representations mean
you have multiple ways of

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.340
gathering regularity from the
world, and collecting it and

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.250
therefore that'll make
you smarter.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.080
So yes, you could do that, and
that would be a compliment to

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.020
what I'm doing now.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.490
Let me continue what
I'm doing now.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.780
So what have I done?

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.720
I've got a role frame and a
tradition frame, and the

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.550
transition frame is the
target of the result

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.350
slot in the role frame.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.230
Now, we can modify this
a little bit.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.060
And maybe want to say, instead
of comforted, terrorized.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.490
And how would that
change things?

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.490
We don't know exactly
what Pat did so the

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.180
action remains unknown.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.670
The agent and the object
are the same.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.010
But the result here
is presumably that

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:49.590
the mood went down.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.550
With just what we've got so far,
we can answer a lot of

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:52.460
questions, by the way.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.010
Once we've got the sentence
understood in these terms, we

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.210
can say who did the thing?

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.030
What's this all about?

00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:59.490
And the answer is Pat.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.330
What did Pat do?

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.130
Comfort, terrorized.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.910
Who do they do it too?

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.310
Who was the object?

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.780
It's Chris.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.350
What was the result?

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.949
Chris felt better.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.260
Chris felt worse.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.639
So these representations already
give us a question and

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:22.219
answering capability that makes
for an understanding of

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.760
the sentence.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.920
But still, we haven't been very
specific, so our next

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.310
step takes this same sentence in
a more specific direction.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.770
So here's a way that goes.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.469
Kissed Chris.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:44.530
Now, you begin to get a sense of
what's going on, you form a

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.629
mental image, so you could
have a hallucination.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.870
And that hallucinations will
also be a kind of frame, but,

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.570
in this case, it'll be
a trajectory frame.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:11.475
And the object would be, I
don't know, Pat's lips.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:23.450
And the destination will
be Chris' lips.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.490
I don't know, is that right?

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.400
It depends.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.350
It depends.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.800
Have you all formed a picture
of what's going on here?

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:40.080
So it will be different
depending on whether Chris is

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:47.970
Pat's girlfriend or if Chris is
Pat's daughter or if Chris

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:53.830
is a frog and Pat is a prince
-ess, I guess, the way the

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.080
story usually goes.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.080
So somehow we have, in our
heads, all kinds of libraries

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.490
that help us to form mental
pictures of things when we see

00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:06.470
things like kissed.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.870
So one final one just
to show the variety.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.920
We could say that Pat
stabbed Chris.

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.410
What changes?

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:28.550
Let's see, in the case of
kissed, the mood is going up.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.760
In the case of stabbed, the
mood is going down.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.710
You can also probably say that
the health is going down.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.750
And the destination
is Chris' body.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.700
And the object that's moving
is Pat's knife.

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:51.460
We get the same pattern with
both of those sentences.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.060
So both of them involve a
sequence that starts off with

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.080
the action, moves to a
transition and a trajectory

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.140
and those are all arranged
in a line.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:06.790
And that line is something that
gives us a lot of power

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.460
over the situation relative
to a semantic net.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.360
So I'm going to decorate that
one more time, and say that

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.580
another element we
get out of our

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.160
internal language is sequence.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:24.110
An element we need in order to
have anything that looks like

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.510
an account of an inner
language is sequence.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.370
Because if you think about
things being arrayed in a vast

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.520
spreading network, it's hard
to deal with them.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.320
But if you thing about things
being arrayed along a line, in

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:42.490
a sequence of actions or events,
like so, then that

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.530
imposes enough constraint
to get a handle on

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.330
what's going on.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:52.050
So what we're going to call this
is the representation,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:56.100
and I guess I'm up to one,
two, three, four.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.130
This is a representation
of story sequence.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.420
so even though that's a kind of
micro-story, it's still an

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.510
example of a story sequence
because we get the power out

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.406
of it by arranging everything
in a line.

00:38:17.406 --> 00:38:20.400
You have a sense, I think,
especially if you play a

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.160
musical instrument, on how
dependent we are on sequence.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.580
So if you play a musical
instrument, you probably know

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.270
how difficult it is to start
replaying a piece of music

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:33.380
from the middle of a measure.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:35.440
You have to go back to at least
the beginning of the

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.545
measure, and probably to the
beginning of the phrase, if

00:38:37.545 --> 00:38:39.330
not the beginning
of the piece.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:43.880
So our memory seems to be, at
least in music, very rooted in

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.250
the idea of sequences.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.475
And that's often true
of storytelling too.

00:38:48.475 --> 00:38:52.100
We have to go back to the
beginning of at least a scene,

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.260
because somehow these things are
arranged in sequences that

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:03.070
form, somehow, usefulness out
of their sequentialness.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.280
So there's one more thing we can
talk about and that is the

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.920
idea of not just the idea of
how these sequences are

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.840
constructed and what they're
constructed out of, but we can

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.300
also talk a little bit in terms
of libraries of stories.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.840
And when we talk about libraries
of stories, we can

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.350
think about kind of the sort
of standard stories that we

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:36.290
have and how they're arranged,
and how we can know a lot

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.840
about something by what
it's super class is.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.770
So it's a variation on the theme
of learning stuff from

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.520
the super classes.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.840
So here's an event frame.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:54.990
And then, in addition
to event frames,

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:56.260
there's disaster frames.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.950
And then there are
party frames.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:11.010
And parties and disasters
are both events.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.520
And when we talk about
disasters, we know, in turn,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.630
they break up in a variety
of things.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:22.805
We have earthquake disasters,
and maybe we have hurricanes.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.440
And in the party world we have,
I don't know, birthday

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.300
parties, and we have weddings.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:44.920
And each of these types of
frames invites us to fill in

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.050
particular slots.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.910
So if we're reading a newspaper
story about a

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.730
wedding, we know that we're
going to be learning the same

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.870
sorts of things we will learn
about any party except there

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.790
is the additional information
that we expect that says

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:01.040
something about the bride
and the groom.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.150
If we have a raw event and we
don't know anything more about

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:14.630
it than that, there's
a time and place.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.800
If it's a disaster frame, it
gets a grizzly over here, but

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:31.080
if there's a disaster frame, we
might have the fatalities,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.800
and how much it cost.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:40.800
If it's an earthquake frame, we
need to know the magnitude

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.920
of the quake, and the
name of the fault.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:53.050
If it's a hurricane, we have
the category and the name.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:01.040
So each of these things up there
can be viewed, not just

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.690
an example of something, but as
a new frame all by itself.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.500
As we mature, we have these
first four things as building

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.470
blocks, and then, we educate
ourselves, and we get all

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.370
those kinds of frames
that help us to

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:19.290
understand the world.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:24.150
But how to fill those in from
a newspaper story can be

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.780
sometimes, quite a challenge.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.910
Actually the worst thing to
understand is children's

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:36.820
stories because, and this was
determined experimentally when

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.350
people tried to understand
children's stories, because it

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:45.450
turns out that children's
stories are not simpler than

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.540
the stories we write
for adults.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:50.550
In many cases, they're harder.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.350
If you read about Shakespearean
plots, it's all

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.360
about intrigue, murder,
jealousy, greed, but when

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.540
you're trying to write a
children's story it can be

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.300
about anything.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:08.200
And worse yet, the children's
story often raises problems

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.830
that you don't see in
newspaper stories.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.080
Let me illustrate
that for you.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.560
You want to read that story?

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:27.670
You have no trouble figuring it
out, of course, but think

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:30.090
about a poor machine.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.570
It's struggling to understand
anything.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.820
What's going to be
the problem?

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.700
It's going to have trouble
figuring out those pronoun

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.480
antecedents.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:39.990
Look at them.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.240
They're complicated.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.000
PATRICK WINSTON: Shut
[INAUDIBLE].

00:43:51.755 --> 00:43:53.005
Oh, that's the way.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.210
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:03.000
Here are the pronouns.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.940
One of them wanted
to buy a kite.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:07.240
He has one, he said.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:10.230
He will make you take it back.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.030
So that's pretty hard.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:14.790
Actually, the principal here
that I'm driving at is, when

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.750
you have a new story or any
story, if you have an old

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.080
story but you want to read
it-- when you want to

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.350
understand it quickly, the
instantiation of it quickly,

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:26.980
you need to be sure that, if
you're the storyteller, you

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.650
don't add to the burden of the
understanding any syntactic

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:30.840
difficulty.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.790
So that's an example of
telling a story with

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.470
additional syntactic
difficulty.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:39.360
No newspaper journalist
would ever write

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.000
the story like that.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.790
Here's how they would
write it.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.130
They would even give you a
clue that there's certain

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.720
information you're never
going to get, like

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.600
who told the story.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.070
It's that reliable
sources business.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.550
So this brings us to the final
bit that I want to deal with

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.150
today, and what I'm going to do
is, if you came into this

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:09.660
class today as a 97 pound
writing weakling, you're about

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:14.730
to emerge as a 250 pound
mountain of a writer.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.630
Because I want to tell you a few
tricks that will make you

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.540
usually better as a writer,
especially if

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:25.200
you're Russian or German.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.120
And here's how it works.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.370
Rule one.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.640
Because they place additional
syntactic burden on the

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.520
understanding of the story
by the reader.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.450
So if you're telling somebody
about some difficult new

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.740
technical idea, the last thing
you want them to do is to

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.990
burden their syntactic processor
with figuring out

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.040
pronoun antecedents.

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.240
So don't use pronouns in you're
writing, technical

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.800
writing, at least, will
be much clearer.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.490
By the way, why does this
especially apply to Germans

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.230
and Russians?

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:11.980
Is it because--

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:14.900
is this an ethnic origin
slur or is this a

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.310
fact about their language?

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.370
It's a fact about
their language.

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.380
Where is the fact?

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.570
Why can they get away with
pronoun usages that we cannot

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.910
get away with in English?

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:26.470
Yes, Andrew?

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.802
STUDENT: Gender and also--

00:46:29.802 --> 00:46:35.240
PATRICK WINSTON: Gender, because
if you have all of

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.530
your nouns decorated with
gender, that reduces by three,

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.960
the potential for ambiguity
in the pronoun antecedent.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.540
So you'll frequently find that
German and Russian writers

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.970
will have pronouns all over the
place that are perfectly

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.930
clear to them because
of gender.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:55.170
They are interpretable by
English speakers when

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.890
translated because we don't
have the gender to

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.720
help us zero in.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.890
So these things all have to
do with minimizing extra,

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:06.170
superfluous, gratuitous,
unnecessary

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:07.330
burden on the reader.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:13.775
Number two is don't use
former or latter.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.660
You see those words used
frequently in technical

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.310
writing, and guess what?

00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:24.400
No human being ever encounters
those words without having to

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:28.370
stop and go back to figure out
what they refer to it.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.970
So that's another example of
not placing any unnecessary

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.370
syntactic burden
on the reader.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:41.500
And finally, don't call
a shovel a spade.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.680
There's a habit, probably
instilled by well-meaning but

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.500
misadvised high school teachers,
that you shouldn't

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.530
repeat words, and so people go
to great lengths to use some

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:54.830
different word.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.640
The problem is that the reader
doesn't know if the shift in

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.640
the word is deliberate and
attached to some subtle

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.320
meaning shift, or if it's just
adhering to some high school

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.720
teacher's admonition against
using the same word again.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.540
So you don't want to say, oh,
the right way to dig this

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:15.230
particular hole is with a spade
and then switch to a

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.350
shovel because the reader can't
tell if it's deliberate,

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.840
accidental, or a consequence of
just the desire not to use

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.450
the same word.

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:28.510
So this is how you, with some
very simple mechanisms

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.660
grounded in AI, you can actually
make yourself into a

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:33.280
better writer by avoiding those
kinds of things that put

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.700
an unnecessary syntactic burden
on the people who are

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.950
reading your stuff.
