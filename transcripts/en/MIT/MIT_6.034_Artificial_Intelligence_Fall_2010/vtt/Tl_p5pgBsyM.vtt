00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.210
PROFESSOR: This week's
problem is from the 2008 quiz

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.710
one on search.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
It is motivated by the search of
evil overlord, Mark Vader, who

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.780
is shopping for a
new evil stronghold.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.720
He starts from his
current stronghold,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.450
which is S, the
Depth-First Search Star.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.420
Now the Depth-First Search Star
has the following qualities.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.530
It has a small, thermal
Exhaust Pipe Weakness.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.240
It has the quality
of That's No Moon,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.870
but it does not have a
Race of Enslaved Minions,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.240
or a Secret Escape Route,
or Sharks with Laser Beams.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.360
Now when I originally
wrote this problem in 2008,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.810
there was another quality
that very important.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.060
It was a giant Laser, and it
did have that property, as did

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.470
Dr. Evil's Moon Base,
but that was removed

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.710
to make it easier to solve.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.110
So we're going to solve it
without the giant laser,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.520
that we can just have the
Sharks with Laser Beams.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:21.030
So Mark Vader has gone to
Ackbar's Emporium of New Evil

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.260
Strongholds, which are
listed on the left,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.420
and he's trying to
figure out the best

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.160
way to get from his
current stronghold

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.290
to his goal stronghold,
the 603 Fortress, which

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.170
has the admirable qualities of
no small thermal Exhaust Pipe

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.980
Weakness, and it still
has That's No Moon.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.660
It has a Race of
Enslaved Minions,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.480
and a Secret Escape Route,
and Sharks with Laser Beams.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.640
So it's got everything you
would want and no weakness.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.120
However, he can only move
between fortresses that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.430
have exactly one difference.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.980
Fortunately, Mark remembers
how to perform the search

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.810
techniques he learned in
6.034 from his mentor, Emperor

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.140
Palpatine.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.040
So we've got several
fortresses here.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.980
We've got the
Depth-First Search Star.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.070
We've also got
Shaoul Ghoul, which

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.510
has the qualities,
basically, of That's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.620
No Moon, and none of
the other qualities.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.740
Dol Guldur here, has got the
Exhaust Pipe Weakness somehow,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.450
despite being
Sauron's stronghold.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.630
It's not a moon, and it
has those enslaved minions.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.120
I guess the Orcs are enslaved.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.565
Moonraker, here, only has
the Exhaust Pipe Weakness,

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:35.230
so it's not very good.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.100
But James Bond didn't
need to deal with stuff.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.340
Zeal Underwater
Palace has That's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.760
No Moon and a
Secret Escape Route.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.750
Zeromus' Lunar Core has
an Exhaust Pipe Weakness

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.620
and a Race of Enslaved Minions.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.950
Whalers of the Moon Ride has
the Exhaust Pipe Weakness,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.980
Race of Enslaved Minions,
and Sharks with Laser Beams.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.730
6.03 Fortress we've
already been over.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.640
Atlantis has all qualities
except for a Secret Escape

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.350
Route.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.230
Willy Wonka's Factory
has some of everything.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.240
It is, after all,
Willy Wonka's Factory.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.012
Highlight, the Race of Enslaved
Minions, the Oompa Loompas.

00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:14.620
And Dr. Evil's Moon
Base is only missing

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.860
That's No Moon, because it is a
moon, because it's a moon base.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970
So if you got all
the references that

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.114
were used in making those
fortresses, I'm sorry.

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:28.488
There's nothing
I can do for you.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.920
Now, Mark, being a
clever evil overlord,

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.540
realizes that he can produce
a graph of the exploration

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.510
choices with edges
joining strongholds that

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.160
differ by just one feature.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.150
So although this
is a graph here,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.380
as Patrick often says-- and you
get to hear again right now--

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.720
search is about choice,
not just about maps.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.450
So we're not moving around
anywhere in the real world,

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.080
but we certainly are
going to move around

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.200
this graph to pick between
these many stronghold choices.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.010
How can we decide
where to travel?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.660
Well, we're about to find out.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.730
So we've got this
lovely graph right here,

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.980
and now we're going to get
to do depth-first search

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.019
on the graph.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.550
Now there's a lot of
ways to do search,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.410
and you've seen
Patrick do it, you

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.710
may have seen some people
do it in recitation.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.650
And I'm going to offer you guys
a unique opportunity to see me

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.650
do search in one of several
ways, or possibly more.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.920
I have the tried
and true method.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.870
You have the queue,
or agenda, or whatever

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.930
you want to call it.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.970
You keep track of
it at every level.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.560
You make damn sure that
everything you're doing

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.180
is right.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.340
It takes a long time, and
you get the answer right.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.170
Or there's one where you
only work with the goal tree,

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.920
and you draw it really fast,
and you might make a mistake,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.070
but it's going to
solve it more quickly.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.310
So who would rather see the
reliable, but slower, approach?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.271
Who would rather see the faster,
but less reliable, approach?

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:06.770
All right.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.917
Monte Carlo people here,
rather than Las Vegas.

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:10.500
If you don't know
what that is, you'll

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.200
learn it in algorithms class.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.750
All right.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.520
Then there's a third
approach that I probably

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.853
won't show you unless there's
overwhelming favor for it.

00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:19.390
That is the approach
that is manically fast

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.670
and will solve depth-first
search in no time at all,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.560
but it is very likely
to make mistakes.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.310
That is the approach
that I use when

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.800
solving depth-first search.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.466
I've used it enough times that I
don't make mistakes that often,

00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:31.910
but even I still do.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.480
So does anyone want
to see that one?

00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:36.240
OK.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.530
Not that many people.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.650
Well, it doesn't take
much time, but I'm

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.722
just afraid that if I show it
you, that you'll be like, ooh,

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:41.930
that's the only way to do it.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.370
So we'll save that for
later if we have more time.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.690
It essentially, for people
that are interested,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.010
involves just using
your chalk or finger

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.820
to trace through
the tree really fast

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.440
and figure out what it's doing
by drawing little tiny lines.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.540
It is very fast, but
it's not very accurate.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.230
And you have shown, basically,
no work if you get it wrong,

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.800
so shame on you.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.237
OK.

00:06:06.237 --> 00:06:07.820
Well, let's do the
somewhat faster way

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.270
where we don't draw
out the entire agenda,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.980
and then people who were
the almost nobody who

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.670
raised their hand for
that way can check it out

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.342
in tutorial the way that
you do it using the agenda.

00:06:18.342 --> 00:06:19.800
So let's do it
using the goal tree.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.620
So it's a bit faster that way.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.922
So we're going to start,
starting at S, the start node,

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:26.480
and going to G, the goal node.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.376
That's a standard
notation, but make sure

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.750
that when you're
taking the test,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.920
you check to make sure
where the start node is,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.900
where the goal node is.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.780
It's pretty much an
asshole move to have

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.416
a G node that isn't
the goal node,

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.040
but sometimes there
won't be an S node.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.914
That's a pretty good
clue that something else

00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:46.250
is the start node.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.650
Now there's a few little
white star ideas that we have,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.080
or silver star
ideas, for search.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.870
One is lexicography.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.940
What it lexicography?

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.640
Who cares?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.330
Well, the most famous
lexicographer I know of

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.220
is Samuel Johnson, who wrote
a really famous dictionary.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.480
And the only reason we
care about it in this class

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.060
is because you'll always
see the instructions "break

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.560
ties in lexicographic order."

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.900
And then you might
be like, wow, that's

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.680
really rather a wordy word,
or a sesquipedalion word,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.239
or whatever really long word
you want to use to describe

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:19.280
the word "lexicographic."

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.860
What the heck does it mean?

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.040
Basically, it means
alphabetical order,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.670
like you would do
in a dictionary.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.730
So for instance, in alphabetical
order, A comes before B.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.310
So you would go to A before
B. No, even beyond that point,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.450
there's several ways to do
a lexicographic tiebreak.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.220
And it's not always
consistent between algorithms

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.830
how you would do a
lexicographic tiebreaker.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.410
In the most recent
time that Patrick

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.700
was kind of randomly
talking to the staff,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.600
he made it clear that the way
he would like us to do it,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.000
and therefore, the way
we'd like you to do it,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.347
is to tiebreak based on the
very latest nodes at the end.

00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:01.430
So you might say, that's
not really lexicographic.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.105
Wouldn't SAB come before
SGA in the dictionary?

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.980
And my answer to you
is, yes, it would.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.180
Yes, yes, it definitely would.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:24.682
However, that is
apparently what we're

00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:26.890
doing, according to the last
thing that Patrick said,

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.030
and we will keep you
updated if he decides

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.960
to go back to dictionary order.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.260
So that's lexicography.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
You might be wondering
what the picture here is.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.720
Well, this is our
friend, the ouroboros.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.840
Long has it been a
symbol in alchemy

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.350
of infinity, eternity, or
maybe a sort of infinite energy

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.680
engine, turning iron into gold.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.900
But today, unfortunately,
the ouroboros

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:02.100
is an endangered species
because no biting your own tail

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.860
in 6.034.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.630
A lot of people
mess up from this.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.550
It's an honest mistake.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.034
I mean, we've gotten some
emails from staff members who

00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:12.450
couldn't solve one
of the problems

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.741
because they forgot about this.

00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:16.870
So it's OK if you forget, but
try your best to remember.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.520
No biting your own tail
is the only smart thing

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.360
our system does.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.540
You'll remember last week when
we were talking about rules,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.090
and we were saying that the rule
system is not a smart creature.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.631
It doesn't know that
"not Polly is dead"

00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:35.380
should be the same as
"Polly is not dead",

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.338
or something like that.

00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:38.990
It's too dumb to
figure that out.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.230
Well, this system is also
dumb, but one thing it knows

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.800
is that Patrick really hates
if the same node appears twice

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.010
within the same path.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.210
And it will destroy
that immediately,

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.330
before even adding
it to the queue.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:53.860
It's gone.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.090
It's not considered.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.920
It's out of there.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.320
So very important,
sad ouroboros,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.740
no biting your own tail.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:03.419
All right.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:04.960
So now that I've
gotten through that,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.130
let's actually solve the problem
with some depth-first search.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.020
How will we do that?

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.436
Well, we're not going to use
the queue, as popular demand,

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:12.820
we're going to use a goal tree.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:19.560
So we'll start at node S. What
are our choices at node S?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.850
Well, I'm going to
force you guys to help.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.020
So it won't be quite as
fast, but it'll be fun.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.566
So what are our
choices at node S?

00:10:28.566 --> 00:10:29.065
You.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.771
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:31.685
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:31.685 --> 00:10:33.520
AUDIENCE: A or B?

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.370
PROFESSOR: Not quite,
and this is something

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.510
I like about this problem.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:37.680
You got most of them.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.040
Do you see that there
might be another choice?

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:41.560
Everyone?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.730
Yeah, C. This is
a big problem that

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.870
has happened on a few different
quiz problems where there's

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.334
a sort of a grid that
looks like a tree,

00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.000
or a graph that looks
like a tree, where

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.210
people aren't as willing to
go up as they are to go down.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.090
You can see it on some of the
other past quiz problems too.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.780
Make sure that you
check the connectivity,

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.570
and also note that unless
otherwise specified--

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:10.250
and I don't think we've really
done this much-- the little

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.390
connecting edges in our
graphs are bidirectional.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.320
You'll see a big
arrow, and probably

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.050
instructions written at
least eight font sizes higher

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.570
than all the rest
of them, and bold,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.610
if we're going to do something
different for this quiz.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.240
It happens that they
do it sometimes,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.140
where I'll just say in
recitation, we never do this.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.515
And then on the
quiz, they do it.

00:11:27.515 --> 00:11:31.050
But it will be in giant bold
letters, which also leads me

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.960
to another silver star
idea that I forgot

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.085
to tell you guys last week.

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:35.727
So I hope people
didn't ditch out on me,

00:11:35.727 --> 00:11:36.670
like, oh, Mark's boring.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.670
We won't come next week.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.380
And then miss this one because
it just came to my mind.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.975
That is, read the instructions.

00:11:42.975 --> 00:11:45.410
It is a very important
thing for the quizzes,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.140
and Patrick will,
in a later lecture,

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.170
tell you guys, ask
why five times,

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.430
and he'll explain why
that's a gold star idea.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.880
My parallel to this is read
the instructions five times.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.580
Maybe not five, maybe three
or four, but at least three.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.020
Read the instructions.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.139
Read them again.

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.180
Then read them a third
time only paying attention

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.690
to whatever is bold
and eight sizes larger

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.370
than all the other ones, cause
there's going to be something

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.680
there that's that size.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.800
And it going to be the
thing that everyone misses.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.750
So make sure you're
not everyone,

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.140
and you read the
instructions a lot of times.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.990
But anyway, so yeah,
we've got it right.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.140
S goes to A, B, and C. OK.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.070
We're looking at A, B,
and C as possibilities.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.110
Everyone, help me make the
lexicographic tiebreak.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.140
Where do we go?

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.760
AUDIENCE: A.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.885
PROFESSOR: A. That's right.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.129
Actually, I'll call on
you guys for other ones,

00:12:40.129 --> 00:12:41.670
but that first step
is pretty simple.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.390
We could have everyone
do it together.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.100
Everyone, A only leads to?

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.890
AUDIENCE: D.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.890
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.232
Why doesn't it
lead to S as well?

00:12:49.232 --> 00:12:50.642
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:12:50.642 --> 00:12:52.100
PROFESSOR: No biting
your own tail.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.020
Everyone's right.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.980
Good job, everyone.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:54.480
All right.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.460
S leads to these three.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.060
You go to A, go to D. Dead end.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.955
Backtrack.

00:13:01.955 --> 00:13:02.455
OK.

00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:04.760
When we backtrack,
we backtrack up to A.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.450
There's no other children.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.040
We backtrack up to S.
Where will we go now?

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.540
AUDIENCE: B.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.110
PROFESSOR: B. It's the
next one alphabetically.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.800
All right.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.290
B can't go to S,
so it only goes to?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.175
AUDIENCE: H.

00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:15.800
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.300
When we're at H, we can go to?

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.440
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.380
PROFESSOR: F or I. That's right.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.685
You guys get this.

00:13:22.685 --> 00:13:24.140
Depth-first search is easy.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.080
All right.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.900
But we choose?

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.080
F. That's right.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.750
When we're at F, we can go to?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.450
E and J. That's right.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.030
We'll choose?

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.650
E. When we're at
E, we can go to?

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.610
We can go to C. It's not
on this particular path.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.300
People are correct when
they say C. When we go to C,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.680
we can go to nowhere.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.280
We're dead.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.350
Backtrack.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.230
We backtrack.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.800
We can't do anything
at E. We go to F.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.380
Now I forgot to tell you guys,
but this is an important note.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.920
Someone's going
to get this wrong.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.200
It's going to be one of you.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.410
Look around you, all
through the room.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:05.730
At least one of you
is going to do this.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.650
So, now I'm going to
tell you not to do this,

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.020
and then hopefully,
that will still

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.350
be true, but for fewer people.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.550
When I went to D, and then I
backtracked, and I went to S,

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.870
how many times did I backtrack?

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.760
Once.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.016
I backtracked once.

00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:23.390
This would have
been more obvious

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.490
if we were doing the
really slow boring agenda

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:31.990
way, or queue way, because
when we got to SAD,

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.810
and we expanded it, and
there was nothing left,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.380
we throw it off the
top of the queue,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.963
and go to the next
thing on the queue.

00:14:37.963 --> 00:14:40.130
And it turns out the next
thing on the queue is SB.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.449
That step was only taken once.

00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.490
Since we're using the goal
tree, which is faster,

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:47.760
it looked like we did
two, but we didn't.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.177
And if you use the queue, you'll
see that because it'll go S,

00:14:51.177 --> 00:14:52.510
and then we expand that, SASBSC.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.690
SBIC OK.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:54.430
We expand SA.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.990
SADSBSC.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.740
We expand SAD.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.550
It's dead.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.660
SBSC.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.540
One backtrack.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.930
We're back at SB.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.650
So, so far we've
done two, not four.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.980
It's pretty intuitive to
say that you did two there.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.160
It turns out you didn't
because of the algorithm that's

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.820
backing what lets us do
this goal tree search.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.824
So try to make sure you're
not the one who says two.

00:15:19.824 --> 00:15:21.240
And I, on the other
hand, will try

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.870
to make sure that we don't take
off too many points if you do.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:25.370
Question?

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.178
AUDIENCE: So any time
you backtrack, regardless

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.760
of how much it chains,
any backtracking

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.945
is just considered once.

00:15:32.945 --> 00:15:36.580
PROFESSOR: It is always going
to be considered one step.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.740
It's possible to backtrack
two times in a row.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.930
Like, if B didn't go
to anything, instead

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.420
of going to H, then we
might backtrack twice

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.370
before we got to SC.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.853
Generally, anytime you draw
a swizzle, if you're like me,

00:15:47.853 --> 00:15:49.853
and you draw a swizzle--
I suggest the swizzles.

00:15:49.853 --> 00:15:51.570
They're very nice little things.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.980
But any time you draw a
swizzle on your graph,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.450
you have backtracked once.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.750
You could even write
BT next to the swizzle,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.270
and go back and count those,
or even just count the swizzles

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:01.940
at the end.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.719
You've got it.

00:16:02.719 --> 00:16:03.510
You got the answer.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.009
Because they often ask, how
many times have you backtracked?

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:09.330
All right.

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.590
So good questions, everyone.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.740
So anyway, we backtracked from
C. Nothing at E. We go back.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.460
We were at F. So
we were at SBHF.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.090
We go to J. It's
the only choice.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:23.180
At J, we can only go to?

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:23.680
AUDIENCE: I.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.140
PROFESSOR: And at I,
we can only go to?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.000
And we win.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.950
It's not an optimal search,
so as soon as we see anything

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.450
with a G on the queue, boom.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.310
Winner.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.020
All right.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.960
And we're done.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.830
We did it.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.342
That wasn't too bad.

00:16:40.342 --> 00:16:42.550
For those of you who are
vaguely interested in seeing

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.254
how I would do it the
really super fast way,

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.420
it goes something like this.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:46.850
All right.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.400
ABC.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.520
A comes first.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.361
Only D. Backtrack.

00:16:51.361 --> 00:16:51.860
All right.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.360
B comes first.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.630
H. F comes first.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.160
E. C. Nothing.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:57.660
Backtrack.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.222
We came that way.

00:17:01.222 --> 00:17:01.722
JIG.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.940
So that's the really fast
way to do depth-first search.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.950
Don't do that, kids.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.880
We don't like--
well, maybe you can.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.380
If you get it right,
we're not going

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.349
to take off points usually.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.720
Generally, when we say
draw the goal tree below,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.250
it's just assigned
partial credit.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.990
However, we are pretty
strict about that.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.660
If anything is wrong,
except for maybe, like, OK,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.510
you write everything exactly
right, and forget G at the end.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.760
If anything that's not
completely understandable

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.070
is wrong, you will probably
lose all of the points,

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.450
and it'll be a lot of points if
you don't draw the goal tree.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.950
I will emphasize drawing the
goal tree is a good idea.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:42.450
All right.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.130
So now let's do a
breadth-first search.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.740
Before we do the breadth-first
search on this tree,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.800
I will tell you guys that
there is also a fast way

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.550
to do the breadth-first
search which is less risky,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.280
and it really depends
on how nice they

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.012
are about what they ask for.

00:18:01.012 --> 00:18:02.970
In this case, the
breadth-first search question

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.100
asks, what path does Mark find
using breadth-first search?

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.710
Rather than saying,
what nodes does

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.065
he expand in order,
or anything like that.

00:18:10.065 --> 00:18:11.350
That is important.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.010
If that question
is asked you, there

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.354
is a trick that will let you
solve it very, very quickly.

00:18:17.354 --> 00:18:19.020
In fact, faster than
depth-first search.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.030
You can solve it by inspection
in about 30 seconds.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.890
Does anyone know
what the answer is?

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:24.924
What path did he find?

00:18:24.924 --> 00:18:26.307
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:18:26.307 --> 00:18:27.390
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.390
So the answer is?

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.173
On this graph, the answer is?

00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:32.640
AUDIENCE: SBHIG.

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.870
PROFESSOR: SBHIG.

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:34.690
That's the answer.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.400
You would have your five points.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.660
Did people see that?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.305
It doesn't always work, so we're
going to actually solve it.

00:18:41.305 --> 00:18:42.930
But did everyone see
that sometimes you

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.221
can get away with not doing it?

00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:46.320
Because breadth-first
search is guaranteed

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.040
to give you the path, as we
heard correctly, with the least

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.377
number of jumps, and if there
are more than one that tie

00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:55.960
with the least number of jumps,
you can just lexicographically

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.470
figure it out, in this case
with actual dictionary order.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.320
But SBHIG is the only one.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.500
Let's do an actual
breadth-first search though,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.680
so we can feel better
about ourselves.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.370
OK.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:15.430
So you've got S, and S goes
to, as we saw before, ABC.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.040
Maybe that doesn't have
to go quite so high.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.590
All right.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.440
As we saw before, S goes to ABC.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.910
And you already told
me that A goes to D,

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.820
and you told me that B goes
to H. But what does C go to?

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.830
E. That's right.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.260
As you can see,
we're expanding it

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.170
level by level, left to right.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.080
All right.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:45.260
So SAD, were does SAD go to?

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.950
SAD goes to nowhere.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.300
It's dead.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.580
SBH.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.090
Now, wait.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.298
You might say, wait a minute.

00:19:51.298 --> 00:19:53.490
Patrick said that we're
using this weird dictionary

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.560
order where E is at the end
that comes before H. That's

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.281
our tiebreak order,
but it turns out

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.280
that breadth-first search
and depth-first search

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.677
don't sort in any way.

00:20:03.677 --> 00:20:04.510
It's very important.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.830
They don't sort the paths that
are currently on the queue.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.490
So you're going to just go
left to right, left to right,

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.300
left to right.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.752
And only at each node are
you going to break ties

00:20:15.752 --> 00:20:16.710
in lexicographic order.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:17.820
All right?

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:19.080
So SBH.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:26.112
H goes to, as we already
know, F and I. E, we

00:20:26.112 --> 00:20:27.570
think we already
know, but we don't

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.903
quite because this is E coming
from the other direction.

00:20:29.903 --> 00:20:32.027
E, this time goes
to F. That's right.

00:20:32.027 --> 00:20:33.860
Well, actually, you
guys do already know it.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:34.170
All right.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:34.860
Great.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.430
Now we come over here.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:42.610
HF goes to, as we
already know, E and J.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:50.865
I goes to, as we don't already
know, HI goes to G and J.

00:20:50.865 --> 00:20:51.555
That's right.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.911
And as it turns out, by
an implementation detail,

00:20:58.911 --> 00:20:59.410
we're done.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.570
Questions?

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.710
Does it not expand depth at all?

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.290
Now this is an
implementation detail.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.620
It's perfectly
sane and reasonable

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.250
to make a breadth-first
search that

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.937
likes to finish its entire
level that it's working on.

00:21:14.937 --> 00:21:16.520
However, in our
implementation, and we

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.769
would have seen this if we
had been pedantic and drawn

00:21:18.769 --> 00:21:20.790
out the entire queue--
that's another reason why

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.700
drawing out the entire queue
is, as I said, more reliable.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.480
In our implementation, since
it's not an optimal search,

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.630
the moment anywhere
on the queue,

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:33.187
you add something with a
G at the end, you finish.

00:21:33.187 --> 00:21:35.770
And because of the fact that the
way breadth-first search does

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.020
its mojo, is that
it adds everything

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.060
to the end of the queue.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.990
That's how it does it
level by level, right?

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.365
It adds it to the end of the
queue, instead of the front.

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:47.426
Well, then you'll add it
to the end of the queue,

00:21:47.426 --> 00:21:49.425
and then you will have
it on the queue with a G.

00:21:49.425 --> 00:21:51.150
So you won't have to do SCEF.

00:21:53.887 --> 00:21:54.595
Another question?

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:57.101
AUDIENCE: I'm just wondering,
so the breadth-first search,

00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:00.686
there was no backtracking
[INAUDIBLE] had no other--

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.190
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.200
That's a good question.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.800
So the question was, so for
the breadth-first search,

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.370
there was no backtracking.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:09.960
D died.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.470
Why didn't we
backtrack or something?

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.640
The answer to that one is,
for breadth-first search,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.410
backtracking doesn't really,
it isn't really a thing,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:20.980
like it is for
depth-first search.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.260
Why?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.740
Well, because
breadth-first search,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:27.040
we're sending our infinite
monkeys down every path.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.396
In depth-first search,
we're really focused in now.

00:22:29.396 --> 00:22:30.770
We're like, we
want to get there.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.220
We want to get there.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:32.910
Ooh, this way, this
way, this way, this way.

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.326
And might have
gone the wrong way,

00:22:34.326 --> 00:22:36.410
and then we hit a dead
end, we're like, oh, crap.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:37.580
And we go backwards.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:39.950
But for breadth-first
search, we really

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.100
are like an evil overlord.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.150
And we're like Mark Vader
saying, storm troopers,

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.600
go every direction.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.320
And then from there, go
every other direction.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.920
And so, even though, yes, when
we got to D, some of the storm

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.319
troopers hit a dead end, and
probably it was reflective,

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:55.360
and they shot it, and hit
themselves or something

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.530
like that.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.280
Meanwhile, the storm
troopers we sent to B

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.185
and C are still fine, so
we don't need to backtrack.

00:23:00.185 --> 00:23:01.630
AUDIENCE: Cause there are,
like, other troops going down

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:02.340
the tree.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there are
other troops going down

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.670
the tree in every direction.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.086
Whereas in the
depth-first search,

00:23:06.086 --> 00:23:08.250
we only sent-- we were
like, there are definitely

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.902
no droids on this escape pod.

00:23:09.902 --> 00:23:11.485
Send everyone this
straight direction,

00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:13.510
and we only sent
them to A and D.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.310
And then, so we had to backtrack
because we hit a dead end.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.560
Does that make sense?

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.864
Another question?

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:19.739
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.540
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
in this breadth-first search,

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.570
did lexicographic order
ever come into play?

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.360
The answer is yes, in a
very subtle and sneaky way.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.520
Which is, I wrote E before
J, F before I, and G

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.290
before J. If I was not
using lexicographic order,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:40.969
it might have been
reasonable to write,

00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:42.510
for instance, when
I was expanding I,

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.570
to write J before G because
J was higher up on the tree

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.850
or something like that.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.640
But the only way
it came into play

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.280
is that I wrote them left to
right in alphabetical order

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.890
every time, and I wrote ABC.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.023
Another question?

00:23:56.023 --> 00:23:57.472
AUDIENCE: We see
the F node twice.

00:23:57.472 --> 00:23:59.722
Suppose that the goal node
wasn't reached [INAUDIBLE],

00:23:59.722 --> 00:24:01.356
then you would have
visited F again.

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:03.230
PROFESSOR: And we would
have visited F again.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.855
That's correct.

00:24:03.855 --> 00:24:06.760
The question is,
F is listed twice.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.500
So if we hadn't
reached the goal node,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.990
let's say that down
there, after I is Z,

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.740
and after Z is the
goal node, then

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.990
would we have visited F again?

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.880
The answer is yes.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.920
As I said, this is the
approach that throws

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.490
your troops every possible way.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.005
So there's storm troopers
going from E to F,

00:24:21.005 --> 00:24:22.550
and there's storm troopers
going from H to F,

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.900
and they're going everywhere.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.100
Now there is a way
to cut down on this.

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.040
You could do breadth-first
search with an extended list.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.970
If you did do
breadth-first search

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.980
with an extended
list, that would

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.520
be sort of equivalent to as
soon as you expand one node,

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.020
as soon you send storm troopers
out of I to look at G and J,

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.520
one of them stays at I, and if
any other storm troopers come

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.874
to I, and they're like, we
want to see what's past I,

00:24:44.874 --> 00:24:45.790
he's like, no, no, no.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.260
We've already sent troops
past I. We've got this.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.370
Go back home.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:50.900
It's OK.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:52.700
There are no rebels
here, but it might

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.480
be Han Solo dressed
up as a storm trooper,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.570
as we'll see in
the next problem.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.530
Where our extended
list screws us over.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.440
But for this problem,
do you see what I mean?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.200
With an extended list,
we could avoid this

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.880
because the extended
list basically

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.260
says, once I've expanded
and searched past here,

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.590
don't do it again.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.300
But if you don't have one,
yeah, you'll do F twice.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.572
In fact, didn't we do
something twice here?

00:25:15.572 --> 00:25:16.850
Oh, it turns out we didn't.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.480
But we easily could have.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.620
We almost did E twice.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.710
We almost did F twice.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:24.980
It turns out we didn't,
but we could have.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.177
Another question?

00:25:26.177 --> 00:25:29.159
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for the
implementation of the queue

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:33.632
that when you expand
I, that both G and J

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:39.596
were added simultaneously
and in lexicographic order?

00:25:39.596 --> 00:25:43.572
Or is there a piece where it
would be [INAUDIBLE] order,

00:25:43.572 --> 00:25:46.965
G got added before J, so
hence, it stopped [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:46.965 --> 00:25:47.548
PROFESSOR: Ha.

00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:50.670
That is a very good question
that provokes a minor change.

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.620
The question is,
when you expand SBHI,

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.427
is SBHIG added
before SBHIJ because

00:25:58.427 --> 00:26:00.010
of lexicographic
ordering, or are they

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.650
both added at the same time?

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.480
The answer is, simultaneous.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.530
When you do the
expansion, you instantly

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.110
receive say, a list maybe, or
whatever data structure you

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.660
like, containing
all of the children,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.440
and they get appended to
the queue at once in order.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.080
So you will receive all of them.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.330
I suppose you could create
some kind of search problem

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.065
where you have, like, an
adversary node, like a wumpus,

00:26:24.065 --> 00:26:25.190
or you're hunting a wumpus.

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.085
And if you don't want to add
the exact wumpus to your search

00:26:28.085 --> 00:26:29.010
tree, or you lose.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.999
You only want to add the
one next to the wumpus.

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:32.540
I don't know.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.630
I'm making this up.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.890
And unfortunately,
you would have

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.630
to add all the children at once.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.200
Our current algorithm does
not add one at a time.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.700
All right.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.420
So we've done a
breadth-first search.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:44.940
Great.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.530
Now we're going to do
some optimal search.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.790
That is going to
require me to draw

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.510
a slightly different graph.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.050
I will draw it on what is
left of the bottom here.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.620
And then we'll solve it on what
is left of the bottom here.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.120
All right.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.910
Mark has his new
stronghold, and he wants

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.070
to invade parallel universes.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.450
Now he's programmed
his evil supercomputer

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.960
to find the shortest
path of jumps

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.085
from his starting universe
to the goal universe,

00:27:14.085 --> 00:27:18.920
G. It takes a certain
amount of energy

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.410
to move from
universe to universe

00:27:20.410 --> 00:27:23.250
based on the differing factors
between those universes.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.290
Like maybe in one
universe, a butterfly

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:31.370
didn't flap its wings in China,
whereas in the other universe,

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.480
sentient reptiles
rule the earth.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.170
And so, Mark's
supercomputer has tried

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.890
to create a heuristic
value that determines

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.970
how different the universes
are to guess, sort of, how

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.520
much energy it's going to
take to get from his start

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.550
universe, S, to his
goal universe, G,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:53.080
given that currently his armies
are at a particular universe.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.870
In other words, OK, it's
not A you put in search,

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.520
but dammit, we're going
to have a heuristic

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.590
distance to the goal.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.710
And we're going to have
a graph with distances.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:06.660
So let's see what it looks like.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.310
All right.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.960
And down here is G. So this
otherwise unassuming heart

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.800
shape hides an evil
invasion force.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.640
So let's see.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.146
The distance here is 100.

00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:48.275
The distance here is 3, 4.

00:28:48.275 --> 00:28:50.600
The distance here is 4.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:29:00.890
The distance here is
50, 50, 14, 4, 16, 16.

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.430
Oh sorry, these are connected.

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.410
30 and 10.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:15.680
The heuristic values are 0
at the start node, 50 at B,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:38.290
60 at A, 55 at C, 50
at D, 56 at E, 50 at F,

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:43.760
0 at G because it's
the goal node, 39 at H.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.145
I'll draw the little H smaller.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.030
And 0 at I. Well, after all, I
goes right to G. It can be 0.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.936
It'll be great.

00:29:55.936 --> 00:29:56.436
OK.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.020
Now, this time Mark is
trying to conserve the energy

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.700
of his parallel universe jump.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.150
That, understandably,
takes a lot of energy.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.180
So he needs to program
in the shortest

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.431
number of universe jumps that
will get him to the goal.

00:30:13.431 --> 00:30:15.180
He doesn't mean the
least number of jumps.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.305
He means the least amount
of energy on these edges.

00:30:17.305 --> 00:30:19.926
He's not interested in
getting to this new world,

00:30:19.926 --> 00:30:21.300
and not having
enough energy left

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.000
to blast the crap out of it.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.140
So we need to find
the shortest path.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.680
So first Mark programs a
simple branch and bound search.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.040
He adds in an extended
list to his branch

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.630
and bound just to make
it a little bit faster.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.600
As usual, he breaks
ties of equal length

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.470
in lexicographic order.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.450
So let's list the nodes
that Mark's computer adds

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.467
to the extended list in order.

00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:47.050
Distances are shown
next to the edges.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.530
Ignore the number in
parentheses for now.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.180
They are heuristics, and
we're not using them.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.740
So that brings me
to another point

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.720
that I'd like to
drive home before we

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.320
go for the home stretch
and solve these problems.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.740
What the heck is the difference
between branch and bound

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.290
and A*?

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.130
OK.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.740
I like to liken it
to the following.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.880
I probably should have, I'll
make this a silver star idea.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.130
OK.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.194
The silver star idea is pizza.

00:31:18.194 --> 00:31:19.610
It doesn't really
look like pizza,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.943
but that's the silver star idea.

00:31:20.943 --> 00:31:23.230
Branch and bound
is a cheese pizza.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.210
It's simple.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.600
If you order it
for a large group

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.433
event of college students,
they will eat it,

00:31:27.433 --> 00:31:30.650
and things will be OK.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.330
Now A* search is some kind of
meat lover's or supreme pizza.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.530
Maybe a meat lover's pizza.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:36.960
It's got all these
extra toppings.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.793
A lot of people are
really going to like it.

00:31:38.793 --> 00:31:39.650
It might be better.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.025
But then you've
got a vegetarian,

00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:43.840
and everything's screwed up.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:49.130
So basically, A* is just branch
and bound with some extra

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.990
toppings added on.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.970
In this case, one of the
toppings is an extended list,

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.320
an extended list
which we'll see keeps

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.920
track of where we've passed
through and already expanded

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.140
out, and it never goes back.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.980
The other topping that we're
going to add is a heuristic.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.090
A heuristic tells
us about how far

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.210
we think we have left
until we're at the end,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.830
so we don't go through really
short paths that go completely

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.330
in the wrong direction.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.480
All right?

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.700
Between the two of those,
we get our supreme pizza,

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.410
but sometimes, as
we'll see, they sort of

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.280
mess each other up.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.270
So one of the toppings
just doesn't go well

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.061
with the other one.

00:32:27.061 --> 00:32:28.660
Maybe someone doesn't Hawaiian.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.865
They think that the ham doesn't
go well with the pineapple.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.290
So let's do a branch and bound
that just has an extended list.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.489
Maybe we've got some green
peppers on this pizza.

00:32:42.489 --> 00:32:43.530
This is going to be safe.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.020
All right.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.480
So we're going to list the
nodes as to the extended list,

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.580
and the way we're going
to do that is, well,

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.690
you guys said you like
goal tree more than queue,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.770
so let's do it with a goal tree.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:03.620
So we've got S, and
as we already know,

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.170
S is the only path.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.460
Our current length at S is 0.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.020
That's the lowest of all of
our lengths on the tree cause

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.650
it's the only length.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:21.110
So we go to A, B, and C.
It may be hard to see,

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.260
so the length of SA is 100.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.250
The length of SB is--

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.935
AUDIENCE: You mean ABEF?

00:33:29.935 --> 00:33:32.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.253
[CHATTER]

00:33:33.253 --> 00:33:33.836
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:33:33.836 --> 00:33:34.190
You're right.

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:35.106
It's a different tree.

00:33:35.106 --> 00:33:37.060
I was doing A, B, and
C from the other tree.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.870
Thank you, friends, for
correcting my foolishness.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.330
The length of SB is 3.

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.690
It is a different tree.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.480
I was trying to save
work that wound up

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.920
creating more because someone's
going to be confused by this.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.680
So the length of A, B, E,
and F are 100, 3, 14, and 14.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.820
Which one do we choose?

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.360
Lexicographically, it's A.
We choose that one, right?

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.760
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.530
PROFESSOR: F is going to be 14.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.030
That' a 1.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:05.529
Sorry.

00:34:05.529 --> 00:34:07.150
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:07.980
4.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:08.896
PROFESSOR: Oh, it's 4?

00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:11.860
I wrote this problem.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.420
I should know it.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:12.961
You're right.

00:34:12.961 --> 00:34:14.120
F is 4.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.775
My apologies once more.

00:34:15.775 --> 00:34:16.561
That's what I get.

00:34:16.561 --> 00:34:17.060
All right.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.601
I'm going to stand
over here from now

00:34:18.601 --> 00:34:22.050
on when I write over there.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.840
OK.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.060
So which one of these
are we going to choose?

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:28.730
Even with the 4, we're going
to choose B. That's right.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:29.889
Lexicographic be damned.

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:31.120
It's only for tiebreaks.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.916
We want the shortest path.

00:34:32.916 --> 00:34:34.540
Our special thing
with branch and bound

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.420
is we take the currently
shortest path, whatever it is.

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.659
Great.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.739
So we expand B.
Fortunately, and I'm

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:43.630
pretty sure I've got this
correct this time-- oh wait,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.560
I've got an even better idea.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.480
I'll just take this
little hand sheet with me,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.530
and then I don't have
to look at that at all.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:50.030
OK.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:55.550
So once we expand B, B goes to
D. Our path length from B to D

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.000
is 4, so what will we write
next to little G here?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.630
7.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.920
That's right.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.961
We add them all together.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.696
I'm going to ask you guys
again the next time we

00:35:05.696 --> 00:35:07.112
do this with the
heuristics, which

00:35:07.112 --> 00:35:08.360
is going to be the next
part of the problem,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.780
and someone's going to give
me the wrong answer next time.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.281
So stay tuned for that.

00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:12.780
All right.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:13.702
So we've got SBD.

00:35:13.702 --> 00:35:14.660
We've got all of these.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.000
Where do we go next?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.520
F. That's right,
because currently 4

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.570
is the shortest because you
guys corrected me correctly.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:22.650
So SF.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:23.940
4 is the shortest.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:28.104
F only goes to H. And what
do we write next to the H?

00:35:28.104 --> 00:35:29.030
20.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.980
That's right.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.440
16 plus 4, 20.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:32.940
All right.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.130
Where's our current shortest?

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.870
It's the D, SBD.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:37.400
All right?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.265
So SBD.

00:35:38.265 --> 00:35:41.790
D only goes to I,
and we've got a 57.

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:50.430
Wait a minute.

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.020
I want to get this problem
right, so we better

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.650
actually write
the extended list,

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.460
[INAUDIBLE] because that's the
only thing they're asking us

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.120
for.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:01.650
So first we extended S.
Then we extended B. Then we

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:08.050
extended F. Then we
extended D. All right.

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:09.190
So far, so good.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.840
And I have the answer key, so
I know we're doing it right.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.520
OK.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.340
What are we doing next?

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.890
E. That's right.

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:22.070
So we extend E. E goes to
H. And when E goes to H,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.010
we've got a length of 30.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.650
All right.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.590
Who's our winner now?

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.210
Which H?

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.949
SFH.

00:36:29.949 --> 00:36:30.490
That's right.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.392
SFH is length 20.

00:36:32.392 --> 00:36:34.350
Oh yeah, of course I
should write an E in here.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:35.920
I always forget to do that.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.070
SFH is length 20,
so we will extend H,

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.680
and I'm going to write
it here preemptively.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:47.050
When we extend H over here, H
only goes to I, with length 50.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:47.780
Great.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.170
What's the next shortest?

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.242
The next shortest is the other
H. However, will we expand it?

00:36:55.242 --> 00:36:57.700
You guessed that because I
asked that question in that way.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.900
You knew the answer was no.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.510
Why don't we expand it?

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:03.140
It's already on
the extended list.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.920
That's right.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.850
So since it's already
on the extended list,

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.360
this one dies a horrible death.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.920
I like writing an X through it
instead of writing a swizzle

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.370
at the bottom.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.090
You can do whatever you want.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:16.350
All right, it's gone.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.120
It's not a choice.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:20.260
What's the next best one?

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.510
SFHI.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.370
That's right.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.770
That goes to G, and
the length is 60.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:31.100
And we've extended I. All right.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.535
Question is, are we done?

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:38.210
The people who say
no, I like you.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.852
You're smart.

00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:40.310
You realize that
just because the G

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.850
is on there, that we can't end.

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.320
However, the people who
said yes, you are either

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.864
oblivious or really,
really smart,

00:37:47.864 --> 00:37:49.530
and I'm going to
choose to assume you're

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.520
all really, really smart because
the really, really smart people

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.300
said, OK.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.050
Yes, we're not quite
done just because we

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.320
added a G. We
still have to check

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.840
to make sure there are no
lengths with shorter path,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.660
but look.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.420
The only one with
a shorter path is

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.340
I, which is already
on the extended list.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.930
So actually, we are done.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:07.120
Double check.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:07.940
We've got it.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.970
So these are the paths
we extended in order,

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.640
and our final path is?

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.625
Everyone.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:15.050
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.620
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.770
SFHIG.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.180
I claim that is
the correct path.

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.740
However, Mark is frustrated
by branch and bound's speed.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.550
I don't know.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.670
I wasn't that frustrated.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.610
Seemed pretty good.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.330
But Mark is frustrated by
branch and bound's speed,

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.980
so he reprograms his
computer to use A*.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.510
Mark counts the number of
subspace anomalies between each

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:38.110
universe and the goal, and uses
this count as the heuristic

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.686
for A*.

00:38:38.686 --> 00:38:40.060
These numbers are
in parentheses.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.410
Hopefully, you can read them.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.910
Yes?

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.820
Oh, we've got a question.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.600
Right here?

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.584
AUDIENCE: So, given
the implementation,

00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:49.568
you said that you expand
all possible nodes.

00:38:49.568 --> 00:38:52.544
So why doesn't I go to C and
D, as well as [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:52.544 --> 00:38:55.040
Like, why doesn't it
expand to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:55.750
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.330
That is a very good question.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:01.000
And the answer is, a
very simple answer.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.070
You guys tricked me.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.111
No, but I should have been
able to figure it out.

00:39:04.111 --> 00:39:08.145
It does go to C and D. The
correct tree, which we wouldn't

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:10.270
have lost points for having
the incorrect tree here

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.000
cause we did get the
correct answer, yes.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.622
The reason why it is, that same
reason that very first time I

00:39:15.622 --> 00:39:17.705
asked someone something,
he didn't remember the C.

00:39:17.705 --> 00:39:20.860
It's easy to forget
to go up the tree.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.890
It does actually have
a C and D. However,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.830
they are horrendous paths.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:29.939
They are 100 and 100
on their path length,

00:39:29.939 --> 00:39:30.980
and so it doesn't matter.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.280
But you were correct.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.239
The official answer we
had up there is wrong.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:37.981
AUDIENCE: Would the D get added
to this list of children that's

00:39:37.981 --> 00:39:39.460
already in the extended list?

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.750
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.040
The question is, would the
D get added to the children?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.000
After all, it's already
in the extended list.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.400
The answer is, we search
for, and remove, and kill

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.130
all of the attempts to
extend something that's

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.400
already on the expanded list at
the time we try to expand it.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.052
The time we try to
expand it is only

00:39:58.052 --> 00:39:59.510
when it's on the
front of the queue

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:01.890
because it's the
currently shortest path.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.692
So that means they get added.

00:40:03.692 --> 00:40:05.650
It's just that when it
comes time to expand it,

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.745
it will get crossed
off no matter what.

00:40:07.745 --> 00:40:10.292
Turns out, it escaped
execution because of the fact

00:40:10.292 --> 00:40:11.440
that we never expanded it.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.920
AUDIENCE: So H should
go to E as well?

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.350
PROFESSOR: So H should go to
E as well, is the question.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:17.520
The answer is yes.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.140
H should go to E as well.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.710
A lot slipped past me this time.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.750
H should go to E as well,
with a length of 36,

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:26.910
and it dies there.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.817
This one will
actually be checked,

00:40:31.817 --> 00:40:33.400
so it actually does
make a difference.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.070
If we ask how many times was
a node executed due to already

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.060
being on the extended list?

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:41.910
Very good.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.930
Very good notice.

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:44.210
It should be on there.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.821
We'll get it right next time.

00:40:46.821 --> 00:40:48.150
All right, everyone.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.670
So I'm working
together with you.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.000
I made the mistake too.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.950
Easy one to make.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:53.950
It can mess you up.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.130
It didn't this time.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.252
We're going to
get it-- question?

00:40:57.252 --> 00:41:00.138
AUDIENCE: If G's
the goal at the end,

00:41:00.138 --> 00:41:05.551
and you get G in your outcomes,
and you know the number that's

00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:07.050
shorter than
everything else, do you

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.600
have to actually extend at G?

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.610
PROFESSOR: So, the question
is, do you actually extend G?

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:14.720
Should we even put G
in the extended list?

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.750
The answer is, the
answer to that question

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.170
is, it is a matter of taste.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.682
And in the questions
where we, in my opinion,

00:41:22.682 --> 00:41:24.890
rather foolishly, asked how
many nodes were extended,

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.870
rather than ask you
to write them out,

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.230
we generally accept the
answer where you didn't extend

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.310
or where you did extend G.
It's an implementation detail.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.860
You can either have a
fail safe that, as soon

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.437
as it sees G at the beginning
of the list, says, we're out.

00:41:37.437 --> 00:41:38.520
We're not going to extend.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:38.870
We're done.

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:39.500
We win.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.250
Or a fail safe that, when you're
about to extend something,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.190
and you go into the
extension process,

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.650
and it sees that it
ends in G, that it wins.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.340
So it is a matter of taste.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.720
If you kind of like to
watch your little guy

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.040
doing the search win,
and have an S and a G,

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:54.835
you can put it on.

00:41:54.835 --> 00:41:57.670
If you don't, you
can not put it on.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.490
We won't take off points
for whether or not

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.180
it has a G at the end
because clearly, if you

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.710
did all the other crazy
stuff correct, well,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.240
you could have written
in a G if you wanted to.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.780
I think, unless there's someone
who mis-solves the problem

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.020
right at the end, is like,
oh, who cares about G?

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.834
Oh no, it's stuck.

00:42:14.834 --> 00:42:15.500
It's a dead end.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.570
We lose.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.650
But that would be
probably pretty rare.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:23.350
So let's solve the A*.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.600
So I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.840
We go from S to ABEF.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.910
And S, by the way,
had a value of 0.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:34.410
All right.

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:36.550
What is the value at A?

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.611
Well, I think it's 160.

00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:42.360
The question is, how
do we calculate this?

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.350
Well, it's the path
that we've traveled

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:49.070
so far plus the heuristic
value at the final node.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.370
This is why someone's going to
give me the wrong answer at BD,

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:53.580
but let's see.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:56.040
So we have 160 here.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:56.940
OK.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.766
So SB.

00:42:59.766 --> 00:43:01.140
What is the
heuristic value here?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:07.790
We've got 3 for the path, and 50
for the heuristic, so it's 53.

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.514
SE.

00:43:08.514 --> 00:43:09.430
What have we got here?

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:15.420
We've got 14 for the path, 56
for the heuristic, so it's 70.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.467
All right.

00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:17.720
SF.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.290
We've got 4 for the path,
50 for the heuristic, 54.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:22.980
OK.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.680
Who's our winner?

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.800
It's B again.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.370
Barely, but it is the winner.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.450
Extended list up here.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.110
SB.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:30.680
All right.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:34.759
B, as we saw, goes only to D.

00:43:34.759 --> 00:43:36.550
What is the value that
I should write here?

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.240
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:39.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.060
I am happy I heard all the
things that I expected to hear.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.580
I heard the correct
answer, which is 57.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:48.160
I also heard someone say 107.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.160
So why is it 57, and not 107?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:53.930
Someone does it
this way every time.

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.889
Do not add up all the
heuristics along the way.

00:43:55.889 --> 00:43:57.888
I will try to explain to
you why you would never

00:43:57.888 --> 00:43:58.910
want to do that.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.000
The heuristic value
at any given node

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.430
says, given that I'm here,
how much work do I think

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.620
I have left to get to the end?

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:09.430
All right?

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.192
It's sort of like, let's guess
the last few nodes in the path

00:44:12.192 --> 00:44:13.400
that we haven't done out yet.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.590
So you can see why it
would be bad to add that

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.200
for every node in your list
because then you're double

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.330
counting all of the last nodes.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.730
So add the path so far to
the very final heuristic.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:29.050
That's 3 plus 4 plus the
50 that's with D is 57.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:35.100
So our current winner, then,
is 54, with F. Just the same

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:35.680
as last time.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.235
F goes to H. And what's
our total value at H?

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.880
20 plus, that's a 39, 59.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.510
So who wins now?

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.960
D, with 57.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.290
But we extended F, yes.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.790
All right.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:55.900
So D was 57.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.400
All right.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.420
So D was not one of the ones
that I tricked myself with.

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:03.740
D only goes to I.
What's our value at I?

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:11.310
I think our value is 57
because I has a heuristic of 0.

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:11.810
Yes.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:12.990
I has a heuristic of 0.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.550
Our value at I is 57.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:17.430
OK?

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:20.870
And I extended D.
Who's the winner now?

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:21.450
I?

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:21.950
OK.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.510
So I is the winner.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:29.210
With I as the winner, we extend
I. I goes to C, D. Ha ha.

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:33.290
Good call, whoever back there
figured out my secret error

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.980
before.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.510
C, D, and G.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.140
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.870
PROFESSOR: C, H, and G?

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.680
Oh, you're right.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.690
We already went to D. Aha.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.480
C, H, and G. You're correct.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.230
Everyone see that?

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.280
C, H, and G. Absolutely right.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:53.400
I goes to C, H, and G. So
the path to C, H, and G

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.700
is a hard path.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.500
To C, we got, what did we have?

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.480
57 plus 50 is 127.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.472
Oh, and by the way,
C, G, and H. We've

00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:06.490
got to do it in
lexicographic order.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:10.580
So 127 to C. To G, we have 67.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.320
And to H, we have 87.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.310
So who wins now?

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:26.130
H. H, with 59.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.750
That's right.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:30.460
H, with 59.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.960
And as we already
know, cause it was

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.610
the winner last
time, H, with 59,

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:41.635
goes to I, which
has, I believe, 50.

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.620
Well, it's still gets added.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.170
Remember?

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.253
We're only going to kill
it when it gets extended.

00:46:49.253 --> 00:46:50.745
So who's the shortest?

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.120
So you were a step ahead,
whoever asked me that question.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.840
Who's the shortest?

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.990
H also goes to E.
Absolutely right.

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.350
H also goes to E. I was
getting ahead of myself here.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.900
H also goes to E with
a length of extra 16.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:11.600
So we've got 20 plus
16 is 36 plus 56 is 92.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.100
All right.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.060
That's good.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.060
So who's the shortest?

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:17.810
I is the shortest.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:19.200
Do we extend it?

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:19.700
No.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:22.910
It's on the extended list.

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:23.460
All right.

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.710
Who's the shortest now?

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:29.036
It's hard to read, but the
shortest is this 67 on the G.

00:47:29.036 --> 00:47:29.800
So we're done.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.940
We win.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.840
Our path is SBDIG.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:34.550
Yeah, for A*.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.600
It gets the right answer, right?

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.390
No.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.990
Unfortunately not.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.670
So what happened here?

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.310
Why did we not get
the right answer?

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:44.470
Be as specific as possible.

00:47:48.184 --> 00:47:49.850
What are people saying
about heuristics?

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.876
AUDIENCE: [CHATTER]

00:47:51.876 --> 00:47:52.750
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.320
People are saying the
heuristic must be consistent.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.250
That is both correct and
specific, so I applaud you.

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.210
Too easy to say the
heuristic was inadmissible.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.140
It actually was completely
admissible everywhere.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.771
So that leads us into our
very last point for the day.

00:48:06.771 --> 00:48:08.645
What the hell are these
heuristic consistency

00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:11.557
and admissibility things,
and why do I care?

00:48:11.557 --> 00:48:13.890
Well, the reason why you care
is many fold, one of which

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:16.700
is that it's almost
guaranteed to be on the quiz.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.920
But what are they?

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.180
Admissibility is a check
at every point to make sure

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.644
your heuristic at
that point, which

00:48:22.644 --> 00:48:24.560
is supposed to be an
estimate of how much work

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.221
you have left to do, is always
an underestimate or an accurate

00:48:28.221 --> 00:48:28.720
estimate.

00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.550
It can never be an overestimate.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:31.160
Why not?

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.410
Well, as Patrick showed you
with his mostly correct example

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.341
in lecture, if it's
an overestimate,

00:48:36.341 --> 00:48:37.840
it's never going
to expand that node

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.870
cause it's going to think, you
know, if you write one million

00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:41.110
as a heuristic,
it's going to think

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:43.210
it needs to do one million
after it's done going that way.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.970
It's not going to
want to go that way.

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.670
All right?

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.620
So it's always got to
be an underestimate

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.220
or an equal estimate.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:52.410
But let's say that
you, at the quiz,

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.100
and you forget
Mark told me this.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.360
You didn't bring any notes.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.326
You're just having
a brain freeze.

00:48:56.326 --> 00:48:57.320
You're like, oh no.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.420
Is it supposed to
be an overestimate

00:48:58.420 --> 00:48:59.253
or an underestimate?

00:48:59.253 --> 00:49:00.378
I can't remember which one.

00:49:00.378 --> 00:49:01.378
How can I figure it out?

00:49:01.378 --> 00:49:02.420
How can I figure it out?

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.590
I propose you the following
calm, soothing mantra slash

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:08.760
sutra that will
help protect you.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.659
Think to yourself of
the following question.

00:49:11.659 --> 00:49:13.950
We know that A* sometimes
messes up with the heuristic.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:17.170
Does branch and bound
always get it right?

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:17.910
Yes.

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:19.740
What heuristic values
does branch and bound

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.480
add everywhere?

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.190
0.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.690
Right?

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:23.523
It has no heuristic.

00:49:23.523 --> 00:49:25.400
It essentially adds 0.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.280
Is 0 an overestimate
or an underestimate?

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.160
An underestimate.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.867
Therefore, since branch
and bound always works,

00:49:31.867 --> 00:49:33.825
the one you're looking
for is an underestimate.

00:49:33.825 --> 00:49:35.710
And I know from when I
was taking the class,

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:37.867
I always had a moment
where I had to spend, like,

00:49:37.867 --> 00:49:39.450
two minutes convincing
myself, OK, I'm

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:41.230
going for underestimate,
not overestimate.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.970
This will help.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.030
It will take fewer than
two minutes to do that.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.720
So what is consistency?

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.950
Consistency is a little
bit stronger of a claim.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.130
When you claim that a
graph is consistent,

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.640
what you're saying is,
between any two nodes,

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.750
or to do it more simply,
between any two adjacent nodes,

00:49:57.750 --> 00:50:00.230
the distance between
the heuristics

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.890
is less than the distance
between the nodes.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:07.400
In other words,
admissibility is a sort

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.500
of, like, consistency
between every node in G.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.780
Whereas consistency is
consistency between every node

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.390
and every other node.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:15.430
All right?

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:17.680
Consistency is a stronger claim.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.740
Any graph that's consistent
is always admissible.

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.527
Any graph that is inadmissible
is always inconsistent.

00:50:25.527 --> 00:50:26.610
That's the contrapositive.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:26.980
Question?

00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.854
AUDIENCE: Less than or
less than or equal to?

00:50:28.854 --> 00:50:31.080
PROFESSOR: Equal to is still OK.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.350
Equal to is always OK.

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:32.960
That's great.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.959
It's a perfect estimate.

00:50:33.959 --> 00:50:35.420
But never greater.

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:38.927
Now, if a graph is
inconsistent, will you lose?

00:50:38.927 --> 00:50:39.510
Will you lose?

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:42.830
Why is it called admissible,
then, if it's sometimes not

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.245
admissible?

00:50:45.245 --> 00:50:45.870
Why do we lose?

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:48.390
The answer is the extended
list, and you see that here.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.090
If a graph is admissible,
you will always

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:55.410
get the right answer
unless you use an extended

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.250
list because you're
checking from every node

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.200
to the goal node.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.120
And you're sure that
your estimates are right.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.075
But if estimates within
nodes aren't correct,

00:51:02.075 --> 00:51:03.700
you might go through
them out of order,

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:05.270
and that violates
your assumption

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.030
that you made when
you decided to use

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.655
the extended list
that you would always

00:51:08.655 --> 00:51:10.980
go through the
sub-graphs in order.

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:13.955
This graph is very expertly
crafted to do that to

00:51:13.955 --> 00:51:15.420
you cause I might
as well be sort

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.327
of a bottleneck, goal node,
and I has an inconsistency.

00:51:18.327 --> 00:51:20.410
There's a few other
inconsistencies in this graph,

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.860
but they don't do
anything to you.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.200
In fact, even inadmissibilities
sometimes don't mess you up.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.424
So you can't just say,
blindly, it's inadmissible,

00:51:27.424 --> 00:51:28.340
so it will never work.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.142
It might work.

00:51:29.142 --> 00:51:30.600
It turns out the
only inconsistency

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.630
that matters here is not the
inconsistency between, say,

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.590
S and F. That doesn't
turn out to matter.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:38.560
It's the inconsistency
between some of these nodes,

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.570
including I and H, specifically.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:45.340
So have a good weekend.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:47.090
Come in on Monday and
Tuesday to tutorial.

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:49.739
Ask about the queue
method, or other methods.

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.780
Ask about anything that's
niggling in your brain.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.780
But hopefully, you
guys have got this.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.780
You're going to do fine.
