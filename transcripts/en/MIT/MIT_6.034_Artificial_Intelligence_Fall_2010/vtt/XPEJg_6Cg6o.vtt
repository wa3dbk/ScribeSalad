PATRICK WINSTON: Well,
don't stop.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.710
Shoot.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.280
I guess we've got to stop.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.310
I will soon go into withdrawal
symptoms that will

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.890
last about six weeks.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.570
But, on the other hand, we all
are beginning to develop a

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.270
sort of tired and
desperate look.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.500
And perhaps it's a good thing to
get the semester behind us

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.312
and go into solstice
hibernation.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.250
Anyway, there's a
lot to do today.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.490
I want to wrap up a couple
things, talk about what's

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.720
next, and maybe get into some
big issues, perhaps a little

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.990
Genesis demo, that
sort of thing.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.150
So here's what we're
going to do first.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.730
Last time, I talked about
this whole idea

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.440
of structure discovery.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.180
And really, the whole reason I
cracked and started talking

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
about basic methods is because
of the potential utility of

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.790
taking that idea one step
further and finding structure

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.170
in situations where you might
not otherwise find it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.060
It's still an open question
about whether that's best way

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.740
to think about it.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.990
But here it goes.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.040
Imagine you've got a
couple of stories.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.630
And these circles represent
the events in the story.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.320
And now what you'd like to get
out of these stories is some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.080
kind of finite state graph that
describes the collection

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.760
of stories.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.350
So you might discover, for
example, that these two events

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.200
are quite similar.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.940
And these two events
are quite similar.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.420
So you might use that as a basis
for speculating that

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.080
maybe a more compact way of
representing the stuff in the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.020
story would look like this.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.690
Where this one--

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.030
let's see.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.800
This one goes with this one,
this one goes with this one

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.090
and there's a possibility of
another state in between.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.090
So that's the notion of Bayesian
story merging.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.810
Now I'd like to show you a
little bit more convincing

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.830
demonstration of that.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.080
Here's how it goes.

00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:18.290
So there are the two stories.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.406
This is just a classroom
demonstration, no big deal.

00:02:21.406 --> 00:02:23.530
But you can see there's
a sort of parallel

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.520
structure in there.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.995
So this is the work of a
graduate student, Mark

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:33.050
Finlayson, who processed those
stories to produce those kinds

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.790
of events and those kinds of
events that get assembled into

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.600
two story graphs.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.370
And the question is, is the
most probable way of

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.640
explaining that corpus
of stories?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.140
And of course, the
answer is no.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.680
If you merge some things like
chase and stop, then you get a

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.980
simpler graph, one that is
more probable in the same

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.290
sense that we discussed
last time.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860
Then you can merge run and flee
because they're similar

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.880
kinds of events.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.460
And finally, you've got
think and decide.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.980
Boom.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.310
There is your story graph.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.590
And this is the same idea taken
several levels higher

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.180
that produce the capacity to
discover, in these two

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.180
stories, the concept of revenge,
as promised at the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.860
beginning of our last
discussion.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.630
So sometimes the Bayesian stuff
is the right thing to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.960
do, especially if you
don't know anything.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.370
But sometimes you
do know stuff.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.320
And when you do know stuff it's
possible that you can do

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.560
something very much
more efficient.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.200
This sort of thing
takes clouds of

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.130
computers to process.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.670
But we learned a lot of stuff
in the course of our

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.670
development that we don't
use a cloud of

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.650
computers to figure out.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.250
We learned how to associate the
gestures of our mouth with

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.160
the sounds that we make,
for example.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.200
So I want to spend a minute or
two talking about some work

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.790
that someday will be the
subject of a couple of

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.586
lectures, I think.

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:18.250
But it's the question of how to
use multiple modalities and

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.720
correspondences between them
to sort out both of the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.820
contributing modalities.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:26.910
That sounds contradictory.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.160
Let me show you an example.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.780
This is the example,
a zebra finch.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.090
And it's showing you the result
of a program written by

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.700
Michael Coen, now a
professor at the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.410
University of Wisconsin.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.420
So the male zebra finch learns
to sing a nice mating song

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.160
from its daddy.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.240
And this is what one such
zebra finch sounds like.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.690
[BIRD SONG PLAYING]

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.100
Nice, don't you think?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.620
And here's what was learned
by a program that uses no

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.150
probabilistic stuff at all,
but rather the notion of

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.528
cross-modal coupling.

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:09.472
[BIRD SONG PLAYING]

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:12.700
Can you tell the difference?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.970
It's not known if this
particular song turns on the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.775
female zebra finch.

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:21.750
But to the untrained human
ear, they sure

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.550
sound a whole lot alike.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.170
So how does that work?

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.420
Here's how that works.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.280
Well, I'm not going to show
you how that works.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.350
What I'm going to show you is
how the classroom example

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.780
works, the first chapter
example in

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.930
Coen's Ph.D. Thesis.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.070
Here's what happens.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.740
When we talk, we produce a
Fourier transform that moves

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.250
along with our speech.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.250
And if we say a vowel like aah,
you get a fairly constant

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.930
Fourier spectrum.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.800
And you can say, well, where
are the peaks in

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.080
that Fourier spectrum?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.260
And how do they correspond to
the appearance of my mouth

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.020
when I say the vowel?

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.970
So here's how that works.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:14.130
So here's the Fourier spectrum
of a particular vowel.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.530
And when you smooth that, those

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.530
peaks are called formants.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.710
And so we're just going to keep
track of the first and

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.270
second formant.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.660
But when I say those things,
I also can form an ellipse

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.540
around my mouth when
I say them.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.560
And when I form an ellipse
around my mouth when I say

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.100
them, that gives me this
second modality.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.010
So the question is, is there
a way of associating the

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.690
gestures that produce the sound
with the sound itself?

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.600
Well, there's the human data
conveniently provided by a

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.480
variety of sources, including
Michael Coen's wife who

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.300
produced the lip contour
data on the right.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.150
So that's all marked up and
color coded according to the

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.320
particular vowels in English.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.040
I guess there are ten of them.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.120
So we humans all learn that.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.610
But guess what?

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.460
We don't learn it from this.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.170
Because we don't get to work
with any marked up data.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.360
We learn it from that.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.710
Somehow we're exposed to the
natural world, and we dig the

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.190
vowel sounds out.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.890
It's fantastic how we do that.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.405
But we do have cross modal
coupling data and maybe that's

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:25.280
got something to do with it.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.345
So here is a particular
cluster of sounds.

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:30.680
And what I want to know is, can
I merge any of these two

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.260
clusters to form a bigger
cluster with a

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.160
corresponding meaning?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.720
So what I can do is, I can say,
well, I can watch these.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.740
I know what the lip
form is when a

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.780
particular sound is made.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.770
So I have these correspondences.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.780
So maybe there are four
of those, like so.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.980
And maybe this same guy
projects a couple

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.210
of tones into that.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.276
And the question is, can this
guy be combined with any of

00:08:03.276 --> 00:08:04.190
these guys?

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:05.510
And the answer is yes.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.880
If they're close together on one
side, maybe that suggests

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.090
you ought to cluster them
on the other side.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.830
But there's a question about
what close means.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.760
So let's suppose that we also
look at how these guys, these

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.555
other two guys, project.

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:24.310
And suppose this guy projects
twice up here

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.280
and once over here.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.230
And this guy down here
just projects like

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.380
crazy into that guy.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.320
Which are closer?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.510
These two or these two?

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.190
Well, my diagram's getting
a little closer.

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.380
But if you paid attention when
I was drawing it, you would

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.570
see that this guy projects in
proportion to that guy.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.030
So if we look at the-- if we
take each of these projections

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.440
as the components of a vector,
then those two vectors are in

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.380
the same direction.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.020
And the cosine between
them is zero.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:08.950
So these are the two that are
closest together from that

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.460
sort of perspective of
that kind of metric.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.106
And those guys are the ones
who get combined.

00:09:15.106 --> 00:09:16.793
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

00:09:16.793 --> 00:09:17.780
Yeah.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.630
OK, here's a demonstration
based on Coen's work.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.350
So here we have two sides.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.572
We could think of one side as
being vowel sounds and the

00:09:35.572 --> 00:09:38.930
other side as being lip
contours or something.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.770
But you don't see anything in
the diagram so far about how

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.490
these things ought to be
sorted out into groups.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.080
So if I just take one step, why,
it discovers that those

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.760
two guys had the
same projection

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.700
pattern as each other.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.860
So if I take another step and do
the same thing on the other

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:05.130
side, and now in the third step,
the two areas that were

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.920
formerly combined now
form a super area.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.260
And they're seen to project in
the same way as the blue area.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.640
So using this kind of projection
idea, I can

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.480
gradually build up an
understanding of how those

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.730
regions go together.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.710
And I discover, in this
contrived example, that

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.290
there's a vertical arrangement
on the right side that

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.692
corresponds to a horizontal
arrangement on the left side.

00:10:32.692 --> 00:10:34.670
Now, you say to me, I'd like to
see something a little bit

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:37.940
more like the lip
contour data.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.890
I'm just stepping through
here until I get

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.400
something I kind of like.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.020
Oh, that sounds good.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.540
That seems good.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.420
So there's a correspondence
here.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.730
This is all made up data,
Gaussians of various shapes

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.920
and orientations.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.210
Let's see what happens when
I run the clustering

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:59.460
algorithm on that.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.860
Something definite was learned
at every step.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.290
We find the correspondence
between the pink region on the

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.320
right and the pink region
on the left.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.370
In some cases, where the regions
are rather blurred

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.730
together, the other side is the
one that helps the system

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.060
figure out how things
are organized.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.390
So I cite this as an example
of something I

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.470
think is very important.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.230
Number one, it's possible to
discover regularity without

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.440
being obsessively concerned
with Bayesian probability.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:36.940
And also, that there's very
likely a whole lot of this

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.480
going on in human
intelligence.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.630
When we emerge and begin to
examine and explore the world

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.520
around us, we're presented with
a lot of unlabeled data

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.460
that we've got to
make sense of.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.540
And I believe that this kind of
cross modal coupling idea

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:01.340
is very likely to be bound up
in our understanding of that

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.000
world that's presented to us.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.340
It's fast, it's direct.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.465
It doesn't take thousands
of data points.

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:08.700
It just happens.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.450
And it happens effortlessly.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.434
And if this isn't built in--

00:12:13.434 --> 00:12:17.700
if this isn't determined to be
built in, you can come back to

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.470
MIT in 15 years and
put me and jail.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.900
Because I think this is really
the way it works.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.950
So there it is.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.800
There's a couple of things
to have wrapped up.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.650
And now the next thing I want to
do for the rest of our last

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.780
time together in this format
is talk to you about

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.200
a variety of things.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.690
And I'll depart from my
usual practice and

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.380
move to some slides.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.020
So Dave, could we have the
center screen, please?

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.900
So first, a brief review of
where we've been and where

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.090
we've come.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.600
I think in the very first class,
I talked about what

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.570
artificial intelligence was.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.640
And I talked about how you could
view it from either an

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.620
engineering perspective or
a scientific perspective.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.930
I'm on the scientific
perspective side.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.730
And I think, nothing against
applications, but I think

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.820
we'll be able to make much
more sophisticated and

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.970
wonderful applications if we
have not only the engineering

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.450
perspective about building stuff
but also the scientific

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.250
perspective about understanding
the stuff to

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.230
begin with.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.790
So both perspectives
are important.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.590
And in this case you can see
that they all involve

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.770
representations, methods,
and architectures.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.850
Dave, I've changed my mind.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:46.440
Could you also give me
the side screen so

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.690
I can see it too?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.120
So, that's that.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.750
What's next?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.520
The business perspective,
which we talked about on

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.120
Thanksgiving.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.950
The important idea being that
the knee-jerk expectation that

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.300
the commercial value of
something is in replacing

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:10.850
people is something that is
not sensible in the first

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.250
instance, and demonstrated to be
unlikely and untrue in the

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.550
second instance.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.380
The thing that turns people on
from the point of view of

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.790
applications is not replacing
people but making new revenue,

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.760
making new capability.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.570
And that at once licenses you
to not have something done

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.620
exclusively by a computer but
something that can be done in

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.506
partnership with a person.

00:14:30.506 --> 00:14:33.950
So all the important
applications of artificial

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:38.210
intelligence involve people
and computers working in

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.740
tandem, with each doing
what they do best--

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.170
not with replacing people.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.410
So that's that.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.550
Here's what AI does that makes
AI different from the rest of

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.370
the fields that attempt to
contribute to an understanding

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.570
of intelligence.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.010
Now, we have the benefit of
having a language for

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.430
procedures.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:07.790
We have all the metaphors that
we are the custodians of in

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.926
consequences of knowing
about programming.

00:15:10.926 --> 00:15:14.410
We have the metaphor of
garbage collection.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.770
We can talk about all sorts
of things with programming

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:22.430
metaphors that are unavailable
to people in other fields that

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.360
are interested in psychology.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.450
We have a way to make models
because we can write programs.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.280
And when we write programs,
there's no question of

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.510
sweeping things under the rug.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.690
We have to work out
the details.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.720
And once we've done all that,
then we have opportunities to

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.190
experiment that are beyond the
ability to experiment in most

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.580
other fields.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.580
Oh, magnificent experiments
are done these days in

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.010
developmental psychology
and all the rest of--

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.020
all the other branches of
psychology, including MRI

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.130
studies that probe into your
brain and see how it's

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.010
consuming sugar.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.920
But it's very difficult to
ablate or take away some piece

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.840
of your knowledge and see
how you work without it.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.600
I can take the line-drawing
program that we talked about

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.820
and say, how will it do if it
doesn't know anything about

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.600
fork junctions?

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.180
And we can determine
an answer.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.620
But I can't reach into
Sebastian's head here with a

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.350
surgical procedure
and take out his

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.525
knowledge of fork junctions.

00:16:20.525 --> 00:16:23.270
It just can't be done.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.730
And finally, another reason why
we're different is because

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.460
we can put upper bounds on how
much knowledge is needed in

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.530
order to perform a certain
kind of task.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.660
These days, with bulldozer
computing, the question most

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.130
often asked is, how can you get
billions of the things off

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.810
the web and use them.

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.280
We--

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.330
I especially-- sometimes ask the
opposite question, which

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.310
is how little knowledge
can you have and still

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.550
understand a story?

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.890
That's what's interesting
to me.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.810
So there's a methodological
slide that talks to the

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.910
question of how you do
artificial intelligence in

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.890
particular and, I suppose,
science in general,

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.770
engineering in general.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.329
There's a great tendency in
this field to fall in love

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.520
with particular methods.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.964
And we've had people who've
devoted entire careers to

00:17:14.964 --> 00:17:18.520
neural nets, genetic algorithms,
Bayesian

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.829
probability.

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:23.480
And that's mechanism envy.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.579
And a better way, in my
judgment, is to say, what is

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:27.170
the problem?

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.970
Scientific method-- what's
the problem?

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.070
And then bring the right
machinery to bear on the

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.610
problem, rather than looking
for things to do with a

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.580
particular kind of machinery.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:44.080
So this is the methodology that
first articulated in a

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.600
forceful way, by David Marr.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.120
You want to start with the
competence you're trying to

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.770
understand, then bring a
representation to bear on it,

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.770
a representation that exposes
the constraints and

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.470
regularities.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.230
Because without those, you
can't make models.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:01.540
And without those models you
can't understand it, explain

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.010
it, predict it, or control it.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.540
So it seems to make sense from
a kind of MIT, model-centered

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.210
point of view.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.980
And only when you've got all
that straight do you start

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.700
working on your methods and
implement an experiment and

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.520
then go around that loop.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.320
So that's all I want to say by
way of review, I suppose.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.270
I want to take a minute or two
and just remind you of what's

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.880
on the final.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.110
And there's nothing to remind
because you all know what's on

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.565
the final already.

00:18:32.565 --> 00:18:37.040
We'll have four sections
corresponding with four exams.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.830
Then we'll have a fifth and
final question that will be

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.750
everything else.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.760
All that stuff you slept through
will be featured

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.740
there, as well a little problem
on Bayesian inference.

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:53.950
We rearranged the subject,
mostly so I could write the

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.400
demonstrations.

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.770
So that the Bayesian
stuff didn't come

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.100
before the fourth quiz.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.240
Therefore the Bayesian stuff
that you see on those previous

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.500
quizzes is likely to be harder
than the stuff that we'll ask

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.680
on the final, because you
haven't had as much experience

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.370
with it as people
did last year.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.280
I've got a few icons on
there to remind me to

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.200
tell you a few things.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.130
As always, open everything
except for computers.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.680
You can wear a costume.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.670
You can do anything you like as
long as it doesn't disturb

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.650
your neighbor, within reason.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.650
Well, I guess if it doesn't
disturb neighbor,

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:31.680
it is within reason.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.315
So maybe that's all
I need to say.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:37.730
I'm not sure where we're
going to be.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.920
But it's certainly the case
that, historically, there are

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.960
no visible clocks.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.050
So, we soon run out of all of
our cellphones, wrist watches,

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:48.450
and other time pieces
as we hand them out.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:52.430
So it pays to remember to bring
some kind of timepiece,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:56.120
because we won't be able to
convey the time very well.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.050
And finally, I see a little
calculator there.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.700
I don't recall any exam where
you actually needed a

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.300
calculator.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.270
But it's sort of a security
blanket to have one.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.510
People sometimes see a problem
and say, oh my God, what am I

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.960
going to do?

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.450
I left my calculator at home.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.990
So as to avoid that anxiety,
you might want to bring one

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.070
even though you won't need it.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.590
So that's the final.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.650
I'm sure there are
no questions.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:21.100
Are there?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.900
It's obvious.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.420
Everybody will do well.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.480
Two shots, that whole thing.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.790
Now, what to do next?

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.310
Suppose this subject
has turned you on.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.310
There are a variety of things
that you should be thinking

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.345
about doing next semester.

00:20:36.345 --> 00:20:39.790
And I wanted to review
just a few of those.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.770
One of them is Marvin Minsky's
subject, Society of Mind.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.920
It's very different
from this class.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.450
There are no prepared
lectures.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.690
Marvin doesn't rehearse.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:55.430
He doesn't think about what he's
going to say in advance.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.530
It's like this except
it's just a

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.000
conversation with Marvin.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.430
So many people find themselves
bored stiff for two lectures

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:08.650
out of three.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.720
But then in the third lecture,
Marvin will say something that

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.890
you'll think about for a year or
for the rest of your life.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.130
That's what happens to me.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.870
I'm bored stiff two
out three times.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.560
And then the third lecture he
says something, and I think

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.510
about it for at least a year
and maybe permanently.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.500
So it's an opportunity to see
one of MIT's true geniuses

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.300
think out loud.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:34.130
So it's an experience that you
don't want to miss because

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.470
that's what you come here
for, is to see the

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.970
geniuses think out loud.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.530
Speaking of geniuses, then
there's Bob Berwick.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.310
And he heroically is doing two
subjects in the spring.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.960
Both of which I'd
take if I could.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.090
One is his subject on Language
Understanding.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.920
And the reason I'd take that
is because I believe that

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.520
language is at the center of
any explanation of our

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.100
intelligence.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.330
So that's the subject I would
be, I suppose, most inclined

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.850
to take if I were you.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.460
Well, maybe Minsky's.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.330
It's hard to say.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.450
And incidentally, very
heroically, Bob is also

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.800
teaching a course on how
evolution works,

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.440
how it really works--

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.860
in so far as we know how
it really works--

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.380
as well.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:23.130
So both of those will be
offered in the spring.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.630
I don't know how he does it.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.720
I don't know how he does two
all at the same time.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.200
Of course there are lots of
places where you can go to

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.770
school, and the faculty will
be teaching five courses at

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.800
the same time.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.260
I just think they're
crazy or something.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.110
I don't know how that works.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.290
Gerry Sussman will be teaching
his Large Scale Symbolic

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.890
System subject.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.840
That's sometimes--

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:52.600
oh, I forgot what he wasn't
able to call it, something

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.340
that wasn't politically correct
about programming for

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.700
people who really, really
like to program.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.700
It's a splendid course on how
to build really big systems.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:06.250
And we use the ideas in that
subject in our research

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.970
system, because it's
the only way--

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.010
understanding how that works is
the only way that you can

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.845
build systems that are
too big to be built.

00:23:12.845 --> 00:23:16.050
I may say a word about
that a little later.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:21.030
So those are my favorite
three/four picks.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.450
But there's lots of
other stuff, too

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.090
many things to cover--

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.700
the media lab, [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.020
psychology.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.070
There's tons of stuff
out there.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.550
And I would only mention that
courses that have those three

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.880
names on them are bound
to be good.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.800
These are colleagues that I
think I have a important

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.860
perspective--

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.830
not necessarily one I agree
with, but an important

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.000
perspective that you
should understand--

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.300
Richards, Tenenbaum,
and Sinha.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.590
And now we come to my spring
course, the Human Intelligence

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.000
Enterprise.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.190
It's 6.XXX not because there's
anything pornographic about it

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:58.580
but because for a long time, I
couldn't remember it's number.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.610
So I developed a habit of
referring to it as 6.XXX and

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:02.860
it seems to have stuck.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.880
Here's what that's about.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:14.320
Yeah, that might
be interesting.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.330
It's taught like a humanities
course, though.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.320
No lectures, I just talk.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.975
And all the TAs are veterans of
that class so if you want

00:24:23.975 --> 00:24:28.030
to know if you should do it,
you have several resources.

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.390
You can talk to them.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:37.100
Or you could look at the sorts
of things we talk about.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.970
Here are some things we talk
about by way of packaging.

00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:47.940
Yeah, I can hear a little
tittering there because people

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.810
have discovered the
last element.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.750
Some people take the whole
subject because they want to

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.460
be present for that unit.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.280
And we talk about all those
kinds of things.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:02.370
And we look to see what the
common elements are in all

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.335
those kinds of packaging
problems of the sort that you

00:25:05.335 --> 00:25:09.290
will face over and over again
when you become an adult, no

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.470
matter what you do.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:16.010
If you become a business person,
an entrepreneur, a

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:21.360
military officer, a scientist,
or an engineer, that packaging

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.280
stuff will often make the
difference between whether you

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.530
succeed or don't.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.750
And then, that's the second way
you can figure out whether

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.480
you want to take the subject.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.330
The content, the TAs, and then
of course you can always

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.720
appeal to the Underground
Guide.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.080
And that's why it's very rare
for someone that takes 6.XXX

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.290
who hasn't been at this final
lecture because they read the

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.090
Underground Guide.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.370
Here is an element that appeared
in the Underground

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.840
Guide a few years back.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.500
There are no exams.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.930
But there is a tradition of
hacking the Underground Guide.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.910
So this is another example of
something that appeared.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.870
So it all came about because
early in the teaching of

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.250
6.XXX, I was whining to the
students about the fact that

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.490
I've been at MIT for a long
time, since I was freshman.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.480
And I still have yet to have
any person I report to say

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.210
anything about my teaching--

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.230
good, bad, indifferent.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.540
Nothing.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.010
Not a word.

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.950
So the students decided that it
would be interesting to see

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.400
if they could say something
sufficiently outrageous to

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.140
force a conversation between
the department

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.750
chairman and me.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.730
And so far they've been
totally unsuccessful.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.490
And I've tried everything.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.605
Winston shows up late if
he shows up at all.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.740
Good instructor but constantly
sipping from

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:12.990
a brown paper bag.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.360
All kinds of stuff.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.430
But there it is.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.910
It's a lot of fun.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.220
It's a little oversubscribed so
we have to have a lottery

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.560
and there's about 50% chance
and so on and so forth.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.410
But many of you will find
it a good thing to do.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:37.780
Oh, yeah.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:42.150
And now I also want to remind
myself that there is a IP

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.690
event that's become kind
of MIT tradition.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.030
It's the How to Speak
lecture that I give.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:51.690
This year it'll be on
January 28 in 6120.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:59.850
6120 holds about 120 people
and about 250 show up.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.670
So if you want to go to that
lecture you should show up 15

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.380
minutes early.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.030
That's a little secret just
between me and 6034 students.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.990
It's about packaging, too.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.350
It's a one-lecture
version of 6.XXX.

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:16.890
But it's very nonlinear because
one thing that you

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.860
pick up from that one hour may
make the difference between

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.480
you getting the job and some
other slug getting the job.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.240
So it's one of those sorts of
things that can make a big

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.670
difference in a short
period of time.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.240
You may sleep through 50 minutes
of the 55 minutes in

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.450
that lecture and stay awake
for that one magical five

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.250
minutes when you learn something
about when to tell a

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:45.870
joke or how to open a lecture
or how to conclude one or a

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.400
job talk or a sales presentation
or anything.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.580
And that will make it
worthwhile for you.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.440
And then of course there's
the possibility of your--

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.530
anybody who's doing [? UROP ?]

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:02.000
with me is likely to be
interested in what I've

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.600
recently come to call a strong
story hypothesis, something

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.320
that we've talked about
from time to time.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.470
That's what makes us humans, and
that's not what they are.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.630
They're orangutans or
chimpanzees, even though the

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.020
DNA that we share is--

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.580
it goes up and down.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.760
At one point it was 96%,
then it went to 98%.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.610
Now I think it's back
down to 97%.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.160
But whatever we are, it's not
because of a huge, massive

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.380
difference in DNA between
us and our cousins.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.870
So in my group we
build a Genesis

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:42.300
system, modestly called.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.550
And that's what it looks like.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.490
And it has in it all the sorts
of things that we've talked

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.100
about from time to
time in 6034.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.730
And it's about to move into
areas that are especially

00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:00.250
interesting, like can you detect
the onset of a possible

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.110
disaster before it happens
and intervene?

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:06.580
Can you retrieve presses based
on higher-level concepts?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.830
Things of that sort.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.340
Would you like to see
a demonstration?

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:14.180
OK.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.700
So you've see in a little
bit of this before.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.410
In fact, I'm not even sure
what exactly I've

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.060
already shown you.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.396
Let me just get over there
to see what goes on here.

00:30:24.396 --> 00:30:29.680
What I'm going to do right now
is I'm just going to read

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.222
about Macbeth.

00:30:31.222 --> 00:30:34.220
A short precis of the plot.

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:36.060
Not the whole thing,
of course.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.520
Just a few sentences
about the plot.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.420
Right now what it's doing is
absorbing the English and

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.612
translating into a sort
of internal language.

00:30:46.612 --> 00:30:50.500
A sort of universal, internal
language that's all about

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.280
trajectories and transitions
and social

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.370
relationships and all that.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:00.800
So it's being read there by
two different persona.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.000
Each of those personas has
a different educational

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.040
background, you might say.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.690
They might represent
different cultures.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.060
So eventually they build
up graphs like that.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.790
And everything in white
is stuff that's

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.580
explicit in the story.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.495
And everything that's in grey is
stuff that's been inferred

00:31:19.495 --> 00:31:21.520
by the system.

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.220
So there are several layers
of understanding.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.040
One is what's there
explicitly.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.510
And the other thing that's
there is stuff

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:29.415
that's readily inferred.

00:31:29.415 --> 00:31:32.350
And because these persona have
different educational

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.681
backgrounds, you might say
they see the killing of

00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:41.490
Macbeth at the end of the
play in a different

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.540
light from one another.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.870
One sees it as an act of insane
violence and the other

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:50.440
sees it as a consequence
of a revenge.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.680
So once you've got that
capability, you can do all

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.240
sorts of things.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.470
For example, you can
ask questions.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.080
So let me arrange it to ask--
by the way, this is a live

00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.455
demonstration.

00:31:59.455 --> 00:32:03.250
I'm thrilled to pieces that
it actually works so far.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.050
Let's see.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:16.600
Why did Macbeth kill Duncan?

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.850
You all know why, right?

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:23.400
Yeah, you're right.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.400
He didn't actually do that.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.400
On a common sense level, neither
Dr. Jeckll nor Mr.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.065
Hyde have an opinion.

00:32:29.065 --> 00:32:32.420
On a reflective level neither
Dr. Jeckll more Mr. Hyde have

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.000
an opinion.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.580
That's because it
didn't happen.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.280
So we call these two persona
Doctor Jeckll and Mr. Hyde.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.620
And you're ready to complain
right away about the spelling

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:44.990
of Jeckll, aren't you?

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.220
Well, that's because with this
spelling the speech generator

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.550
makes it sound a little bit more
like when we say Jekyll.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.398
But what really happened is that
Macduff killed Macbeth.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.520
On a common sense level, it
looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.730
Macduff kills Macbeth because
Macduff is insane.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.570
It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks
Macduff kills Macbeth because

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.710
Macbeth angers Macduff.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:13.410
On a reflective level, it looks
like Dr. Jeckll thinks

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:17.460
Macduff kills Macbeth as part of
an act of insane violence.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.700
It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks
Macduff kills Macbeth as part

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.180
of acts of mistake, Pyrrhic
victory, and revenge.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.440
Isn't that cool?

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.240
I bet you'd get an A if you had
said that in eighth grade.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.500
But once you've got this ability
to understand the

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.380
story from multiple points of
view, you begin to think of

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.090
all kinds of wonderful
things you can do.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.610
For example, you can have Dr.
Jeckll negotiate with Mr.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.950
Hyde, because Dr. Jeckll will
be able to understand Mr.

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.220
Hyde's point of view and
demonstrate to Mr. Hyde that

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:57.960
he thinks that point of
view is legitimate.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.650
Or, Dr. Jeckll can teach Mr.
Hyde the subject matter of a

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.740
new domain.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:10.290
Or Dr. Jeckll can watch what's
happening in Mr. Hyde's mind

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:13.020
and avert disaster before
it happens.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:17.770
So let me just show you another
situation here.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.630
I want to turn on the onset
detector and read another

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.219
little snippet.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:23.620
This one is about--

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.870
what should I do?

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.820
We'll do the Russia and
Estonia cyber war.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.820
It's reading background
knowledge right now.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.850
But pretty soon, in the upper
left-hand corner, as it begins

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.250
to read the story, you'll see
it spotting the onset of

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.739
potential revenge operations
or potential Pyrrhic

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:49.370
victories, and show their
foundations begin to emerge

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:54.790
and giving the system an
opportunity to intervene.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:56.540
So there you can see all
the things that it

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.690
thinks might happen.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.370
Not all of them do happen.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.773
But some of them do.

00:35:02.773 --> 00:35:06.820
And you'll note, incidentally,
that this is another case of

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.900
Dr. Jeckll and Mr. Hyde having
different cultural

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.440
perspectives.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.300
One's an ally of Russia and
one's an ally of Estonia.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.650
One sees it as unwarranted
revenge and the other sees it

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.180
as teaching a lesson.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:21.480
So, I don't know.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.970
What else have we got here?

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.540
Oh yeah, president recall.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.880
A long time ago, we talked
about doing information

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.210
retrieval based on vectors
of keyword counts.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.860
That's cool but not this cool.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:37.780
This is doing it on vectors of
concepts that appear in the

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.540
stories, such as revenge, even
though the word revenge

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.160
doesn't appear anywhere.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.750
So because we're able to
understand the story on

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.860
multiple levels, we can use
those higher levels that don't

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.010
involve the words in the
story at all to drive

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.980
the retrieval process.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.510
So all that is a consequence of
a variety of things, one of

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:04.340
which is the specialists that
translate the English into an

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.200
internal language.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.360
And it's also, incidentally--

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:09.330
I mentioned it a
little before--

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.910
it's also a consequence of our
use of Gerry Sussman's

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.740
propagator architecture.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.465
So a student comes into
our group and says

00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:18.060
he wants to do something.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.870
And we say OK, here's how
the system is organized.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.560
It's like a bunch of boxes
that are wired together.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.250
So you get a box and we'll tell
you what the inputs are

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.300
going to look like.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.690
And we'll tell you what we
want on the outputs.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:34.370
And if you don't like the
inputs, just ignore them.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.630
And if we don't like
your outputs,

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.500
we'll just ignore that.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.210
So nobody can screw up anything
because they have a

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:43.520
very circumscribed piece of
the system to work with.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:52.110
So I can say, for example, the
president wanted Iraq to move

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.640
toward democracy.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.120
And bingo.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.800
That starts a propagation
through that network.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:09.802
All this would be unconvincing,
in my view, if

00:37:09.802 --> 00:37:11.810
it weren't eventually connected
to perception.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.270
Because if it's not eventually
connected with perception,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.580
it's yet another system that
demonstrates how smart it can

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.420
seem to be without actually
knowing anything.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:25.780
So another half of what we do
is an early stage attempt to

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:28.410
connect the language stuff with
things that are going on

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.720
in the world.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.950
So we say, imagine
a jumping action.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.640
And there is a jumping action
that's part of a test sweep

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.240
developed by the Defense
Research Projects Agency to

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:43.120
drive what they call the Mind's
Eye program, which was

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.090
developed largely as a
consequence of work done here

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.770
at MIT, focused on the idea
that if we're going to

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.370
understand the nature of
intelligence, we have to

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.090
understand how language is
coupled into our perceptual

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:56.580
systems and how those perceptual
systems can answer

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.830
questions posed to them by
the language system.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.710
That's a little demo of
the Genesis system.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.740
Here are the issues that we're
trying to explore.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.530
Nothing too serious, just
the nature of what is

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.270
extraordinarily fundamental
to any

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.650
explanation of human thinking.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.050
Now, all of this might
turn you on.

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.370
And you say to me, well, you're
sick and tired of MIT.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.290
You'd like to go somewhere
else for graduate school.

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.900
So now that I've demonstrated
what we do here, one of the

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:34.360
many things we do here, I'll
talk a little bit about other

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.200
places you can go.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.230
This is a sort of MIT-centric
view of the world.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.250
It represents all of the
places you could go

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:44.500
when I was a kid.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:48.490
But while I've got
this particular

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.990
diagram on here, I just--

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:51.670
sort of testing my
MIT arrogance--

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.330
I remember a story
often told by my

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.025
colleague Peter Szolovits.

00:38:56.025 --> 00:38:59.770
He says that when he came to a
job interview from Caltech to

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.330
MIT, he was sitting here
for three days and

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.210
nobody spoke to him.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.740
So eventually he said, I've
got to do something.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.960
He walked up to a graduate
student and said, hi my name

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.375
is Peter Szolovits.

00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:13.370
I'm from Caltech.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:14.940
And the graduate student
said, Caltech

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.190
sucks, and walked away.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:23.740
Anyway, we've populated all
these places now that you see

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.040
here, and more.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.910
This is just a list that I
scratched up this morning.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:32.490
I'm sure I've forgotten many
that have equal right

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.810
to be on this list.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.190
But in the end, which one you go
to depends on who you want

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.270
to apprentice yourself to.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.100
Because a graduate school
is an apprenticeship.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.560
And that means if you go to a
place with just one person,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.990
it's OK if that's the person
you want to apprentice

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.210
yourself to.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.450
Each of these places has a
different focus because they

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.790
have different people.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.260
So you need to find out if
there's somebody at any of

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.900
these places.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:00.340
It doesn't matter if it's
AI or some other field.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.930
Theoretical physic-- you've
got to find out if there's

00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:03.570
somebody at that place
you want to

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:04.480
apprentice yourself to.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:07.380
So those site visits are
really important.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.110
And I would like to also stress
that when you make your

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:13.310
application to graduate school,
it's very different

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:16.030
from applying to undergraduate
school.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.870
Because they don't care whether
their school is good

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:21.650
for you at all.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.480
They only care about
one thing--

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.450
whether you're good
for their school.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:28.190
So don't get confused and
talk about how it's a

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.060
wonderful fit for you.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.360
Because what they're interested
in is whether

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.520
you're going to contribute to
their research program.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.490
Oh, I should say that if you're
applying to artificial

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.870
intelligence that means you
don't say, I'm interested in

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.900
all aspects of thinking.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.240
You need to be focused.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.630
There's another reason why
you don't say that you're

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:50.180
interested in all aspects of
thinking and that is the

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:53.820
defect theory of AI
career selection.

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:57.800
It seems to be the case, strange
though it may seem,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.960
that people in artificial
intelligence often specialize

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.050
their research on the things
that they don't do very well

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.880
themselves.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.020
So people who study language,
with the exception of Bob

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.790
Berwick, often have
trouble getting

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:12.180
out a coherent sentence.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.140
And people who do hand-eye
coordination are the sorts who

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.540
spill their coffee.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:24.530
So don't say you want to study
all thinking because--

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:28.390
The most extreme case of
this, though, is--

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:30.370
if you don't mind, I'll tell you
a story about an extreme

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.740
case in this.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.360
We had a visitor from Japan
in the old artificial

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.920
intelligence lab
many years ago.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.000
He came for a year.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.080
Let's call him Yoshiaki,
just to pick a name.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.760
Yoshiaki spent a year at the
artificial intelligence lab,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.300
and he left his wife in Japan.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.752
And the reason was,
she was pregnant.

00:41:50.752 --> 00:41:54.360
And at that time, you could not
get a visa to the United

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.240
States unless you had a
smallpox vaccination.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.990
And because she was pregnant,
she didn't want to get a

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:03.650
smallpox vaccination because
there's a small danger to the

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.485
fetus if you get a smallpox
vaccination

00:42:05.485 --> 00:42:07.000
while you're pregnant.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.060
So she stayed back there.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.580
So Yoshiaki, let us call him--

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:12.960
it was a day before he
was to get on the

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.950
airplane to go home.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.190
I walked into his office and
his desk was covered with

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.080
pictures of his wife.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.630
By the way, Yoshiaki, I should
tell you, is a computer vision

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.405
guy, interested in object
recognition.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:29.030
So you might suspect he
has some problem.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.140
So he's looking at
these pictures.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.880
I thought, oh my God, this
is a tender moment.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.140
He's anticipating his
return to Japan and

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.140
reunion with his wife.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.620
So I muttered something
to that effect.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.530
And then he looked at me like
I was the king of the fools.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.470
And he said, it's not a
question tenderness.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.880
I'm afraid I won't recognize
her at the Tokyo airport.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.220
So I said, Yoshiaki.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.720
How can this be?

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.260
You study computer vision.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.930
You study object recognition.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.400
This is your wife.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.395
How can you think you wouldn't
recognize her

00:43:00.395 --> 00:43:03.220
at the Tokyo airport?

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.370
And then he looks at me, and--

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.840
God is my witness-- he says,
they all look alike.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.860
Well now as we come
close to the end,

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.680
what are the big questions?

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.130
Is it useful?

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.310
Of course it's useful.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.630
It's part of the toolkit, now,
of everybody who claims to be

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.310
a computer scientist.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.730
What are the powerful ideas
and these things?

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:30.290
Well, here's the most powerful,
powerful idea is the

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:33.200
idea of powerful idea.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.450
And here are a few
of my favorites.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.930
No surprises there.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.180
That's just Winston's picks.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.340
But there's one more I
would like to add.

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.100
And that is all great
ideas are simple.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.770
A lot of times we at MIT confuse
value with complexity.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:53.660
And many of the things that
were the simplest in this

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.860
subject are actually
the most powerful.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:05.160
So be careful about confusing
simplicity with triviality and

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.000
thinking that something can't
be important unless it's

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.580
complicated and deeply
mathematical.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.270
It's usually the intuition
that's powerful, and the

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.380
mathematics is the [INAUDIBLE]
element.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:22.090
Sometimes people argue that real
intelligence is possible.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.700
One of the most common arguments
is, well what if we

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.170
had a room?

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.630
And you're in the room and
you're asked to translate some

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:29.890
Chinese documents.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:31.140
You've got a bunch of books.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:34.920
And in the end you could
do the translation.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.750
But you cannot be said to
understand Chinese.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:43.260
This is the argument
of Berkeley

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.510
philosopher named Sorel.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.200
So the trouble is,
it's also true--

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.950
well, the argument is the books
aren't intelligent.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.900
They're just ink on a page.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.300
And the person is just a
computer, just a processor.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.360
It doesn't actually
know anything.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.660
So since it can't be in either
the person or the

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.436
books, it can't be.

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:10.410
And that just forgets that
there's a magic that comes

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.940
about when a running program,
when a process, executes in

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.980
time over knowledge that it
continually contributes to.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.680
So the reductionist arguments
are among the many that have

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.630
been ineffectually posed to
argue that artificial

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:27.880
intelligence is impossible.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.990
But that bears longer
discussion.

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.980
Let me just bring up the biggest
issue in my mind,

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.890
which is, it's not the question
of whether we humans

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.260
are too smart to have our
intelligence duplicated or

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.180
excelled in a computer.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.780
It's a question whether we're
smart enough to pull it off.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:54.096
I once had a pet raccoon.

00:45:54.096 --> 00:45:56.110
Now, it's illegal to
have a pet raccoon.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.710
But this one was an orphan.

00:45:58.710 --> 00:46:01.510
Its mother had been hit
by a car or something.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.772
A friend of mine brought the
raccoon to me knowing I kind

00:46:03.772 --> 00:46:05.900
of like animals.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:08.600
And I have to say, I kept
the raccoon for a year.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.250
At that point, she wanted to
go out and be on her own.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.840
So I had this raccoon.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.760
And this raccoon is smarter than
any dog I've ever had.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.620
Within a day, she learned
how to pry the

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.670
refrigerator door open.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.150
So I spent that whole year
taping the refrigerator door

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.810
shut every time.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.460
And then, we'd play jokes
on each other.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.440
She wouldn't eat hot dogs.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.030
And I wanted her to eat hot
dogs desperately because

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.880
they're cheap and
easy to serve.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.300
All she would eat was cooked
chicken wings,

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.020
wouldn't eat hot dogs.

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.755
So one day I said, well, I'm
going to play a trick on her.

00:46:44.755 --> 00:46:45.950
I took a chicken bone.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.790
I stuck it in the middle of
a hot dog and put it in a

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:48.770
garbage can.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:49.800
And she went for it.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.705
Her genes took over and
she went for it.

00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:55.390
And she was happy with
hot dogs ever after.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.790
She wouldn't let me read.

00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:03.050
She would crawl up underneath
the book and

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:05.140
interfere and make me--

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.480
she always wanted to suck on
my thumb, which turned blue

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.070
eventually.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:12.320
You'd be amazed at how much
a raccoon can suck.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:14.610
It's just extremely powerful.

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.540
The best parts were when she
would go bike riding with me.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.040
I put on a heavy sweater
because they have

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.900
a pretty good grip.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:24.710
I'd put on a heavy sweater and
she'd kind of mount herself on

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.440
my back and look out over my
shoulder, stopped traffic for

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.690
miles around.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.460
So she was really smart.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:36.960
But the interesting thing is
that at no point did I ever

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.460
presume that that raccoon was
smart enough to build a

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.420
machine that was as smart
as a raccoon.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.790
So when we think that we can, it
involves a certain element

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:48.320
of hubris that may or may
not be justified.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.730
Well, there it is.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.880
Just a couple more
things to do.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:48:03.005
One of which is, you should
understand that Kendra and

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:09.610
Kenny and Yuan and Martin and
Gleb are doing a lot of stuff

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.846
that's outside their
job description.

00:48:11.846 --> 00:48:17.290
All of these quiz review deals
that they've arranged are not

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:18.300
in their job description.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.800
I didn't ask them to do it.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.710
That's all just plain
old professionalism.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.120
So they've been wonderful
to work with and

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.085
I'd just like to--

00:48:25.085 --> 00:48:36.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.710
--offer them a round
of applause.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:44.180
And of course, Bob and Randy
and Mark have done fabulous

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.810
stuff as well.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:54.520
And we of the staff, the TAs,
Mark, Bob, and Randy, have

00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:01.360
nothing else to do except wish
you good hunting on the final

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.350
and a good long winter solstice
hibernation period

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:07.270
after that.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.420
And that is the end
of the story.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.620
And we hope you live
happily ever after.
