00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:12.580
SPEAKER 1: It was about 1963
when a noted philosopher here

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.885
at MIT, named Hubert Dreyfus--

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:30.330
Hubert Dreyfus wrote a paper in
about 1963 in which he had

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.610
a heading titled, "Computers
Can't Play Chess." Of course,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.110
he was subsequently invited
over to the artificial

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.670
intelligence laboratory
to play the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.420
Greenblatt chess machine.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.650
And, of course, he lost.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.200
Whereupon Seymour Pavitt wrote
a rebuttal to Dreyfus' famous

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.240
paper, which had a subject
heading, "Dreyfus Can't Play

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.840
Chess Either."

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.390
But in a strange sense, Dreyfus
might have been right

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.000
and would have been right if he
were to have said computers

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.690
can't play chess the way
humans play chess yet.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.630
In any case, around about 1968
a chess master named David

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.000
Levy bet noted founder of
artificial intelligence John

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.440
McCarthy that no computer would
beat the world champion

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.730
within 10 years.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.740
And five years later, McCarthy
gave up, because it had

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.510
already become clear that no
computer would win in a way

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.590
that McCarthy wanted it to win,
that is to say by playing

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.960
chess the way humans
play chess.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.160
But then 20 years after that
in 1997, Deep Blue beat the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.160
world champion, and chess
suddenly became uninteresting.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.690
But we're going to talk about
games today, because there are

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.720
elements of game-play that do
model some of the things that

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.750
go on in our head.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.050
And if they don't model things
that go on in our head, they

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.610
do model some kind
of intelligence.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.490
And if we're to have a general
understanding of what

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.690
intelligence is all about, we
have to understand that kind

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.000
of intelligence, too.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.790
So, we'll start out by talking
about various ways that we

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.330
might design a computer
program to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360
play a game like chess.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.930
And we'll conclude by talking
a little bit about what Deep

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.460
Blue adds to the mix other
than tremendous speed.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.300
So, that's our agenda.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.320
By the end of the hour, you'll
understand and be able to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.290
write your own Deep Blue
if you feel like it.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.270
First, we want to talk about how
it might be possible for a

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.590
computer to play chess.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.250
Let's talk about several
approaches

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220
that might be possible.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.860
Approach number one is that
the machine might make a

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.980
description of the board the
same way a human would; talk

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.000
about pawn structure, King
safety, whether it's a good

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.960
time to castle, that
sort of thing.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:12.130
So, it would be analysis and
perhaps some strategy mixed up

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.380
with some tactics.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.190
And all that would get mixed
up and, finally, result in

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.710
some kind of move.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.450
If this is the game board, the
next thing to do would be

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.400
determined by some process
like that.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.730
And the trouble is no one
knows how to do it.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.180
And so in that sense,
Dreyfus is right.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.830
None the game playing programs
today incorporate any of that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.350
kind of stuff.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.600
And since nobody knows
how to do that, we

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.420
can't talk about it.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.610
So we can talk about
other ways, though,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.830
that we might try.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.450
For example, we can have
if-then rules.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.740
How would that work?

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.840
That would work this way.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.770
You look at the board,
represented by this node here,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:09.970
and you say, well, if it's
possible to move the Queen

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.390
pawn forward by one,
then do that.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.010
So, it doesn't do any of
evaluation of the board.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.290
It doesn't try anything.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.360
It just says let me look at the
board and select a move on

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.170
that basis.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.130
So, that would be a way
of approaching a game

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760
situation like this.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.430
Here's the situation.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.060
Here are the possible moves.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.130
And one is selected
on the basis of an

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.180
if-then rule like so.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.195
And nobody can make a very
strong chess player

00:04:42.195 --> 00:04:43.350
that works like that.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.100
Curiously enough, someone has
made a pretty good checkers

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.326
playing program that
works like that.

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:53.110
It checks to see what moves are
available on the board,

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.290
ranks them, and picks the
highest one available.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.920
But, in general, that's not
a very good approach.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.860
It's not very powerful.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.670
You couldn't make it--

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.900
well, when I say, couldn't, it
means I can't think of any way

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.530
that you could make a
strong chess playing

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.780
program that way.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:19.055
So, the third way to do this is
to look ahead and evaluate.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.410
What that means is you
look ahead like so.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.790
You see all the possible
consequences of moves, and you

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.740
say, which of these board
situations is best for me?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.210
So, that would be an approach
that comes in here like so and

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.780
says, which one of those three
situations is best?

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.990
And to do that, we have to have
some way of evaluating

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.770
the situation deciding which
of those is best.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.710
Now, I want to do a little,
brief aside, because I want to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.670
talk about the mechanisms that
are popularly used to do that

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.420
kind of evaluation.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.560
In the end, there are lots of
features of the chessboard.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.680
Let's call them f1,
f2, and so on.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.380
And we might form some function
of those features.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.190
And that, overall, is called
the static value.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.400
So, it's static because you're
not exploring any consequences

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.250
of what might happen.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.525
You're just looking at the board
as it is, checking the

00:06:22.525 --> 00:06:25.080
King's safety, checking
the pawn structure.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.440
Each of those produces a number
fed into this function,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.380
out comes a value.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.960
And that is a value of the
board seen from your

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.160
perspective.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.370
Now, normally, this function,
g, is reduced to a linear

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.990
polynomial.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.330
So, in the end, the most popular
kind of way of forming

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.120
a static value is to take f1,
multiply it times some

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.290
constant, c1, add c2, multiply
it times f2.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.973
And that is a linear
scoring polynomial.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.610
So, we could use that function
to produce numbers from each

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.150
of these things and then pick
the highest number.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.640
And that would be a way
of playing the game.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.220
Actually, a scoring polynomial
is a little bit

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.940
more than we need.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.910
Because all we really need is
a method that looks at those

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.990
three boards and says,
I like this one best.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.490
It doesn't have to rank them.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.340
It doesn't have to give
them numbers.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.500
All it has to do is say which
one it likes best.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.690
So, one way of doing that is
to use a linear scoring

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.240
polynomial.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.940
But it's not the only
way of doing that.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.980
So, that's number two
and number three.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.410
But now what else might we do?

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.210
Well, if we reflect back on some
of the searches we talked

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.320
about, what's the base case
against which everything else

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:07.800
is compared much the way of
doing search that doesn't

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.910
require any intelligence,
just brute force?

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.630
We could use the British Museum
algorithm and simply

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.770
evaluate the entire tree of
possibilities; I move, you

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.540
move, I move, you move,
all the way down to--

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.726
what?--

00:08:25.726 --> 00:08:28.800
maybe 100, 50 moves.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.770
You do 50 things.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.750
I do 50 things.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.500
So, before we can decide if
that's a good idea or not, we

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.754
probably ought to develop
some vocabulary.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:58.000
So, consider this
tree of moves.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.530
There will be some
number of choices

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.285
considered at each level.

00:09:04.285 --> 00:09:07.250
And there will be some
number of levels.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.910
So, the standard language for
this as we call this the

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.160
branching factor.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.340
And in this particular case,
b is equal to 3.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:30.250
This is the depth of the tree.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.280
And, in this case, d is two.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.750
So, now that produces a certain
number of terminal or

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.000
leaf nodes.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.875
How many of those are there?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.170
Well, that's pretty simple
computation.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.840
It's just b to the d.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.330
Right, Christopher,
b to the d?

00:09:55.330 --> 00:10:01.660
So, if you have b to the d at
this level, you have one.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.670
b to the d at this level,
you have b.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.020
b to the d at this level, you
have [? d ?] squared.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:14.030
So, b to the d, in this
particular case, is 9.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:19.310
So, now we can use this
vocabulary that we've

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.770
developed to talk about whether
it's reasonable to

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.990
just do the British Museum
algorithm, be done with it,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.500
forget about chess,
and go home.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.750
Well, let's see.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.050
It's pretty deep down there.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:39.290
If we think about chess, and we
think about a standard game

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.970
which each person does
50 things, that

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.080
gives a d about 100.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.490
And if you think about the
branching factor in chess,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.430
it's generally presumed to be,
depending on the stage of the

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.870
game and so on and so forth,
it varies, but it might

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.940
average around 14 or 15.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.620
If it were just 10, that would
be 10 to the 100th.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.310
But it's a little more than
that, because the branching

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.930
factor is more than 10.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:09.300
So, in the end, it looks like,
according to Claude Shannon,

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:16.160
there are about 10 to the 120th
leaf nodes down there.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.930
And if you're going to go to a
British Museum treatment of

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.990
this tree, you'd have to do
10 to the 120th static

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:28.310
evaluations down there at the
bottom if you're going to see

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.080
which one of the moves
is best at the top.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.850
Is that a reasonable number?

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.622
It didn't used to seem
practicable.

00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:41.460
It used to seem impossible.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.400
But now we've got cloud
computing and everything.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.180
And maybe we could actually
do that, right?

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.440
What do you think, Vanessa, can
you do that, get enough

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.940
computers going in the cloud?

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.385
No?

00:11:55.385 --> 00:11:57.150
You're not sure?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.350
Should we work it out?

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.520
Let's work it out.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.170
I'll need some help, especially
from any of you who

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.420
are studying cosmology.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.470
So, we'll start with
how many atoms are

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.720
there in the universe?

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.890
Volunteers?

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:15.790
10 to the--

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:16.792
SPEAKER 2: 10 to the 38th?

00:12:16.792 --> 00:12:19.300
SPEAKER 1: No, no, 10 to the
38th has been offered.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.376
That's why it's way too low.

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:25.760
The last time I looked, it was
about 10 to the 80th atoms in

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.010
the universe.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.900
The next thing I'd like to know
is how many seconds are

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.232
there in a year?

00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:41.200
It's a good number
have memorized.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:53.350
That number is approximately
pi times 10 to the seventh.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.190
So, how many nanoseconds
in a second?

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:03.410
That gives us 10 to the ninth.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.670
At last, how many years
are there in the

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.920
history of the universe?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.480
SPEAKER 3: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.790
14.7 billion.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.150
SPEAKER 1: She offers something
on the order of 10

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.960
billion, maybe 14 billion.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.130
But we'll say 10 billion to make
our calculation simple.

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:31.630
That's 10 to the 10th years.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:38.300
If we will add that up, 80, 90,
plus 16, that's 10 to the

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:50.540
106th nanoseconds in the history
of the universe.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.580
Multiply it times the number
of atoms in the universe.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.900
So, if all of the atoms in the
universe were doing static

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.740
evaluations at nanosecond speeds
since the beginning of

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.640
the Big Bang, we'd still be 14
orders of magnitudes short.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.120
So, it'd be a pretty
good cloud.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.395
It would have to harness
together lots of universes.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.660
So, the British Museum
algorithm is

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:17.910
not going to work.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.700
No good.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.460
So, what we're going to have to
do is we're going to have

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.090
to put some things together
and hope for the best.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.680
So, the fifth way is the way
we're actually going to do it.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:53.580
And what we're going to do is
we're going to look ahead, not

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.410
just one level, but as
far as possible.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.460
We consider, not only the
situation that we've developed

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:15.390
here, but we'll try to push that
out as far as we can and

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:21.430
look at these static values of
the leaf nodes down here and

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.970
somehow use that as a way
of playing the game.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.885
So, that is number five.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.830
And number four is going
all the way down there.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.850
And this, in the end, is
all that we can do.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:45.240
This idea is multiply invented
most notably by Claude Shannon

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:51.150
and also by Alan Turing, who,
I found out from a friend of

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:56.460
mine, spent a lot a lunch time
conversations talking with

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:01.130
each other about how a computer
might play chess

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.850
against the future when there
would be computers.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.300
So, Donald, Mickey and Alan
Turing also invented this over

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.010
lunch while they were taking
some time off from cracking

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:14.730
the German codes.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.710
Well, what is the method?

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.290
I want to illustrate the method
with the simplest

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.700
possible tree.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.600
So, we're going to have a
branching factor of 2 not 14.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.920
And we're going to have a
depth of 2 not something

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.570
highly serious.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.360
Here's the game tree.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.510
And there are going
to be some numbers

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.760
down here at the bottom.

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.390
And these are going to be the
value of the board from the

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.060
perspective of the player
at the top.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.210
Let us say that the player at
the top would like to drive

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:52.330
the play as much as possible
toward the big numbers.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.750
So, we're going to call that
player the maximizing player.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.270
He would like to get over here
to the 8, because that's the

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.940
biggest number.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.740
There's another player, his
opponent, which we'll call the

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.440
minimizing player.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.109
And he's hoping that the play
will go down to the board

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.950
situation that's as
small as possible.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.930
Because his view is the opposite
of the maximizing

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.040
player, hence the
name minimax.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.770
But how does it work?

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.520
Do you see which way the
play is going to go?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.990
How do you decide which way
the play is going to go?

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.650
Well, it's not obvious
at a glance.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.230
Do you see which way
it's going to go?

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.980
It's not obvious
to the glance.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.160
But if we do more than a glance,
if we look at the

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.150
situation from the perspective
of the minimizing player here

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.360
at the middle level, it's
pretty clear that if the

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.570
minimizing player finds himself
in that situation,

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.480
he's going to choose
to go that way.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.830
And so the value of this
situation, from the

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.652
perspective of the minimizing
player, is 2.

00:18:00.652 --> 00:18:03.480
He'd never go over
there to the 7.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.200
Similarly, if the minimizing
player is over here with a

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.700
choice between going toward
a 1 or toward an 8, he'll

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.900
obviously go toward a 1.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.850
And so the value of that board
situation, from the

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.340
perspective of the minimizing
player, is 1.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.550
Now, we've taken the scores down
here at the bottom of the

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.710
tree, and we back them
up one level.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.840
And you see how we can
just keep doing this?

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.160
Now the maximizing player can
see that if he goes to the

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.605
left, he gets a score of 2.

00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:37.360
If he goes to the right, he
only gets a score of 1.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.800
So, he's going to
go to the left.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.980
So, overall, then, the
maximizing player is going to

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.790
have a 2 as the perceived value
of that situation there

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.740
at the top.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.790
That's the minimax algorithm.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.390
It's very simple.

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.250
You go down to the bottom of the
tree, you compute static

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.570
values, you back them up level
by level, and then you decide

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.585
where to go.

00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:05.390
And in this particular
situation, the maximizer goes

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.890
to the left.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.770
And the minimizer goes to the
left, too, so the play ends up

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.680
here, far short of the 8 that
the maximizer wanted and less

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.460
than the 1 that the
minimizer wanted.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.100
But this is an adversarial
game.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.230
You're competing with
each other.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.280
So, you don't expect to get
what you want, right?

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.660
So, maybe we ought to see if
we can make that work.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.100
There's a game tree.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.350
Do you see how it goes?

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.730
Let's see if the system
can figure it out.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.350
There it goes, crawling its
way through the tree.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.310
This is a branching factor of
2, just like our sample, but

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.540
now four levels.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.700
You can see that it's got quite
a lot of work to do.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:01.175
That's 2 to the fourth, one,
two, three, four, 2 to the

00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:06.790
fourth, 16 static evaluations
to do.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.850
So, it found the answer.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.120
But it's a lot of work.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.290
We could get a new tree and
restart it, maybe speed it up.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.310
There is goes down that
way, get a new tree.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.270
Those are just random numbers.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.360
So, each time it's going to find
a different path through

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.330
the tree according to the
numbers that it's generated.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.070
Now, 16 isn't bad.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.620
But if you get down there around
10 levels deep and your

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.850
branching factor is 14, well,
we know those numbers get

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.290
pretty awful pretty bad, because
the number of static

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.105
evaluations to do down
there at the bottom

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:43.830
goes as b to the d.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.080
It's exponential.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.350
And time has shown, if you get
down about seven or eight

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.845
levels, you're a jerk.

00:20:51.845 --> 00:20:54.450
And if you get down about 15
or 16 levels, you beat the

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.900
world champion.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.630
So, you'd like to get as far
down in the tree as possible.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.480
Because when you get as far
down into the tree as

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.510
possible, what happens is as
these that these crude

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:09.720
measures of bored quality
begin to clarify.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.910
And, in fact, when you get far
enough, the only thing that

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.890
really counts is piece count,
one of those features.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.750
If you get far enough, piece
count and a few other things

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.150
will give you a pretty good idea
of what to do if you get

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:23.990
far enough.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.510
But getting far enough
can be a problem.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.400
So, we want to do everything
we can to

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.935
get as far as possible.

00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:31.970
We want to pull out every trick
we can find to get as

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.500
far as possible.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:38.450
Now, you remember when we talked
about branching down,

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.955
we knew that there were some
things that we could do that

00:21:39.955 --> 00:21:43.330
would cut off whole portions
of the search tree.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.380
So, what we'd like to do is find
something analogous to

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.270
this world of games, so we cut
off whole portions of this

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.880
search tree, so we don't
have to look at

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.180
those static values.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.330
What I want to do is I want to
come back and redo this thing.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.780
But this time, I'm going
to compute the static

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.030
values one at a time.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.190
I've got the same structure
in the tree.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.110
And just as before, I'm going to
assume that the top player

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.490
wants to go toward the maximum
values, and the next player

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:10.380
wants to go toward the
minimum values.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.950
But none of the static values
have been computed yet.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:16.770
So, I better start
computing them.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.226
That's the first
one I find, 2.

00:22:19.226 --> 00:22:21.840
Now, as soon as I see that 2, as
soon as the minimizer sees

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.580
that 2, the minimizer knows that
the value of this node

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.390
can't be any greater than 2.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.020
Because he'll always choose to
go down this way if this

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.390
branch produces a
bigger number.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:35.910
So, we can say that the
minimizer is assured already

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:40.580
that the score there will be
equal to or less than 2.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.580
Now, we go over and compute
the next number.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.980
There's a 7.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.850
Now, I know this is exactly
equal to 2, because he'll

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.570
never go down toward a 7.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.420
As soon as the minimizer says
equal to 2, the maximizer

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.390
says, OK, I can do equal
to or greater than 2.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.010
One, minimizer says equal
to or less than 1.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.142
Now what?

00:23:08.142 --> 00:23:12.275
Did you prepare those
2 numbers?

00:23:12.275 --> 00:23:16.360
The maximizer knows that if he
goes down here, he can't do

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.990
better than 1.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:23.510
He already knows if he goes
over here, he an get a 2.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.850
It's as if this branch
doesn't even exist.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.840
Because the maximizer would
never choose to go down there.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.160
So, you have to see that.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.330
This is the important essence
of the notion the alpha-beta

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:41.630
algorithm, which is a layering
on top of minimax that cuts

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.870
off large sections of
the search tree.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.420
So, one more time.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.620
We've developed a situation so
we know that the maximizer

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.720
gets a 2 going down to the left,
and he sees that if he

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.000
goes down to the right, he
can't do better than 1.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.420
So, he says to himself, it's
as if that branch doesn't

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.230
exist and the overall
score is 2.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.980
And it doesn't matter what
that static value is.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.350
It can be 8, as it was,
it can be plus 1,000.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:14.015
It doesn't matter.

00:24:14.015 --> 00:24:16.040
It can be minus 1,000.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.420
Or it could be plus infinity
or minus infinity.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.620
It doesn't matter, because
the maximizer will always

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.470
go the other way.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.270
So, that's the alpha-beta
algorithm.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:32.300
Can you guess why it's called
the alpha-beta algorithm?

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.210
Well, because in the algorithm
there are two parameters,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.080
alpha and beta.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.750
So, it's important to understand
that alpha-beta is

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.810
not an alternative to minimax.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.230
It's minimax with a flourish.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.610
It's something layered on top
like we layered things on top

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.605
of branch and bound to make
it more efficient.

00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:52.290
We layer stuff on top
of minimax to

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.300
make it more efficient.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.250
As you say to me, well, that's
a pretty easy example.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.700
And it is.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:59.810
So, let's try a little
bit more complex one.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.550
This is just to see if I can
do it without screwing up.

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:15.320
The reason I do one that's
complex is not just to show

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.640
how tough I am in front
of a large audience.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.450
But, rather, there's certain
points of interest that only

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.030
occur in a tree of depth
four or greater.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.010
That's the reason for
this example.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.120
But work with me and let's
see if we can work

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.670
our way through it.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:34.810
What I'm going to do is I'll
circle the numbers that we

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.790
actually have to compute.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.480
So, we actually have
to compute 8.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.430
As soon as we do that, the
minimizer knows that that node

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.450
is going to have a score of
equal to or less than 8

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.960
without looking at
anything else.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.020
Then, he looks at 7.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.516
So, that's equal to 7.

00:25:51.516 --> 00:25:54.910
Because the minimizer will
clearly go to the right.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.330
As soon as that is determined,
then the maximizer knows that

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.580
the score here is equal
to or greater than 8.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.680
Now, we evaluate the 3.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.418
The minimizer knows equal
to or less than 3.

00:26:06.418 --> 00:26:09.286
SPEAKER 4: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:09.286 --> 00:26:14.920
SPEAKER 1: Oh, sorry, the
minimizer at 7, yeah.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.930
OK, now what happens?

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.240
Well, let's see, the maximizer
gets a 7 going that way.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.180
He can't do better than 3 going
that way, so we got

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.980
another one of these
cut off situations.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.820
It's as if this branch
doesn't even exist.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.860
So, this static evaluation
need not be made.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.670
And now we know that that's not
merely equal to or greater

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.850
than 7, but exactly
equal to 7.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.530
And we can push that
number back up.

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.900
That becomes equal to
or less than 7.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.360
OK, are you with me so far?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.620
Let's get over to the other
side of the tree

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.300
as quickly as possible.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:55.410
So, there's a 9, equal to or
less than 9, 8 equal to 8,

00:26:55.410 --> 00:27:00.820
push the 8 up equal
or greater than 8.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.740
The minimizer can go down
this way and get a 7.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.020
He'll certainly never go
that way where the

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.780
maximizer can get an 8.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.706
Once again, we've
got a cut off.

00:27:13.706 --> 00:27:17.900
And if this branch didn't exist,
then that means that

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.020
these static evaluations
don't have to be made.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.150
And this value is
now exactly 7.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.340
But there's one more
thing to note here.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.510
And that is that not only do
we not have to make these

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.830
static evaluations down here,
but we don't even have to

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.040
generate these moves.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.210
So, we save two ways, both on
static evaluation and on move

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.390
generation.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:42.770
This is a real winner, this
alpha-beta thing, because it

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:44.285
saves as enormous amount
of computation.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:47.930
Well, we're on the way now.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.470
The maximizer up here is
guaranteed equal to or

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:51.220
greater than 7.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.990
Has anyone found the winning
media move yet?

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.050
Is it to the left?

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:59.240
I know that we better keep
going, because we want to

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.490
trust any oracles.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.090
So, let's see.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.780
There's a 1.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:06.700
We've calculated that.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.950
The minimizer can be guaranteed
equal to or less

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.050
than 1 at that particular
point.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.040
Think about that for a while.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.470
At the top, the maximizer
knows he can go

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.161
left and get a 7.

00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:28.610
the minimizer, if the play ever
gets here, can ensure

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.860
that he's going to drive the
situation to a board

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.240
number that's 1.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.150
So, the question is will
the maximizer ever

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:37.080
permit that to happen?

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.920
And the answer is surely not.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.090
So, over here in the development
of this side of

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.870
the tree, we're always comparing
numbers at adjacent

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.530
levels in the tree.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.780
But here's a situation where
we're comparing numbers that

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.210
are separated from each
other in the tree.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.430
And we still concluded that no
further examination of this

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.870
node makes any sense at all.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.120
This is called deep cut off.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.810
And that means that this whole
branch here might as well not

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.150
exist, and we won't have to
compute that static value.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:15.530
All right?

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.950
So, it looks--

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.250
you have this stare of
disbelief, which

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.660
is perfectly normal.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.510
I have to reconvince myself
every time that

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.915
this actually works.

00:29:24.915 --> 00:29:28.170
But when you think your way
through it, it is clear that

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.660
these computations that
I've x-ed out

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.120
don't have to be made.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.510
So, let's carry on and see if we
can complete this equal to

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:39.670
or less than 8, equal
to 8, equal to 8--

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.360
because the other branch
doesn't even exist--

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.760
equal to or less than 8.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.700
And we compare these two
numbers, do we keep going?

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.020
Yes, we keep going.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.010
Because maybe the maximizer
can go to the right and

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.870
actually get to that 8.

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:59.990
So, we have to go over here
and keep working away.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.600
There's a nine, equal
to or less than 9,

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.790
another 9 equal to 9.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.620
Push that number up equal
to or greater than 9.

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.322
The minimizer gets an
8 going this way.

00:30:14.322 --> 00:30:16.840
The maximizer is insured of
getting a 9 going that way.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.860
So, once again, we've got
a cut off situation.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.392
It's as if this doesn't exist.

00:30:21.392 --> 00:30:24.540
Those static evaluations
are not made.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.000
This move generation is not made
and computation is saved.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:36.200
So, let's see if we can do
better on this very example

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.342
using this alpha-beta idea.

00:30:38.342 --> 00:30:42.150
I'll slow it down a little bit
and change the search type to

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.110
minimax with alpha-beta.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.540
We see two numbers on each of
those nodes now, guess what

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:48.220
they're called.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.070
We already know.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:50.430
They're alpha and beta.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.270
So, what's going to happen is
the algorithm proceeds through

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.710
trees that those numbers are
going to shrink wrap

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:58.210
themselves around
the situation.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.460
So, we'll start that up.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.030
Two static evaluations
were not made.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.280
Let's try a new tree.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.496
Two different ones
were not made.

00:31:16.496 --> 00:31:25.300
A new tree, still again, two
different ones not made.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.180
Let's see what happens when we
use the classroom example, the

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:29.960
one I did up there.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.900
Let's make sure that I
didn't screw it up.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.480
I'll slow that down to 1.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.280
2, same answer.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.380
So, you probably didn't realize
it at the start.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.530
Who could?

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:56.040
In fact, the play goes down that
way, over this way, down

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.710
that way, and ultimately to
the 8, which is not the

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.390
biggest number.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.460
And it's not the smallest
number.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.866
It's the compromised number
that's arrived at virtue of

00:32:03.866 --> 00:32:07.980
the fact that this is an
adversarial situation.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:12.120
So, you say to me, how much
energy, how much work do you

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.820
actually saved by doing this?

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:34.440
Well, it is the case that in
the optimal situation, if

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.615
everything is ordered right,
if God has come down and

00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:41.110
arranged your tree in just
the right way, then the

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:44.980
approximate amount of work you
need to do, the approximate

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.340
number of static evaluations
performed, is approximately

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:54.610
equal to 2 times b
to the d over 2.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.870
We don't care about this 2.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.220
We care a whole lot
about that 2.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.760
That's the amount of
work that's done.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:06.050
It's b to the d over 2,
instead of b to d.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.000
What's that mean?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.500
Suppose that without
this idea, I can

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.080
go down seven levels.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.280
How far can I go down
with this idea?

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.940
14 levels.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.910
So, it's the difference
between a

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.340
jerk and a world champion.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.880
So, that, however, is only in
the optimal case when God has

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.710
arranged things just right.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:29.750
But in practical situations,
practical game situations, it

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:32.560
appears to be the case,
experimentally, that the

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.170
actual number is close to this
approximation for optimal

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.760
arrangements.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.462
So, you'd never not want
to use alpha-beta.

00:33:40.462 --> 00:33:43.870
It saves an amazing
amount of time.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.700
You could look at
it another way.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.990
Suppose you go down the same
number of levels, how much

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.240
less work do you have to do?

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.760
Well, quite a bit.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.050
The square root [INAUDIBLE],
right?

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.720
That's another way of looking
at how it works.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.710
So, we could go home at this
point except for one problem,

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.469
and that is that we pretended
that the branching factor is

00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.560
always the same.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.909
But, in fact, the branching
factor will vary with the game

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:21.510
state and will vary
with the game.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.989
So, you can calculate how much
computing you can do in two

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:27.223
minutes, or however much time
you have for an average move.

00:34:27.223 --> 00:34:30.520
And then you could say,
how deep can I go?

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.760
And you won't know for
sure, because it

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.210
depends on the game.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.320
So, in the earlier days of
game-playing programs, the

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.750
game-playing program left a
lot of computation on the

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.670
table, because it would make a
decision in three seconds.

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.170
And it might have made a much
different move if it used all

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.520
the competition it
had available.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:54.969
Alternatively, it might be
grinding away, and after two

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:56.880
minutes was consumed.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.410
It had no move and just
did something random.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.020
That's not very good.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.850
But that's what the early
game-playing program's did,

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:11.980
because no one knew how
deep they could go.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.910
So, let's have a look at the
situation here and say, well,

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:18.670
here's a game tree.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.290
It's a binary game tree.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.120
That's level 0.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.890
That's level 1.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.600
This is level d minus 1.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.610
And this is level d.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.050
So, down here you
have a situation

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.380
that looks like this.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.050
And I left all the game
tree out in between .

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.940
So, how many leaf nodes
are there down here?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.110
b to the d, right?

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.280
Oh, I'm going to forget about
alpha alpha-beta for a moment.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.760
As we did when we looked at
some of those optimal

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.540
searches, we're going to add
these things one at a time.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:52.550
So, forget about alpha-beta,
assume we're just doing

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.290
straight minimax.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.970
In that case, we would have to
calculate all the static

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.610
values down here
at the bottom.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.160
And there are b to d of those.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.760
How many are there at
this next level up?

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:11.720
Well, that must be b
to the d minus 1.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.650
How many fewer nodes are there
at the second to the last, the

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:19.390
penultimate level, relative
to the final level?

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:23.010
Well, 1 over b, right?

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.750
So, if I'm concerned about not
getting all the way through

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:31.070
these calculations at the d
level, I can give myself an

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.320
insurance policy by calculating
out what the

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.590
answer would be if I only went
down to the d minus 1th level.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.540
Do you get that insurance
policy?

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.510
Let's say the branching factor
is 10, how much does that

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.920
insurance policy cost me?

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.160
10% of my competition.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.690
Because I can do this
calculation and have a move in

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:59.580
hand here at level d minus 1 for
only 1/10 of the amount of

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.730
the computation that's required
to figure out what I

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.000
would do if I go all the way
down to the base level.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.460
OK, is that clear?

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.160
So this idea is extremely
important in its general form.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.600
But we haven't quite got there
yet, because what if the

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.070
branching factor turns out to be
really big and we can't get

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.130
through this level either?

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:23.860
What should we do to
make sure that we

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.215
still have a good move?

00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:27.610
SPEAKER 5: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.850
SPEAKER 1: Right, we can do
it at the b minus 2 level.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.120
So, that would be up here.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.806
And at that level, the amount
of computation would be b to

00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:42.056
the d minus 2.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:51.240
So, now we've added 10%
plus 10% of that.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:56.270
And our knee jerk is begin
to form, right?

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.180
What are we going to do in the
end to make sure that no

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.458
matter what we've got a move?

00:38:00.458 --> 00:38:02.095
CHRISTOPHER: Start from
the very first--

00:38:02.095 --> 00:38:03.280
SPEAKER 1: Correct, what's
that, Christopher?

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.250
CHRISTOPHER: Start from
the very first level?

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.515
SPEAKER 1: Start from the very
first level and give our self

00:38:06.515 --> 00:38:11.330
an insurance policy for every
level we try to calculate.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.780
But that might be real costly.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.910
So, we better figure out if this
is going to be too big of

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.220
an expense to bear.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.330
So, let's see, if we do what
Christopher suggests, then the

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:25.860
amount of computation we need
in our insurance policy is

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.460
going to be equal 1--

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:30.900
we're going to do it up here at
this level, 2, even though

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.560
we don't need it, just to make
everything work out easy.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.720
1 plus b, that's getting or
insurance policy down here at

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.600
this first level.

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.460
And we're going to add b squared
all the way down to b

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.820
to d minus 1.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.280
That's how much we're going to
spend getting an insurance

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.590
policy at every level.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:58.390
I wished that some of that high
school algebra, right?

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.812
Let's just do it for fun.

00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:04.660
Oh, unfortunate choice
of variable names.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:08.225
bs is equal to--

00:39:08.225 --> 00:39:10.165
oh, we're going to multiply
all those by b.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:29.520
Now, we'll subtract the first
one from the second one, which

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.330
tells us that the amount of
calculation needed for our

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:39.720
insurance policy is equal
to b to the d minus 1

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.070
over b minus 1.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.580
Is that a big number?

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:53.562
We could do a little algebra on
that and say that b to the

00:39:53.562 --> 00:39:54.430
d is a huge number.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.240
So, that minus one
doesn't count.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.620
And B is probably 10 to 15.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.830
So, b minus 1 is, essentially,
equal to b.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:08.441
So, that's approximately equal
b to the d minus 1.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.340
So, with an approximation
factored in, the amount of

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.140
computation needed to do
insurance policies at every

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.870
level is not much different from
the amount of computation

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.770
needed to get an insurance
policy at just one level, the

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:24.910
penultimate one.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.550
So, this idea is called
progressive deepening.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.610
And now we can visit our gold
star idea list and see how

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.170
these things match
up with that.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:50.050
First of all, the dead horse
principle comes to the fore

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.530
when we talk about alpha-beta.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.570
Because we know with alpha-beta
that we can get rid

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.705
of a whole lot of the tree and
not do static evaluation, not

00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:59.000
even do move generation.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.120
That's the dead horse we
don't want to beat.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.530
There's no point in doing that
calculation, because it can't

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.250
figure into the answer.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:12.830
The development of the
progressive deepening idea, I

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.860
like to think of in terms of
the martial arts principle,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.600
we're using the enemy's
characteristics against them.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.690
Because of this exponential
blow-up, we have exactly the

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.610
right characteristics to have
a move available at every

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.260
level as an insurance policy
against not getting through to

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.360
the next level.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.910
And, finally, this whole idea
of progressive deepening can

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.440
be viewed as a prime example
of what we like to call

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.670
anytime algorithms that always
have an answer ready to go as

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.690
soon as an answer is demanded.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.400
So, as soon as that clock runs
out at two minutes, some

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.250
answer is available.

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:47.460
It'll be the best one that the
system can compute in the time

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.480
available given the
characteristics of the game

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.930
tree as it's developed so far.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.780
So, there are other kinds
of anytime algorithms.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.500
This is an example of one.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.500
That's how all game playing
programs work, minimax, plus

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.290
alpha-beta, plus progressive
deepening.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:08.670
Christopher, is alpha-beta
a alternative to minimax?

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.450
CHRISTOPHER: No.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.072
SPEAKER 1: No, it's not.

00:42:11.072 --> 00:42:13.100
It's something you layer
on top of minimax.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.980
Does alpha-beta give you a
different answer from minimax?

00:42:18.655 --> 00:42:20.920
CHRISTOPHER: No.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.600
No, it doesn't.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.105
SPEAKER 1: Let's see everybody
shake their head

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:24.590
one way or the other.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.960
It does not give you an answer
different from minimax.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.770
That's right.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.430
It gives you exactly
the same answer,

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.660
not a different answer.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.800
It's a speed-up.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.570
It's not an approximation.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.140
It's a speed-up.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.835
It cuts off lots of the tree.

00:42:36.835 --> 00:42:39.260
It's a dead horse principle
at work.

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.618
You got a question,
Christopher?

00:42:40.618 --> 00:42:45.558
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, since all
of the lines progressively

00:42:45.558 --> 00:42:50.498
[INAUDIBLE], is it possible to
keep a temporary value if the

00:42:50.498 --> 00:42:54.944
value [INAUDIBLE] each node of
the tree and then [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:54.944 --> 00:42:56.920
SPEAKER 1: Oh, excellent
suggestion.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.930
In fact, Christopher
has just--

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:01.510
I think, if I can jump ahead
a couple steps--

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.600
Christopher has reinvented
a very important idea.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.295
Progressive deepening not only
ensures you have an answer at

00:43:14.295 --> 00:43:18.080
any time, it actually improves
the performance of alpha-beta

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.090
when you layer alpha-beta
on top of it.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.050
Because these values that are
calculated at intermediate

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:28.890
parts of the tree are used to
reorder the nodes under the

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:33.190
tree so as to give you maximum
alpha-beta cut-off.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.650
I think that's what you
said, Christopher.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:39.380
But if it isn't, we'll talk
about your idea after class.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.170
So, this is what every game
playing program does.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.510
How is Deep Blue different?

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:45.760
Not much.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:57.000
So, Deep Blue, as of 1997, did
about 200 million static

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.042
evaluations per second.

00:43:59.042 --> 00:44:03.530
And it went down, using
alpha-beta,

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.100
about 14, 15, 16 levels.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:21.800
So, Deep Blue was minimax,
plus alpha-beta, plus

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:27.480
progressive deepening, plus
a whole lot of parallel

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:42.080
computing, plus an opening book,
plus special purpose

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:47.800
stuff for the end game, plus--

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.470
perhaps the most important
thing--

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.150
uneven tree development.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.880
So far, we've pretended that the
tree always goes up in an

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.610
even way to a fixed level.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.310
But there's no particular reason
why that has to be so.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.870
Some situation down at the
bottom of the tree may be

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.920
particularly dynamic.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.720
In the very next move, you might
be able to capture the

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.780
opponent's Queen.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.750
So, in circumstances like that,
you want to blow out a

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.600
little extra search.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.280
So, eventually, you get to
the idea that there's no

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.810
particular reason to
have the search go

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.880
down to a fixed level.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.920
But, instead, you can develop
the tree in a way that gives

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.800
you the most confidence
that your

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.330
backed-up numbers are correct.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:46.670
That's the most important of
these extra flourishes added

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:51.370
by Deep Blue when it beat
Kasparov in 1997.

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:53.890
And now we can come back
and say, well, you

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:54.710
understand Deep Blue.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.430
But is this a model of
anything that goes

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.950
on in our own heads?

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:02.010
Is this a model of any kind
of human intelligence?

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:05.210
Or is it a different kind
of intelligence?

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:06.460
And the answer is
mixed, right?

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.950
Because we are often in
situations where we are

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:11.720
playing a game.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.470
We're competing with another
manufacturer.

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.300
We have to think what the other
manufacturer will do in

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.500
response to what we do
down several levels.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.230
On the other hand, is going
down 14 levels what human

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:29.705
chess players do when they win
the world championship?

00:46:29.705 --> 00:46:33.620
It doesn't seem, even to them,
like that's even a remote

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.570
possibility.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.740
They have to do something
different, because they don't

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:41.180
have that kind of computational
horsepower.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:45.350
This is doing computation in the
same way that a bulldozer

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:47.600
processes gravel.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.650
It's substituting raw power
for sophistication.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:54.790
So, when a human chess master
plays the game, they have a

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.640
great deal of chess knowledge
in their head and they

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.730
recognize patterns.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.910
There are famous experiments,
by the way, that demonstrate

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.730
this in the following way.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:08.250
Show a chessboard to a chess
master and ask them to

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:10.130
memorize it.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.950
They're very good at that, as
long as it's a legitimate

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:14.180
chessboard.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.510
If the pieces are placed
randomly, they're no

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.380
good at it at all.

00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:21.502
So, it's very clear that they've
developed a repertoire

00:47:21.502 --> 00:47:24.550
of chess knowledge that makes
it possible for them to

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:28.150
recognize situations and play
the game much more like number

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.940
1 up there.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.150
So, Deep Blue is manifesting
some kind of intelligence.

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.360
But it's not our intelligence.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.800
It's bulldozer intelligence.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.330
So, it's important to understand
that kind of

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.020
intelligence, too.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.290
But it's not necessarily the
same kind of intelligence that

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:43.540
we have in our own head.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.570
So, that concludes what we're
going to do today.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.790
And, as you know, on Wednesday
we have a celebration of

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:56.940
learning, which is familiar to
you if you take a 309.1.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.440
And, therefore, I will
see you on Wednesday,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:01.690
all of you, I imagine.
