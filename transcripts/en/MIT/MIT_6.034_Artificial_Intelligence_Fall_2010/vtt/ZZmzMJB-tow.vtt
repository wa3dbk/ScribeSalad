00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:25.090
PROFESSOR: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.820
Today, we're going to
talk about boosting.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.900
Boosting is pretty awesome,
and it's not as hard

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.630
as it might seem.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.050
It's actually pretty easy,
as long as you do it right.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.610
So let's take a look at
this boosting problem.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.680
Just like with ID
trees, you may have

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.950
noticed there's the ID tree
problem where there's a graph,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.200
and all of the tests are x and
y-axis tests on that graph.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.150
And then there's
the ID tree problem

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.950
where there are a lot of
crazy different classifiers

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.480
about characteristics
that are discrete.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.530
And then all of the sort of
ID tree stumps, if you will,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.730
are built out of those
discrete qualities.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.300
This is an example
of a boosting problem

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.510
of the second type with a
bunch of discrete qualities,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.040
like evil, emo,
transforms, sparkly.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.820
And it has an numerical quality
number of romantic interests.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.680
So it's one of
basically the two kinds

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.346
of boosting problems
that you might see.

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:32.850
And now, there is the
two-axis Cartesian problem.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.990
A good example of
that is the hours

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.290
of sleep versus coffee problem,
which I, for one, am planning

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.980
on doing in tutorial on Monday
so that you guys sort of get

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.390
a sense of both
types of problems.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.990
This one looks big.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.190
I think it looks-- I mean,
it has ten different vampires

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.880
or non-vampires to classify.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.920
It has a whole bunch of
possible classifiers.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.340
But if you do it right,
you can do it fast.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.290
So here's the prompt
for the problem.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.550
Let's see.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.840
After graduating
MIT, you get a job

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.620
working for Van
Helsing and Sommers,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.160
a famous vampire-hunting
consulting agency.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.080
Gabriel Van Helsing,
one of the two founders,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.511
once attended several
6.034 lectures as a guest,

00:02:20.511 --> 00:02:22.010
and he remembers
Professor Winston's

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.262
vampire identification
tree lecture.

00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:25.720
He assigns you the
task of creating

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.700
a superior classifier
for vampires

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.740
by using boosting on
the following data.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.650
So we've got the
ID number, which

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.170
we can use to just write
things out in shorthand.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.980
We've got the name of several
vampires and non-vampires.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.502
Then you see whether
they're a vampire or not.

00:02:43.502 --> 00:02:44.960
That's whether
their classification

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.590
is a plus or minus for
the quality of vampire.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.260
After that, there's a
bunch of possible ways

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170
to classify whether
they're a vampire or not.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.800
There's whether or not
they're evil, whether or not

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.740
they're emo, whether
or not they transform,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.540
and whether or not
they're sparkly, as well

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.260
as the number of romantic
interests that they have.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.080
So for instance,
on the one hand,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.160
you have Dracula, who's
evil, but he's not emo.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.250
He can transform into a
bat or a cloud of mist.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.390
He does not sparkle, and he
has five romantic interests--

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.300
those three vampire chicks
at the beginning, Wilhelmina

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.200
Murray, and Lucy Westenra.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.300
So on the other hand,
you have Squall Leonhart,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.510
who's the protagonist of Final
Fantasy VII, is extremely emo

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.350
and doesn't have any of
the other characteristics.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.790
And he's not a vampire.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.280
However, he's a
nice counterexample

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.750
for a possible rule
that all emo people

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.875
are vampires because
he's very, very emo,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.390
and he's not a vampire.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.852
So how will we go about tackling
this problem with boosting?

00:03:54.852 --> 00:03:57.060
Well, there's a whole bunch
of different classifiers.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.520
And if you think
this is all of them--

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.640
like evil, emo,
transforms, sparkly.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.510
romantics interests, and
true-- it's actually only half

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.380
of them.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.810
The other half are
the opposite versions,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.060
but we'll ignore them for now.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.280
So if you look at
these, you can probably

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.630
figure out what they
mean-- evil equals

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.810
yes means vampire is
what we're saying here--

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.990
except maybe true.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.730
You might be saying, why is
there one that just says true?

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.500
The one that just says true says
that everybody is a vampire.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.880
You might think, oh, that sucks.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.250
But it's not that bad since
seven of the 10 samples

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.530
are vampires.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.690
The key, crucial
thing about boosting

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.520
is that for any
possible classifier,

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.000
like classifying on the evil
dimension-- which actually

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.650
sounds like some
kind of weird place

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.899
that you'd go in a comic book.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:51.690
But classifying on the
emo dimension or whatever,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.970
as long as it's not a
50-50 split of the data,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.990
you're guaranteed
to be able to use it

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.630
in some way for boosting.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.220
If there is a 50-50 split,
it's like flipping a coin,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.670
so it's useless.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.490
Because if you had
some other thing,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.210
like gender equals
male or female--

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.580
and let's say that was 50-50.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.700
It's not.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.450
But let's say it was
50-50 between vampire

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.390
and non-vampire-- it's
a useless classifier

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.495
because it would be just
the same as flipping a coin.

00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:26.690
You'd get no information.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.210
Now, you might
say, wait a minute.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.960
What about classifiers
that get worse than 50-50?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.470
What about them?

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.430
Might not they be even worse
than a 50-50 classifier?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.325
I claim a classifier
that gets less than 50-50

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:41.760
is still better than
a classifier that

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.242
gets exactly a 50-50 split.

00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:45.113
Is there a question?

00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:45.738
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:49.224
In the ID tree example, somebody
said you used 50-50 classifiers

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.714
and played around.

00:05:51.714 --> 00:05:54.536
And after you already
produced the elements per set,

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:57.190
then you only used 50-50
classifiers [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.690
per set.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.350
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, in the ID tree example,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.900
you might use 50-50
classifiers in later rounds

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.670
if, for instance, there's
a 50-50 classifier

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.420
except for that most of
the things off of that side

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.410
have been already removed.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.750
Let's say there's
20 data points,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.750
and there's a classifier
that splits it 10 and 10.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.650
And it gets half plus
half minus on both sides.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.209
But all the pluses
from the right side

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:29.000
have been removed by
some other classifier.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.708
You might use it.

00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:30.360
That's true.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.235
But in boosting, you
will never use something

00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:34.410
that's a 50-50 classifier.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.970
You never use something that
has exactly a 50-50 chance

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.690
of being correct.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.620
Because if it has a 50-50 chance
of being correct, it's useless.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.080
And if it has a 50-50
chance of-- no, sorry.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.630
Let me specify again.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.945
You'll never use
something that has

00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:03.480
a 50-50 chance of giving you the
right answer given the weights.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.870
That's very, very important.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.940
And that may be what your
question was getting at.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.070
As I'm about to show you
and as Patrick told you

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.910
in the lecture, in later
rounds of boosting,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.430
you change the weights of
each of the 10 data points.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.120
At first, you start with
all weights being 1/10.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.680
The weights have add up to 1.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.580
In this case, you
never, ever choose

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.640
a classifier that gets five
of them right and five of them

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.540
wrong.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.530
In the later rounds,
you'll never, ever

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.750
choose a classifier that
gets half of the weight

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.430
wrong-- exactly half
of the weight wrong.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.590
But half of the weight may not
be half of the data points.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.740
So it's possible to
choose a classifier that

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.130
gets half of the data
points wrong if it doesn't

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.630
get half of the weight wrong.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.920
And that's similar to an
ID tree when you've already

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.330
gotten things right before.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.371
Because you'll see that
the weight is going to go

00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:58.730
to the ones you got wrong.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.760
So I'm not saying that
you should throw out

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.400
right away anything that gets
five of the points wrong.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.900
Hell, you shouldn't even throw
out right away something that

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.191
gets seven of the points wrong.

00:08:08.191 --> 00:08:11.390
It's possible-- possible-- that
you can get seven of the points

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.590
wrong, or getting less
than half of the weight

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.980
wrong if those other three
points are really, really

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.050
annoying to get right.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.930
And we'll see that later on.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.660
But for insight, at
every step along the way,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.620
we're willing to choose
any classifier that

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.380
doesn't get 50-50.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.590
However, we want to choose
the classifier that gets

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.010
the most of the weight right.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.610
By most of the
weight, at first, we

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.030
mean most of the points right.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.810
Later, we will mean exactly what
I said-- most of the weight.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.110
And if you don't understand
that, it's sometimes

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.304
hard to get it right
away when Patrick just

00:08:51.304 --> 00:08:53.220
lectures through it,
introduces a new concept.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.719
If you don't
understand that, you'll

00:08:54.719 --> 00:08:58.040
see what I mean when we
go through, all right?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.100
So my point I was making
before is, what about things

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.007
that get less than half
of the weight right?

00:09:04.007 --> 00:09:06.340
Well, those are always OK
because you can just flip them

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.900
around, use their inverse,
and that gets more than half

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.010
of the weight right.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.570
It's sort of like--
yeah, it's sort

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.270
of like my girlfriend
always tells me

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.790
that she is more than 50% likely
to choose the wrong direction

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.740
when you're trying to go
between two places, which

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.920
I'm kind of skeptical of.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.910
But I said, if
that's really true,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.200
then we can just go wherever
you didn't say to go,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.280
and we'll be more likely
to go the right way.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.909
So you're actually really
good at finding the place

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.700
that we want to go.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.950
And then she's like,
no, that won't work.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.270
Because then I'll know that
you're going to do that,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.115
and I'll double
say the wrong way.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:44.740
And then you'll go
the wrong way again.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.670
But that not withstanding,
you can see you

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.250
can apply the same
concept to boosting.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.270
And that's why
underneath of this,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.450
I have all the opposite
versions of all these tests.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.520
So what should we be doing
to solve this problem more

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.270
quickly?

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.900
First, let's figure out which
data points are misclassified

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.980
by each of these classifiers.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.460
In other words, if we say all
the evil things are vampires

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.250
and all the non-evil
things are not vampires,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.850
what do we get wrong?

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.740
And if we do that
for every classifier,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.830
then that'll make
it faster later on.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.630
Because later on, we're going
to go through classifiers,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.450
and we're going to have to add
up the ones they got wrong.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.670
So this chart over here is
going to be extremely useful.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.420
And on the test that
this appeared in,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.020
they even made you fill it
in to help yourself out.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.440
So let's see.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.560
If we said that all the
evil equals yes are vampires

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.130
and all the evil equals
no are not vampires,

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.400
then-- I'll do the
first one for you.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.940
So we get all of
the non-vampires

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.390
correct because they
are all evil equals no.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:59.770
But unfortunately, we get Angel,
Edward Cullen, Saya Otonashi,

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:06.880
and Lestat de Lioncourt wrong
because they are vampires,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.275
and they're evil equals no.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.840
Apparently, Lestat is iffy.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.530
But I never read those books,
and the Wikipedia article

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.540
said that in the end,
he wasn't that evil.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.310
So there we go.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.060
Evil equals yes
misclassifies 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.310
All right, so let's
try emo equals yes.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.950
I'll have someone else do it.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.750
So let's see if you guys got it.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.485
So if we say that all the
emo people are vampires

00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:37.930
and all the non-emo
people are not vampires,

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.175
what do we get wrong?

00:11:39.175 --> 00:11:40.360
AUDIENCE: 1, 6, 7, 9.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.810
PROFESSOR: 1, 6, 7, 9-- that's
exactly right, and fast.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.350
Good.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.230
We get 1, 6, 7, and 9 wrong.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.365
1, 6, and 7 are wrong
because they are not emo,

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:50.240
but they're vampires.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.065
9 is wrong because Squall is
emo, and he is not a vampire.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:57.040
Good.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.150
OK, what if we said that exactly
the transforming characters are

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:05.502
vampires and the ones that do
not transform are not vampires?

00:12:05.502 --> 00:12:06.710
Which ones will we get wrong?

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.670
PROFESSOR: Transforms
is the next one over.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.662
AUDIENCE: All of the
ones [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:19.408
PROFESSOR: So
which ones would we

00:12:19.408 --> 00:12:21.866
get wrong if we said that said
transforms yes were vampires

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.642
and transforms no
were not vampires?

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:25.620
AUDIENCE: We'd get 8 wrong.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.036
PROFESSOR: We'd
definitely 8 wrong

00:12:27.036 --> 00:12:30.008
because she's not a vampire.

00:12:30.008 --> 00:12:30.924
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.170
PROFESSOR: Well, no.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.582
It's actually on there.

00:12:37.582 --> 00:12:43.095
AUDIENCE: And 3 and 4
we'd also get wrong.

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:43.720
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.710
AUDIENCE: As well as 5.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.710
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.230
OK.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.700
Oh, man.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.741
You didn't see the chart.

00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:50.580
You were just like, hmmm.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.470
You saw the left.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.033
You just said, hm,
which one of these

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:53.850
are the transforming characters?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.320
OK, that's pretty hardcore.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.195
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER].

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.140
PROFESSOR: But yeah,
3, 4, 5, and 8.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.780
No, no, it's definitely
given to you.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.210
That would be like
the worst test

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.920
ever for international students.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.320
Ah, if you don't know these
ten characters as vampires,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.270
you lose.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.390
All right, so what
about that sparkly

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.160
equals yes is a vampire,
and if it's not sparkly,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.634
it's not a vampire?

00:13:20.634 --> 00:13:22.050
This is guaranteed
not to go well.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.875
What do you think it's
going to get wrong?

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.330
AUDIENCE: For sparkly?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.039
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sparkly equals
yes are the only vampires.

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:30.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] wrong.

00:13:30.205 --> 00:13:34.133
Angel's going to be wrong.

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:43.709
Saya-- so 1, 2,
4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.250
PROFESSOR: And 8--
yes, that's right.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.950
It gets 1, 2, 4, 5,
6, 7, and 8 wrong.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.980
That's pretty awful.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.760
But dammit, it gets
Edward Cullen right.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.230
And he's hard to get
correct due to the fact

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.860
that he's not very
much like a vampire.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.100
He's more of a superhero
who says he's a vampire.

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.620
OK, so next, number of romantic
interest greater than two.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.580
So if they have more than
two romantic interest,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.510
they're a vampire.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.520
And otherwise,
they're not a vampire.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.352
So which ones would
that get wrong?

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:15.852
Hm?

00:14:15.852 --> 00:14:16.643
AUDIENCE: 3 and 10.

00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:18.740
PROFESSOR: Just 3
and 10, that's right.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.850
Because Circe had Odysseus.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.360
She had Telemachus.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.360
Actually, she had that guy
she turned into a woodpecker.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.510
She had that other guy
who was a sea god who

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.800
caused her to turn Scylla
into the nine-headed thing,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.130
and probably at least
one other person.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.770
So Circe it gets wrong.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.530
And it also gets Edward Cullen
wrong because he only has one.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.240
So 3 and 10.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.150
You can tell I thought
about this problem

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.430
when I was writing it up.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.580
I wrote this one.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.400
All right, number of romantic
interest greater than four.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.460
So it's a little bit
different this time.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.482
Now you have to have at least
four romantic interests--

00:14:58.482 --> 00:15:00.190
or actually, greater
than four, but there

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.100
are none that are exactly four--
to be classified as a vampire.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.100
Which ones do you think
it's going to get wrong?

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.460
AUDIENCE: 3, 4, 10.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:16.510
PROFESSOR: Yup, it is going
to get 3, 4, and 10 wrong.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.330
Because now, you
run into the fact

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:27.250
that Saya has that blond
[INAUDIBLE] guy, Haji, and Kai.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:31.874
So the last of the positive
ones-- because I claim I

00:15:31.874 --> 00:15:34.040
can derive all the negative
ones if you guys give me

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.220
the positive ones.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.511
The last of the positive ones
is everybody's a vampire.

00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:39.393
Who does that get wrong?

00:15:39.393 --> 00:15:40.836
AUDIENCE: 8, 9, 10.

00:15:40.836 --> 00:15:42.625
PROFESSOR: Yes, OK.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.450
Now, I can derive
all the negative ones

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.750
from this without a sweat.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:16:00.462
Evil equals no-- well,
it's 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:16:00.462 --> 00:16:01.670
without looking at the chart.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.680
Raise your hand if you see
why it's 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.390
without looking at the chart.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.780
Raise your hand if you don't.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.910
Nobody, OK-- wait.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:16.920
One hand.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.730
OK, I saw another one
back there too later.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:19.980
They were just more tentative.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.410
OK, it's the complement
of A because A is

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.200
evil equals yes is a vampire.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.690
It gets 2, 3, 4, and 5 wrong.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.470
So therefore, evil equals no
is a vampire is guaranteed

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.810
to get all the opposite ones.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.630
AUDIENCE: Oh, we could
have looked at that too?

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
we're looking here,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:35.370
but we're not looking
at the big chart there.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:36.190
AUDIENCE: You can look at any?

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:36.710
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.460
If you can't look at
anything, then you're

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.250
screwed-- unless not only are
you as hardcore as this guy,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.700
but you've also
memorized the numbers.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:56.470
All right, so emo equals no is
going to be 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:03.450
Transforms equals no
is 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:11.490
Sparkle equals no is 3, 9, 10.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.440
Romantic interest less than two
is everything except 3 and 10--

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.805
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:27.140
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:34.754
And then finally, everything but
8, 9, and 10, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:36.240
6, 7.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.860
All right, so when
we started off,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.370
we know what
everything gets wrong.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.740
I then make a bold
claim, because there

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.560
are n of these, which is 14.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.700
I make the claim that
there are only six

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.370
that, in your wildest dreams,
you would ever possibly

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.820
even consider using ever.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.071
And the rest, you
would never, ever use.

00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:56.570
Question?

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.861
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just have
a question about the number

00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.913
of romantic interests.

00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:00.538
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.018
AUDIENCE: You negated it without
an equals on either side.

00:18:03.018 --> 00:18:04.010
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.884
That works only because
there are [INAUDIBLE] 2 or 4.

00:18:06.884 --> 00:18:09.300
But it should have been negated
with a less than or equal.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.250
I'm copying off of the quiz.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.780
But yes.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.334
I noticed that this morning
when I was putting myself

00:18:15.334 --> 00:18:16.000
through my pace.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.530
I'm like, there's not a
less than or equal to.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.113
Wait a minute.

00:18:18.113 --> 00:18:19.750
And then, oh, wait.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.429
It doesn't have any 2's or 4's.

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:23.220
Actually, I don't
remember writing them all

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.280
as 5's and 3's.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.690
It's possible that somebody
else in the post-editing process

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.410
changed them all to be
about the same number,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.960
and then changed the
less than or equal tos

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.840
to be less confusing.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.410
It's possible I had Circe
at 4, and there was an equal

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.270
to somewhere.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.980
And they were like, forget it.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.146
Because I can't think of
the fifth romantic interest

00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:42.390
for her.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.820
So yes, normally, you
would have to negate it

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.700
with an equal to sign,
but there happened

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.750
to not be any things that
are equal to 4 or 2 here.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:53.640
So they get away
with it this time.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.819
But it's good practice.

00:18:56.819 --> 00:18:58.610
So I'm claiming that
in our wildest dreams,

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.800
we'd only ever want to
use six of these ever.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.190
And the other eight, forget it.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.860
So let's see.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.445
I will call on people at random
to-- the first people obviously

00:19:11.445 --> 00:19:13.620
are getting it really
easy-- to tell me

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.610
which of these you think that
you might ever want to use.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.733
Give me one you might
ever want to use.

00:19:18.733 --> 00:19:19.680
AUDIENCE: E.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.490
PROFESSOR: Why, E?

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.310
Of course.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.740
That's the best one.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.180
Yes, that's one that you
might ever want to use.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.780
I'll circle the ones that
you might ever want to use.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.840
E-- it only gets 3 and 10 wrong.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.920
That's amazing.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.220
It's like the best
class of [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.934
OK, so give me another one
that you might ever want to us.

00:19:37.934 --> 00:19:38.433
AUDIENCE: F.

00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:40.620
PROFESSOR: F. Let's see.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.930
F-- F is great.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.820
It only gets three wrong.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.180
Do people agree that you
would ever want to use F?

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.810
AUDIENCE: No.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.143
PROFESSOR: Everyone's saying no.

00:19:48.143 --> 00:19:50.165
Why not?

00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:51.990
AUDIENCE: It's like
E, except worse.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:54.000
PROFESSOR: It's like
E, except worse.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.500
It's guaranteed at
every step, no matter

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.900
what the weights are, to
have a worse accuracy than E.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.940
It is definitely good.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.530
If E wasn't around, it would
be one of our best classifiers

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.580
of all.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.830
But actually, F is
not one of the six.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.670
This is why I had them write on
the test that there were six,

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.870
because people might
not have found all six.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.130
Because people who did
figure out not to include F

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.380
might not have figured out
to include some of the ones

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:19.470
you want to include.

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.030
So--

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.071
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
why you can't use F.

00:20:22.071 --> 00:20:23.690
PROFESSOR: Why you
can't use F, OK.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:28.200
So we start off with 1/10
weight for all our data points.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.190
But let's say during
our time of boosting

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.470
that all ten of the data points
have now different weights.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.300
So we'll call whatever
the weight of 3

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.510
is, which you're going
to get wrong-- you want

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.200
to minimize the error, right?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.080
So that weight of 3, which goes
into the error of the E, is x.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.600
The weight of 10 can be y.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.954
So if you're thinking
of choosing 3,

00:20:47.954 --> 00:20:49.120
you know you're-- oh, sorry.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.035
If you're thinking of choosing
E, your error is x plus y.

00:20:52.035 --> 00:20:52.660
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.493
PROFESSOR: If you're
thinking of choosing F,

00:20:54.493 --> 00:20:57.920
your error is x plus y plus
z, where z is the error of 4.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.280
And since you're never going
to have a negative weight,

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.462
x plus y plus z is always
greater than x plus y.

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:03.962
AUDIENCE: You can't
choose something

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:06.503
without the 3 and the 10 anymore
because you already chose E.

00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:10.417
PROFESSOR: That's-- yes, you
would probably choose something

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:12.250
that didn't get the
three and the ten wrong.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.340
But you would certainly
never choose F ever

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.600
because it's always worse than
E. In fact, this is exactly

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.600
the process that will allow
you to find the correct six.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.930
And by "will," I mean "can."

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.210
And by "can," I mean, let's
see if you guys get it.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:28.580
Give me another one of the
six that you might keep.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.590
AUDIENCE: K.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.520
PROFESSOR: K is the
claim-- sparkly.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.560
K, I'm going to say will
lose for the same reason

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.120
as F. It's 3, 9, and 10.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.970
It's essentially
similar to 3, 4, and 10.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.620
So-- oh, by the
way, we should not

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:50.380
be only going for the ones
with the fewest incorrect.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.630
You need to be going for ones
that do not have something

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.030
that is strictly better.

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.070
In this case, 3 and
10 wrong is strictly

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.491
better than getting
3, 9, and 10 wrong.

00:21:59.491 --> 00:21:59.990
Question?

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:02.230
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was
going to say transform.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.021
PROFESSOR: You were
going to say transform.

00:22:04.021 --> 00:22:06.460
You are going to be correct.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.775
Transforms is one of the
ones we need, C. 3, 4, 5

00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:13.280
and 8-- there's nothing
down here that gets fewer

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.720
than those wrong.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.120
There's nothing that gets us
3, 4, 5 wrong, for instance.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.950
Yeah, there's no way to get 3,
4 wrong without getting either

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.028
10 wrong, or 5 and 8 wrong.

00:22:28.028 --> 00:22:30.594
AUDIENCE: So why
is the 8 like that?

00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:31.260
PROFESSOR: What?

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.410
AUDIENCE: Why not G?

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.030
PROFESSOR: Why not G?

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:34.931
Why not?

00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:35.430
Why not G?

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.078
Let's include G, too.

00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:38.619
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:40.070
We don't have to do it all?

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.261
PROFESSOR: We need six.

00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:43.260
No, I just said give me
any, and someone gave me

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.310
the easiest one, E. Question?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.995
AUDIENCE: B

00:22:45.995 --> 00:22:46.870
PROFESSOR: Why not B?

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:47.920
B looks great.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.674
I love B. Let's include
B. Does someone else want

00:22:52.674 --> 00:22:54.590
to give another one that
they want to include?

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.650
AUDIENCE: A.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.321
PROFESSOR: A. Why not A?

00:22:57.321 --> 00:22:57.820
Sure.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.360
I mean, it's hard
to see down here

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.610
because there might be
something better on the bottom.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.600
But yeah, there's not.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.090
So let's include A. Why not A?

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.370
I love A. A's great.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.280
OK.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:18.330
So that is now five.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.500
There's one more that we need.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:25.360
It's by far the
hardest one to find.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.880
Find me one more that there's
nothing better than it.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.810
There's nothing that
has a strict subset

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.270
of the same ones wrong.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.090
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:34.520
PROFESSOR: What?

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.934
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
can we quickly--

00:23:35.934 --> 00:23:38.711
why would you choose
A before we chose C?

00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:40.252
PROFESSOR: OK, why
would you choose A

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.580
before you've chosen C?

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.490
Let's say 8 was a
real problem for you.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.970
And you were just getting--
let's say that 3, 4 and 5,

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.324
they weren't that bad.

00:23:49.324 --> 00:23:50.240
They weren't that bad.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.750
They weren't that bad.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:52.680
OK, you got them wrong
here with transforms.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:58.600
You chose C. But sometime later,
8 was just by far your issue.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.770
All right?

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.441
3, 4, and 5, and 8-- 3, 4 and
5 are much smaller weights

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:03.940
than 8.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.790
And then after you've got 3,
4, 5, and 8 wrong, 3, 4, and 5

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.840
were still not that bad.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.200
And 8 still was a high number.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.640
And then sometime later down the
line, you're looking at things.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.092
And you're saying,
you know what?

00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:17.800
I really don't want
to get 8 wrong again,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.689
but I don't mind if I
get 3, 4 and 5 wrong.

00:24:19.689 --> 00:24:21.230
Maybe I'll get it
wrong with 2, which

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.664
I've never gone wrong yet.

00:24:22.664 --> 00:24:25.080
Actually, none of the ones
we've circled here get 2 wrong,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.950
so it's probably not
that bad to get 2 wrong.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.540
So that's why-- because
it doesn't get 8 wrong.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:35.405
If A was 2, 3, 4, 5,
8, you'd never take it.

00:24:35.405 --> 00:24:36.445
Do you see what I mean?

00:24:36.445 --> 00:24:37.820
Oh, did someone
raise their hand?

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:38.920
Did someone find it?

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.378
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:24:40.378 --> 00:24:43.780
You can use the same reasoning
for choosing K, right?

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.668
Because after E, we
could have chosen A

00:24:47.668 --> 00:24:51.080
and said that 9 only
a little different--

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.770
PROFESSOR: But it's
strictly worse.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:59.348
AUDIENCE: Sorry, sorry, I meant
[INAUDIBLE] E to 9 and 10,

00:24:59.348 --> 00:25:02.327
and then we could have
chosen 3, 9, and 10, right?

00:25:02.327 --> 00:25:02.827
Because--

00:25:02.827 --> 00:25:07.051
PROFESSOR: But we chose to
use E. Because getting only 3,

00:25:07.051 --> 00:25:08.800
10 wrong is better
than getting 3, 9,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:10.782
and 10 wrong in any universe.

00:25:10.782 --> 00:25:12.310
You pick.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.760
You see what I mean?

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.940
It might not be that much worse.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.980
It might be only a little
bit worse to choose K,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.170
but it's always worse.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.118
So it-- question?

00:25:22.118 --> 00:25:25.106
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the right
one by reasoning [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:25.106 --> 00:25:28.094
we need one that
doesn't have 3 in it.

00:25:28.094 --> 00:25:32.576
Because right now,
[INAUDIBLE] get 3 wrong.

00:25:32.576 --> 00:25:34.700
PROFESSOR: OK, that's
a pretty good insight.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.349
What are you thinking about?

00:25:36.349 --> 00:25:38.217
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
trying to justify D.

00:25:38.217 --> 00:25:39.800
PROFESSOR: You're
trying to justify D.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.199
PROFESSOR: D is huge.

00:25:42.199 --> 00:25:43.740
It gets more than
half of them wrong.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.670
But you know what?

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.600
It gets 3 right.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.530
You know what?

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.930
It gets 10 right.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.570
And unlike our things that get
3 and 10 right, which is B,

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.660
it also gets 9 right.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.450
D is the last classifier.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.530
You got it.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.250
It's hard to choose one that
has seven of them wrong,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:04.620
but D is the last
one you might pick.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.695
It turns out there's
nothing better than this

00:26:06.695 --> 00:26:12.120
for classifying correctly those
annoying data points of Edward

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.730
Cullen and Squall, and also
Circe, who's not that annoying,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.210
but she tends to be a problem
when romance is concerned.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.240
So these are the six
that we might use.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.720
We can now ignore
the rest of them

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.452
forever-- or at least until
someone reuses this problem

00:26:29.452 --> 00:26:30.410
or something like that.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.762
But we can ignore everything
except A, B, C, D, E,

00:26:32.762 --> 00:26:34.470
G. In fact, why did
I even bring that up?

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.300
All the ones we want
are on the front.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.020
I'll bring it back down.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.270
Then I'll cross this off
with reckless abandon.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.979
That even broke off
a piece of my chalk.

00:26:43.979 --> 00:26:45.770
Now, these are the ones
that we're actually

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.110
thinking about using.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.810
There is a chart
over here already

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:55.590
prepared to do some boosting
with these six classifiers,

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.020
all right?

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.710
So let's give it a try.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.270
Now, remember, in
boosting, we always

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.790
try to choose whichever
classifier has the least

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.150
errors.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:03.720
Is there a question?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.636
AUDIENCE: Sorry, yeah.

00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:07.450
Before we move on, can
you say again a little

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.610
more slowly what
exactly we were looking

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.225
for when we were
choosing our classifiers,

00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:14.310
like something about the subset?

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.320
PROFESSOR: You generally
want to take classifiers.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.220
So I'll tell you what let's
you cross off a classifier.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.210
That may be a
better way to do it.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:31.400
You can cross off a classifier
as useless if-- and by the way,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.100
this is only useful if
you can do it faster

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.880
than just wasting your time
looking at all of them.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.492
Because if you can't cross
off some of them as useless--

00:27:39.492 --> 00:27:41.200
usually on the test,
they won't make you.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.790
You can just waste
your time and have

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:46.380
14 instead of six possibilities
every step of the boosting.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.530
But take a look at this--
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:52.260
Then see.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.660
Do you have anything
here that has

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.610
a strict subset of these wrong?

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.110
Oh, look.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:00.220
2, 3, 4, 5 is a strict subset.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.720
This can be crossed off.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.170
1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9-- anything
that's a strict subset?

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.419
Yes, 1, 6, 7, 9.

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:09.460
So it can be crossed off.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.640
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.660
Let's see.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:16.040
1, 6, 7, 9 is a strict subset.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:16.820
3, 9, 10.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.970
3, 10 is a strict subset.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.310
1, 6, 7, 9-- a strict subset.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.756
3, 4, 5, 8 is a strict
subset, as is 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:28:25.756 --> 00:28:28.000
1, 6, 7, 9 is a strict subset.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.170
And up here, 3, 4, 10--
3, 10 is a strict subset.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.185
But the others don't have
one, even 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.440
In general, you
want to keep them.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.930
You want to keep every
classifier you might use.

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.400
The only ones
you'll never use are

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.816
ones that there's something
else that's just better always

00:28:45.816 --> 00:28:50.370
by having a strict
subset of them wrong.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.810
Hopefully, that was more clear.

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:55.430
It's tricky.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:58.140
Very few people realize--
we're brave enough

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.020
to take sparkly even when
it got seven things wrong.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.670
So let's start
out some boosting.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:04.870
This wasn't boosting.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.970
This was setting yourself up.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.040
But it was setting yourself
up with the knowledge

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.260
of how boosting works.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.820
Less knowledge, less search.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.700
Now we only have to
search six things.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.158
Ah, I mean more knowledge, less
search, not less knowledge,

00:29:16.158 --> 00:29:16.980
less search.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:23.180
So we start off with
all weights being equal.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.456
And since there's
ten data points,

00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:27.330
all ten of the data
points are weighted 1/10.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.495
OK, we're now weighting
all of them equally.

00:29:33.495 --> 00:29:34.870
Since we're
weighting all of them

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:36.911
equally, when we want to
find the classifier that

00:29:36.911 --> 00:29:38.670
gets the least
error, we just want

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.360
to find the one that gets
the fewest points wrong.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.920
Which one is that?

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.020
That's our friend E, the
first one that people

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.650
realized was a good one.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.900
So we're going to
choose classifier E.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.470
What's our error?

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.940
It's just the sum of
the ones we get wrong.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.660
So what's our error this time?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.050
It's 1/5.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.057
We got points 3 and 10 wrong.

00:30:00.057 --> 00:30:01.390
They both have a weight of 1/10.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.430
1/10 plus 1/10 is 1/5.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.070
So I'll put 1/5, and alpha.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:11.760
Alpha is sort of a vote that
will be used at the very end

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.480
to aggregate our classifier.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.090
Alpha is 1/2 natural log of 1
minus the error over the error.

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.580
However, I have a
little trick for you.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.650
It's not that impressive of a
trick, but it's a little fun.

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:30.100
So since error is 1/2--
sorry, not error-- alpha.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.020
Alpha is 1/2 natural log of
1 minus error over error.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:45.403
If error is 1/x, then alpha is
1/2 natural log of x minus 1.

00:30:48.061 --> 00:30:49.980
That just follows from the math.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.150
It's a little shortcut.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.490
If error is in the
form of 1/x, then it's

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.270
just 1/2 natural
log of x minus 1,

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.290
which means since this is in
the form of 1/5, everyone,

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:03.260
alpha is?

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:04.550
1/2 ln 4.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.340
OK, 1/2 ln 4.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:17.820
So now we come to
the part in boosting

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.730
that many people consider
the hardest part,

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.090
and I'm going to show you
how to do it more easily.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.060
This is that part
where we try to make

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.316
all the ones we got right, we
change their weights to be 1/2.

00:31:27.316 --> 00:31:28.690
And all of the
ones we got wrong,

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.250
we change their
weights to be 1/2.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.960
Here is my automated process.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.287
It's called the numerator
stays the same method.

00:31:34.287 --> 00:31:35.120
Here's how it works.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.900
Here's our ten data points.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.940
Their current weight
is 1/10, all of them.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:58.900
We're about to re-weight
them for the next step.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.950
So you agree they're all 1/10?

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:03.600
They're equal, to start off.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:08.585
So step one-- erase
the denominators.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.620
Screw fractions.

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.150
I don't like them.

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.940
There's division,
multiplication.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:17.530
It's a pain.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.910
I just want to
add whole numbers.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.240
That's what we're going to do.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.150
So which ones do we get wrong?

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.100
3 and 10.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.010
Circle those.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.240
All right.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.600
Add the numbers in the
circles and multiply by 2.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.800
What does that give you?

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.456
4.

00:32:40.456 --> 00:32:41.580
That's the new denominator.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.210
AUDIENCE: Do you always
multiply by 2, or just--

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:48.900
PROFESSOR: You
always multiply by 2.

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.760
Add the numbers
not in the circles.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.571
Multiply by 2.

00:32:51.571 --> 00:32:52.570
What does that give you?

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:53.210
AUDIENCE: 16.

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.270
PROFESSOR: 16.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:56.270
That's the new denominator.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:33:00.750
The final, crucial step so that
we can do this again next round

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.476
is by far the most
mathematically

00:33:02.476 --> 00:33:03.850
complicated thing
here because we

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:06.190
have to actually do
something with fractions,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.450
but it's not too bad-- is
we then change everything

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.460
to be with the same denominator.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.975
So the 1/4's become?

00:33:13.975 --> 00:33:14.600
AUDIENCE: 4/16.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.266
PROFESSOR: 4/16.

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:22.770
All right.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.618
I can also uncircle
these for next-- ah.

00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:30.610
I hit the that button.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:31.110
All right.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:49.072
New weights-- 1/16, 1/16, 4/16,
1/16, 1/16, 1/16, 1/16, 1/16,

00:33:49.072 --> 00:33:50.760
4/16.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.619
Note, the weights add up to 1.

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:54.160
The ones you got
wrong add up to 1/2.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.040
The ones you got
right add up to 1/2.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:56.910
You're happy.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:01.700
So now that you get 4/16 of
an error for getting 3 wrong,

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.300
4/16 of an error for
getting 10 wrong,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.536
take a look at these six.

00:34:05.536 --> 00:34:06.910
I'm not going to
call on someone,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.690
just whoever's good
at math and can

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.400
add these up more quickly--
just 3 and 10 count as 4.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.530
All the others count as 1.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.554
Add them up.

00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:16.929
Tell me which
one's the lightest.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:17.637
What did you say?

00:34:17.637 --> 00:34:18.650
AUDIENCE: I'd go with B.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.774
PROFESSOR: You'd go with
B. It doesn't get 3 wrong.

00:34:20.774 --> 00:34:23.330
That sounds pretty good to me.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.889
Does everyone else
like B as well?

00:34:25.889 --> 00:34:27.159
I like it.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:31.989
I mean, all of our ones that
don't get 3 wrong or 10 wrong,

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:36.909
we're only looking at B
and D. And D has seven.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:38.750
B has four.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.360
So B is the best.

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.800
B gets 4/16 wrong.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.540
Does everyone see that?

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.920
Because even getting
one of 3 or 10 wrong

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.409
is as bad as all the ones
that B gets wrong because

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.540
of the new weights.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.270
So cool.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.540
Let's choose B. That's right.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.820
And I sort of gave it away.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.740
What's the error that B has?

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.050
It has four wrong, each
of which are worth 1/16.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.300
The error is?

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:06.900
What?

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:12.380
4/16, or 1/4, whichever
is your favorite, which

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.300
means that the alpha is?

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.530
AUDIENCE: 1/2 ln 3.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.550
PROFESSOR: 1/2 ln 3.

00:35:21.023 --> 00:35:22.450
Bingo.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.190
Final round.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:26.010
OK, what did we get wrong?

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.090
We got 1, 6, 7, and 9 wrong.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:35.405
Oh yeah, we can erase
the denominators.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.970
All right.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.050
What are the numbers in
the circles, summed up,

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.511
multiplied by 2?

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:47.010
AUDIENCE: 8.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.093
PROFESSOR: That's 8-- 1/8.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.800
And what about the numbers
not in the circle, summed up,

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.340
multiplied by 2?

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.750
AUDIENCE: 24.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.660
PROFESSOR: That's
right-- 24, which

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:01.160
means I'm going
to have to change

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:06.960
all the numbers in the circle
to 3/24, except I guess I don't

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.754
because this is the last round.

00:36:08.754 --> 00:36:10.670
But if I was going to
do another round-- let's

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.510
prepare in case we where,
change all of these to 3/24.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.127
Besides, it makes it
easier to calculate

00:36:25.127 --> 00:36:27.710
which one is the best possible
classifier because you can just

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.820
use the numerators and
sort of add them up.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.210
So while I'm writing
that up, you guys

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.370
figure out which one
you like for classifier

00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:39.590
and call it out to
me when I'm done.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.360
3/24.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.160
1/24.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.340
4/24.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.000
1/24.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.320
1/24.

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.176
3/24.

00:36:49.176 --> 00:36:49.675
3/24.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.540
1/24.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.610
3/24-- wait.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.530
I'm off by one here.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.940
3, 1, 4--

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.730
AUDIENCE: It's because w1
is not assigned to anything.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.600
So w2 is really w1.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.710
PROFESSOR: Aha.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.730
You're right.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:19.176
w1 is not assigned to anything,
so w2 is really w1 Yeah?

00:37:19.176 --> 00:37:22.902
AUDIENCE: There's an
extra 1/16 between w1, w2.

00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:25.760
There's an extra 1/16.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.390
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's true.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.057
OK, well--

00:37:29.057 --> 00:37:29.890
AUDIENCE: We get it.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.160
PROFESSOR: You get it.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.950
H, so what is the best H?

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:38.550
You get it because
it's right here.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:39.420
See?

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.580
The process is so
foolproof, even a fool

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.060
like me can get it right while
they have the chart wrong.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.220
All right, so what's
the best classifier?

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.300
AUDIENCE: C.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.382
PROFESSOR: You say C. I say
that seems pretty reasonable.

00:37:52.382 --> 00:37:54.770
It only gets 3,
4, 5, and 8 wrong.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.460
Does anyone else get
a different answer?

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.510
AUDIENCE: A.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:01.950
PROFESSOR: Someone else gets
A. I like A. Who said A?

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.690
A lot of people said A.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.750
Well, let's figure it out.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:12.000
So A gets 1, 5, 6, 7.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.740
C gets 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.900
They're, in fact, equal.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.500
Tie-break goes to
the lower letter

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.224
because that's what we said.

00:38:22.224 --> 00:38:24.390
In fact, I didn't tell you,
but that's what we said.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.965
Question?

00:38:24.965 --> 00:38:27.090
AUDIENCE: So when we were
deciding which classifier

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.540
to use, can we only
look at the weights,

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.970
or do we also have to
look at the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.160
PROFESSOR: Ignore
all previous rounds.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.700
The question is, do you only
look at the current weights

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.460
when determining a classifier?

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.530
Or do you look at the
previous rounds as well?

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:44.261
You have to ignore
the previous rounds.

00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:44.760
Trust me.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.450
They will be used
later in the vote.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:50.940
But it's sort of like
tainting the jury a little bit

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.250
to use the previous rounds when
you're doing the current round.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.910
Because you want to start
fresh with these new weights,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:57.930
get a new classifier.

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.460
And then later, everyone
will get to make their vote.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.750
So you only do it based
on the current weights.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.458
AUDIENCE: We don't
take any consideration

00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:06.309
if the last round's 6
was wrong or anything.

00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:08.850
PROFESSOR: Nope, although the
weights take into consideration

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.471
is when it's wrong,
it's going to increase.

00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:12.425
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:12.425 --> 00:39:13.379
PROFESSOR: Question?

00:39:13.379 --> 00:39:14.754
AUDIENCE: Could
you theoretically

00:39:14.754 --> 00:39:15.764
reuse a classifier?

00:39:15.764 --> 00:39:18.139
PROFESSOR: The question is,
could you theoretically reuse

00:39:18.139 --> 00:39:18.895
a classifier?

00:39:18.895 --> 00:39:21.220
Answer-- you absolutely can.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.457
When that happens, it
essentially gets extra weight

00:39:23.457 --> 00:39:24.540
because you used it again.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.680
But you can never, ever
use it twice in a row.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.460
Here's why.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.150
Let's say that we want to use--
which was the one we used last

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.650
over there?

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.170
B?

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:35.628
Let's say we wanted
to use B again.

00:39:35.628 --> 00:39:37.780
What does it give us?

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.890
50-50.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.750
If we wanted to use B and
then B-- 3, 6, 9, 12 wrong.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.820
Always guaranteed
to give you 50-50,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.420
which is the only
way that you can

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.030
be sure you'll never use it.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.880
In fact, that's by design.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.420
You could reuse it,
but not twice in a row.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.100
It could be used later
on down the stream.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.360
And it will be used.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:03.160
Because if you do seven rounds,
one of them has to be reused.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.980
It just gives more weight
to whichever one is reused.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.640
But yes, A wins against C. C
was a perfectly good answer

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.140
as well.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:10.640
Question?

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.674
AUDIENCE: Wait, can
you reuse [INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:12.674 --> 00:40:13.340
PROFESSOR: What?

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.628
AUDIENCE: Instead of A or C.

00:40:14.628 --> 00:40:15.211
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:40:15.211 --> 00:40:18.520
If you could reuse,
why doesn't he pick E?

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.380
E gets eight out of 24 wrong.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.620
It's one worse than A and
C. That's the only reason.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.760
Next step will probably
use A-- or sorry.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.660
Well, next step,
we'll probably use E,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:35.190
frankly-- although maybe not,
because we got 3 wrong on A.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.060
But pretty soon, we
would use E again

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.670
because E's pretty awesome.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:43.310
But anyway, here we used A.
And we said we got 7/24 wrong.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:45.220
Oh, man, we can't use
my little shortcut.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.450
So the answer, it has to be
17/7-- or 1/2 natural log

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.060
of 17/7.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.260
So there we go.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.870
Now, we have to ask, what is
the final classifier that we

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:04.330
created from all these things?

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:09.680
All we do is we sum up all
the classifiers we chose.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.100
And we multiply them
times their weight, alpha.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:19.020
So 1/2 ln 4 times
E, whether or not

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:28.780
E returns true, plus
1/2 ln 3 times B

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:36.370
plus 1/2 ln 17/7 times A, is
our final classifier, where

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:41.330
E returns a plus 1 if E thinks
it's a vampire, and a minus 1

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.920
if E think it's not.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.020
Same for B and A, all right?

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.180
And then we take
the sign of this.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.830
And I don't mean
sine and cosine.

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.640
I mean just, just is it
positive or negative?

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.190
OK?

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.190
So the question now on the exam
is, how many of the ten data

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.720
points do you get
right if we used this?

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.906
Let's give it a look see.

00:42:05.906 --> 00:42:09.830
E is-- so we have romantic
interest greater than 2.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.610
We have emo yes.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.140
And we have evil yes.

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.760
So oh my gosh, logarithms,
they're sometimes annoying.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.285
Do we have to
actually add them up?

00:42:20.285 --> 00:42:22.290
I claim we don't.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:24.010
Here's a nice special
case of having

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.420
three logarithms on the board.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.040
One of two things is true.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.090
Either one of those
three logarithms

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.900
is so large that it's
bigger than the other two

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:38.930
combined, in which case, if
that one returns a positive or a

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:42.830
negative, it's just positive
or negative because that one's

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:44.340
big.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.370
Or one is not that
large, and in which

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.180
case, any two can
dominate the other one,

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.710
and so is just equivalent
to a majority vote.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:57.070
So I claim we never have to add
them when there's only three.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.122
You guys see what I mean?

00:42:58.122 --> 00:43:00.330
Like, let's say one of them
was 1/2 log of a billion,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.320
and the others were 1/2
log of 3 and 1/2 log of 4.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.500
Obviously, whatever the
1/2 log of a billion

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.570
says, which is multiplied
by 1/2 log of a billion,

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.834
is it's just going to be that,
and the others will be ignored.

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:13.750
However, if it's not the
case that one of them

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.630
is larger than the
other two combined,

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.690
then it's a simple
vote between the three,

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:20.320
because any two can
out-vote the other one

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.820
if they work together.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:28.120
And in this case, let's
see, 17/7 is not quite 3.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.160
However, log of 4
is certainly not

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.900
better than log of
3 plus log of 17/7.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.820
It's not even-- log
of 4 is equal to log

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.450
of 2 plus log of 2.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.175
And these are both
bigger than log of 2.

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.930
That's rules of logs-- log
of 4 equals log of 2 squared,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.260
and you can take the 2 out.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.357
So these are not big
enough that one of them

00:43:51.357 --> 00:43:52.940
is bigger than the
other two combined.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.630
So it's just going
to be a simple vote.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:55.800
So let's go through.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.750
Dracula-- OK, he's got tons
of his little vampyrettes.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.670
He's not emo, so
E gets it right.

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.770
He's not emo.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:06.950
So that gets it wrong.

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.190
But he is evil.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.070
That gets it right.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:12.780
Two out of three vote that
he's a vampire-- correct.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:13.660
Next.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.640
Angel-- OK, well, he was
in a long running series.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.560
He's got plenty of
romantic interests.

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:22.140
So that gets it right.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.230
He's certainly emo.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.072
That gets it right.

00:44:24.072 --> 00:44:26.030
And even though he's not
evil, two out of three

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.850
says he's a vampire, so correct.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:34.010
Next, Edward Cullen-- well,
Twilight, here we come.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:34.584
Let's see.

00:44:34.584 --> 00:44:36.000
He only has one
romantic interest,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.610
so that gets it wrong.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.610
OK.

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:40.410
He's emo, so that gets it right.

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:42.150
But he's not evil, so two wrong.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.210
So Edward's not a
vampire according

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.820
to our final classifier.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.880
But he is.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.620
So we got one of the
data points wrong.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.380
You guys see that?

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:52.780
Because two out of
three of our classifiers

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:56.405
here said that he
was not a vampire.

00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:57.280
All right, let's see.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.410
Saya-- well, she has more
than two romantic interests.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:03.610
And she's emo.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.600
So even though she's not
evil, we get it right.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.290
OK?

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:08.260
Let's see.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:14.950
Lestat-- he also has
may love interests,

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.580
is emo, and is not evil.

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:18.640
So you get it right.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.140
OK, Bianca is evil with
many love interests.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:26.620
Even though she's not emo, two
out of three, you get it right.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:29.670
All right, Carmilla-- I'm
going to call her Karnstein--

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.944
is basically exactly
the same as Bianca

00:45:31.944 --> 00:45:34.360
with the number of romantic
interests fixed the way it is.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.460
So she will always do the
same thing that Bianca does.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.790
It's why 6 and 7
always travel together.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.150
So we get it right.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.710
Sailor Moon is supposed
to be not a vampire.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:47.320
So her number of love interests
say that she's not a vampire

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.040
because she only has one.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.150
The fact that she's
not evil and not emo

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.550
says that actually, she's
perfectly not a vampire.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.810
They all agree.

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:56.400
And that's correct.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.560
Squall has only one
love interest, Rinoa.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.020
And he's not evil, both of
which of say he's not a vampire.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:03.710
But he is emo.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.585
But two out of three
says he's not a vampire.

00:46:05.585 --> 00:46:06.610
We get it correct.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.190
And Circe, despite her
many romantic interests

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:10.750
which says she
might be a vampire,

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.870
is neither evil nor emo,
and is not a vampire.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.085
So we got everything right
except Edward Cullen,

00:46:16.085 --> 00:46:19.190
which perhaps says more about
Stephenie Meyers writing

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.770
than about our boosting.

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.130
All right, final
question-- Wesley Wyndham,

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:28.200
a fellow consultant, has noticed
a few correlations between some

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.780
of the classifiers you used.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:33.270
He suggests using a new set
of weak classifiers consisting

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:40.280
of a pair of your classifiers
that are logically

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.744
anded and ored together.

00:46:41.744 --> 00:46:43.410
For instance, two of
the new classifiers

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:48.960
would be emo equals yes or evil
equals yes, or sparkly equals

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.470
no and transforms equals yes.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.230
So that would cut out Sailor
Moon from the transforms cloud.

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:58.000
He believes that you'll be able
to classify large vampire data

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.980
sets-- larger than
this one, anyway--

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.160
more quickly with fewer rounds
of boosting using his system.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:04.710
Do you agree or
disagree with Wesley?

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.560
Explain your arguments.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.890
So this was, you know, the
tough concept question.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.037
Does anyone have just an
instinctual thing other

00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:13.370
than like, oh, man, it's Wesley.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:14.440
He must be wrong.

00:47:18.851 --> 00:47:20.601
AUDIENCE: You'll
probably use fewer rounds

00:47:20.601 --> 00:47:23.487
of boosting because you
have more classifiers.

00:47:23.487 --> 00:47:26.800
But you'll have to search
through more classifiers.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.360
PROFESSOR: Aha, that is
the rare full-point answer.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.420
Very few people realize that
Wesley was partially right.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:35.920
They either said something about
him being completely wrong,

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.220
which was wrong, or said
that he was completely right.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.740
Yes, it will use fewer rounds
of boosting because of the fact

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:45.970
that you can-- essentially,
one of these boosting already

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.410
does is sort of gets
things to vote together

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:50.860
in an [INAUDIBLE] fashion.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.662
So it will use
approximately half

00:47:52.662 --> 00:47:54.370
the number of rounds
of boosting by being

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.770
able to combine into two.

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.300
But there's a lot
of ands and ors.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.830
There's in fact
n choose 2, where

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:01.620
n is the number of vampires.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.340
And since using half the
number of rounds but taking n

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.040
choose 2 time for each
round is not less time.

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.200
So that's exactly correct.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.520
Not that many people got
full credit on that one

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.201
because sometimes, they were
seduced by Wesley's idea.

00:48:16.201 --> 00:48:17.700
Or they were just
like, it's Wesley.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:23.080
He's wrong-- or just
some other funny answer.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.080
Any questions about boosting?

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.580
Question?

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.848
AUDIENCE: How do you know
how many rounds of boosting

00:48:27.848 --> 00:48:28.677
to take?

00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:30.260
PROFESSOR: The
question is, how do you

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.690
know how many rounds
of boosting to do?

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.140
The answer is--
so on the quiz, it

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:38.070
tells you that you have three.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.830
In real life, you might
want to just kind of keep

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.100
it running until it converges.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.330
That's one possibility--
keep it running

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.204
until it converges
to an answer, and it

00:48:51.204 --> 00:48:52.370
doesn't do anything anymore.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:56.592
Patrick has a little widget
on the 6.034 website, I think,

00:48:56.592 --> 00:48:58.300
that lets you plunk
down some data points

00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.710
and run boosting on them.

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:03.640
And you can see that
eventually, it converges.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.932
The boosting converges to an
answer, and it doesn't change.

00:49:06.932 --> 00:49:09.524
AUDIENCE: What converges?

00:49:09.524 --> 00:49:12.390
PROFESSOR: Basically,
the-- not the classifiers

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.050
you picked, of course,
or the weights.

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:17.100
But what converges is
which ones of your data set

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.470
you get correct.

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.720
Because he does his in
two-dimensional space

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.114
rather than like this.

00:49:23.114 --> 00:49:24.780
And he shows you the
lines that boosting

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.196
is drawing between
classification,

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:29.320
and colors things in green and
red or something like that.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.604
And eventually, it converges
where the lines are

00:49:31.604 --> 00:49:33.020
and which ones
it's getting right.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.470
It generally converges to
getting everything correct.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:40.030
And when that happens,
then you can stop.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:41.240
But that's a good question.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.830
And it's not always that
easy in the real world.

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.330
You have to sometimes just
say, this is enough for me.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.230
I've given it n
number of rounds.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.320
And that's much more the
number of classifiers,

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.300
so maybe it won't
get anything better.
