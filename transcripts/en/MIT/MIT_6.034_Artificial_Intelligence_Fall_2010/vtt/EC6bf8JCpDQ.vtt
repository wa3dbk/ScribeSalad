00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.320
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: I was
in Washington for most of

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.050
the week prospecting for gold.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.820
Another byproduct of that was
that I forgot to arrange a

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.330
substitute Bob Berwick for
the Thursday recitations.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.070
I shall probably go
to hell for this.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.830
In any event, we have
many explanations,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670
none of them good.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.680
But today we'll try to get back
on track and you'll learn

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.800
something fun.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.060
In particular you will learn how
a graduate student of mine

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.940
Mark [? Phillipson ?], together
with a summer UROP

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.980
student, Brett van Zuiden,
one of you--

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.390
managed to pull off a tour de
force and recognize in these

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.610
two descriptions the pattern
that we humans commonly call

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.860
"revenge." It was discovered.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.090
The system didn't have a
name for it, of course.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.160
It just knew that there was a
pattern there and sat waiting

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.340
for us to give a name to it.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.635
That's where we're
going to end up.

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.840
But it'll be a bit of a journey
before we get there,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.040
because we've got to
go through all that

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.250
stuff on the outline.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.740
And in particular, we want
to start off by a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.910
little tiny bit of review.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.310
Because some of the stuff
we did last time

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.440
went by pretty fast.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.630
In particular, you may remember
they had this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.220
wonderful joint probability
table, which tells us all we

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.230
want to know, all
we want to know.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.950
We can decide what the
probability of the police

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.520
being called is given the this
and the that, and all that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.080
sort of stuff, by clicking
the appropriate boxes.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.920
The trouble is, gee, there are
only three variables there.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.560
And when there are lots of
variables it gets pretty hard

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.010
to make up those numbers or
to even collect them.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.550
So we're driven to
an alternative.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.890
And we got to that alternative
just at the end of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.210
the show a week ago.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.750
And we got to the point where
we were defining these

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.370
inference nets, sometimes called
"Bayes nets." And the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.580
one we worked with
looked like this.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.060
There's a burglar, a raccoon,
the possibility of a dog

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.500
barking, the police being
called, and a trash can being

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.720
overturned.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.620
So more variables than that.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.580
That only has three.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.420
This has got five.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.590
But we're able to do some magic
with this because we, as

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.960
humans, when we define--

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.130
when we draw this graph we're
making an assertion about how

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.740
things depend or don't depend
on one another.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.410
In particular, there's something
to break down and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.240
memorize to the point where
it rolls off your tongue.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.240
And that is that any variable on
this graph is said by me to

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.310
be independent of any other

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.500
non-descendant given its parents.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.770
Independent of any

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.690
non-descendant given its parents.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.930
So that means that the
probability of the dog

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.340
barking, given its parents,
doesn't depend on T, the trash

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.930
can being overturned.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.900
Because the intuition is all
of the causality is flowing

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.800
through the parents and can't
get to this variable D without

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.440
going through the parents.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.680
So that is [? inserted ?]

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.290
property of the nets
that we draw.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.960
And we tend to draw them in a
way that reflects causality.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.000
So it tends to make sense.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.330
So somehow this thing
is going to be--

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.710
we're going to use this thing
instead of that thing.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.880
But wait.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.920
We may need that thing in
order to do all the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.530
computations we want
to perform.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.930
So we need to be able to show
that we can get to that thing

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.160
by doing calculations
on this thing.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.300
So what to do?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.100
Well, we're going to
use the chain rule.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.450
And remember that the chain rule
came to us by way of the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.250
basic Axioms of Probability
plus the definition plus a

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.580
little colored chalk.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.570
So we got to the point
last time where we

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.750
sort of believed this.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.920
It's a really magical thing.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.670
It says that the probability
of all this stuff happening

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.170
together is given as the
product of a bunch of

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.470
conditional probabilities.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.380
And the conditional
probabilities in this product

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.430
are arranged such that this
first guy depends

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.500
on everybody else.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.050
The second guy doesn't depend
on the first guy but depends

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.690
on everything else.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.850
So that list of dependencies
gets smaller and smaller as

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.380
you go down here until it
depends only one thing.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.050
There's no conditional at all.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.780
So that's going to come to our
rescue because it enables us

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.210
to go from calculations in
here to that whole table.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.740
But first I have to show you a
little bit more slowly how

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.720
that comes to be.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.800
One thing I'm going to do
before I think about

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.650
probability is I'm going to
make a linear list of all

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.330
these variables.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.290
And the way I'm going to make
it is I'm going to chew away

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.030
at those variables
from the bottom.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.810
I've taken advantage
of a very important

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.630
property of these nets.

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.490
And that is there no loops.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.090
You can follow the arrows
in any way so as

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.470
you get back to yourself.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.200
So there's always going
to be a bottom.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.300
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, well, there are

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.410
two bottoms here, there's C
and T. So I have a choice.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:02.330
I'm going to choose C. So I'm
going to take that off and

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.570
pretend it's not
there anymore.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.980
Then I'm going to
take this guy.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.430
That's now a bottom because
there's nothing below it.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.430
I've already taken C out.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.590
So we'll take that out next.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.440
And now I've got this guy,
this guy, and this guy.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.170
This guy no longer has
anything below it.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.430
So I can list it next.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.590
Now over here I've got
raccoon and trashcan.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.450
But trashcan is at the bottom.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.040
So I've got to take it next
because I'm working

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.011
from the bottom up.

00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:40.760
I want to ensure that there are
no descendants before me

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.940
in this list.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.780
So finally I get to raccoon.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.930
So the way I constructed this
list like so ensures that this

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.020
list arranges the elements so
that for any particular

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.210
element, none of
its descendants

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.460
appear to its left.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.260
And now that's the magical order
for which I want to use

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.030
the chain rule.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.960
So now I can write--

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.260
I can pick C to be
my variable n.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.530
And I can say that the chain
rule says that the joint

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.410
probability of all these
variables P of C,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.140
D, B, T, and R--

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.360
the probability of any
particular combination of

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.140
those things is equal to the
probability of C given

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.390
everybody else.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.190
Next in line is D given
everybody else.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.400
Next in line is T--

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.420
next in line is B given
everybody else.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.720
And next in line is T given
everybody else.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:10.840
And finally, just R. So this
combination of things has a

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.145
probability that is given by
this chain rule expression.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.010
Ah.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.500
But first of all, none of those
expressions condition

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.740
any of the variables on
anything other than

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.970
non-descendants, all right?

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.650
That's just because of the way
I've arranged the variables.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.950
And I can always do that
because are no loops.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.169
I can always chew away
at the bottom.

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.140
That ensures that whenever I
write a variable, it's going

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.440
to be conditioned on stuff other
than its descendants.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.190
So all of these variables in
any of these conditional

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.700
probabilities are
non-descendants.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.740
Oh wait.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.510
When I drew this diagram, I
asserted that no variable

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.680
depends on any non-descendant
given its parents.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.950
So if I know the parents of
a variable I know that the

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.895
variable is independent of all
other non-descendants.

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:07.320
All right?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.590
Now I can start scratching
stuff out.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.690
Well, let's see.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.120
I know that C, from my diagram,
has only one parent,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.080
D. So given its parent, it's
independent of all other

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.730
non-descendants.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.980
So I can scratch them out.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:33.470
D he has two parents, B and R.
But given that, I can scratch

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:34.720
out any other non-descendant.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.460
B is conditional on T and R.
Ah, but B has no parent.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.120
So it actually is independent
of those two guys.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.330
The trashcan, yeah, that's
dependent on R. And R over

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.640
here, the final thing in the
chain, that's just a

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.160
probability.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.390
So now I have a way of
calculating any entry in that

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.960
table because any entry in that
table is going to be some

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.880
combination of values for
all those variables.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440
Voila.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.320
So anything I can do with a
table, I can do in principle

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.580
with this little network.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.920
OK?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.480
But now the question is, I've
got some probabilities I'm

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.100
going to have to figure
out here.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.570
So let me draw a slightly
different version of it.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:32.030
So up here we've got the a
priori probability of B. Well,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:46.680
that's just probability of B.
Down here with the dog, I've

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.350
got a bigger table because I've
got probabilities that

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.950
depend on the values
of its parents.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.620
The probability of dog barking
depends on the condition of

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.560
the parents, nothing else.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.070
So let's see.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.920
I've got to have a column for
B. I've got to have a column

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.940
for the burglar and
the raccoon.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.940
And there are a bunch of
possibilities for those guys.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.050
But once I get those then I'll
be able to calculate the

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.670
probability of the
dog barking.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.910
So there are two of
these variables.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.310
So there are four
combinations.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:30.390
There's T T. There's
T R, R T, and--

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.134
whoa, what am I doing?

00:11:32.134 --> 00:11:34.050
Wake up!

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.720
T false.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.930
False true.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.890
And false false.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.060
So what I really want to do is
I want to calculate all of

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:45.070
these probabilities that give
the probability of the dog

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.210
condition of the burglar
and the raccoon.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.070
Similarly, I want to calculate
the probability of B happening

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.200
doesn't depend on
anything else.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.590
So I don't know what to do.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.660
Well, what I'm going to actually
do is I'm going to do

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.410
the same thing I had
to do up there.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:06.630
I'm going to keep track of--

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.640
I'm going to try a bunch of--

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.560
I'm going to get myself together
a bunch of data.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.910
Maybe I do a bunch
of experiments.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.730
Maybe somebody hands it to me.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:16.030
But I'm going to use that data
to construct a bunch of

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.990
tallies which are going to end
up giving me the probabilities

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.150
for all of those things.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.160
So I don't know, let's see.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.440
How should we start?

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.290
Step one, find colored chalk.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.870
Step two, I'm going to extend
these tables a little bit so I

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.120
can keep track of the tallies.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.580
So this is going to be all
the ones that end up in a

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.980
particular row.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.450
And these are going to be the
ones for which dog is true.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.960
Similarly, I'm going to extend
this guy up here in order to

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.020
keep track of some tallies.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:00.020
This is going to be the ones
for which B is true.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.240
And this one will be all.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.680
So that's my set up.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.490
And now suppose that my first
experiment comes roaring in.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.060
And it's all T's.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:21.720
So I have T T T. That's my first
experimental result, my

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.170
first data item.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.480
So let's see.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.010
The arrangement here is
burglar, raccoon, dog.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.040
So burglar as a true.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.510
And there's one tally
count in there.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.280
Likewise, the T T, that's the
burglar and the raccoon, that

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.190
brings me down to
this first row.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.200
So that gives me one tally in
there and dog is true so that

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.475
gives me a tick mark
in that one.

00:13:52.475 --> 00:13:53.190
All right?

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.240
Are you with me so far?

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.850
And now let's suppose
that the next thing

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.100
happens be all false.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.020
Well, burglar is false.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.545
But there is one experiment.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:09.980
Everybody's false.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.500
So we come down here
to false false.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.810
And that's the row we're
going to work on.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.650
We get a tally in there.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.150
Do we put one in here?

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.860
No, because that's false.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:22.785
Dog is false.

00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:25.650
That's what our data
element says.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:26.640
So that's cool.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.050
Maybe one more.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:37.210
Let's suppose we have T T F.
Well in that case, we have a

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.020
tick mark here and a tick mark
here because the burglar

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.360
element is true.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.040
Then we have T T. That brings
us to the first row again.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.180
So we get a tick mark there.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:53.500
But dog as false, so
no tick mark there.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.170
That's how it works.

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.550
I suppose you'd like to see
a demonstration, right?

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.030
Always like to see
a demonstration.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.850
So here's what it actually
looks like.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.060
So on the left you see the
network as we've constructed

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.420
it, with a bunch probabilities
there.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.850
And what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to start

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.850
simulating away so as to
accumulate tick marks, tally

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.160
marks, and see what kinds of
probabilities that they

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.920
indicate for the table.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.610
I happen to be using a process
for which the model on the

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:29.070
left is a correct reflection.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.540
So there's one simulation.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.460
So the dog barking--

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.800
let's see, the burglar
is false.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.600
The raccoon is true.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.710
I get one tick mark.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.130
So the probability
there is one.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.300
Of course, I'm not going
to just go with one.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.840
I want to put a whole bunch
of stuff in there.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.300
So I'll just run a bunch
more simulations.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:51.270
No [? dice. ?]

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.746
I don't even have an entry
at all yet for T F here.

00:15:54.746 --> 00:15:57.210
That's because I haven't
run enough data.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.280
So let me clear it instead of
doing it one at a time.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.280
Let me run 100 simulations.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.450
See, it's still not too good.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:07.500
Because it says this T
T probability true.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.910
This just because I'm feeding
it data, right?

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.730
And I'm keeping track of what
the data elements tell me

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.470
about how frequently a

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.180
particular combination appears.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.680
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.668
STUDENT: So when you're doing
one simulation, is that

00:16:20.668 --> 00:16:22.162
[INAUDIBLE] variables?

00:16:22.162 --> 00:16:23.832
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: When
I'm doing one simulation,

00:16:23.832 --> 00:16:26.930
I'm just keeping track of
that combination in

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:28.800
each of these tables.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.630
Because it's going to tell
me something about the

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:33.730
probabilities that I want
reflected in those tables.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.090
So it's pretty easy to see when
I go up here to burglar.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.920
If I have a lot of data
elements, they're all going to

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.730
tell me something about
the burglar as well

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.280
as the other variables.

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.910
So if I just look at that
burglar thing, the fraction of

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.850
time that it turns out true over
all the data elements is

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.150
going to be its probability.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.610
So now when I go down to the
joint tables, I can still get

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:54.630
these probability numbers.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.400
But now they're conditioned
on reticular

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.010
condition of its parents.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.430
So that's how I get these
probabilities.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.700
So I didn't do too well here
because that T T combination

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.580
gave me an excessively
high probability.

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:10.130
So maybe 100 simulations
isn't enough.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:15.339
Let's run 10,000.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.560
So with that much data running
through, the probabilities I

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.310
get-- let's see, I've got 893
here, instead of 0.9, 807

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.880
instead of 0.8, 607
instead of 0.6.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.500
And that one's dead-on
at 0.01.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.570
So if I run enough of these
simulations, I get a pretty

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.220
good idea what the probabilities
ought to be

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.030
given that I've got
a correct model.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.860
OK, so that takes care
of that one.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.880
And of course, I didn't draw
the other things in here.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.800
But by extension, you can see
how those would work.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.180
Oh.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:46.810
But you know what?

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.895
I think I will put a little
probability of

00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:50.145
raccoon table in here.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.390
Because the next thing I
want to do is I want to

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.470
go the other way.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:59.365
This is recoding tallies
from some process so I

00:17:59.365 --> 00:18:00.730
can develop a model.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.670
But once I've got these
probabilities, of course, then

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.780
I can start to simulate what
the model would do.

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.610
All right?

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.690
How would I do that?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:16.220
Well, do I want to use
the same table?

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.050
I think just to keep things
sanitary, what I'll do is I'll

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.340
go over here and do it again.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:27.260
Here's B. It's got a probability
of B. Here's R.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:33.300
Here's a table probability of
R. That comes down into a

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.070
joint table for dog.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.320
And it's got four elements.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.940
Depending on the burglar
condition and the raccoon

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:51.270
condition, we get a probability
of dog.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.990
And now, imagine these have
all been filled in.

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.290
So what do I want to do if I
want to simulate this system

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:02.130
generating some combination of
values for all the variables?

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.870
Well, I do the opposite of what
I did when I was working

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:09.070
around with this chain rule
showing that I could go from

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.480
the table to those
probabilities.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.660
Now I've got the
probabilities.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.450
I'm going to go the
other direction.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.100
Instead of chewing away from the
bottom, I'm going to chew

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.660
away from the top.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.740
Because when I go into the top
and chew way, everything I

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.560
need to know to do a
coin flip is there.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.970
So in particular, when I go
up in here, I've got the

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.350
probability of burglar now.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.250
So I'm going to use that
probability to flip a coin.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.950
Say it produces a T. So that
takes care of this guy.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.730
And I can now scratch it off
since it's no longer in

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:44.390
consideration.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.940
It's no longer a top variable.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.330
So now I go over into raccoon
and I do the same thing.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.190
I take this probability.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.310
I do a flip.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:59.130
And say it produces an F.
Whatever its probability is, I

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.350
flip a biased coin and that's
what I happen to get.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:06.340
But now, having dealt with these
two guys, that uncovers

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.230
this dog thing.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.330
And I've got enough information,
because I've done

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.286
everything above, to make the
calculation for whether to dog

00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:15.510
is going to be barking or not.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.520
But wait.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.530
I have to know that I've got a T
and a T and a T and an F and

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:27.060
an F and a T and an F and an
F. Because I have to select

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.820
the right row.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.610
So I know that B is T. And I
know that R is F. So that

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:39.570
takes me into the table
into the second row.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.360
So now I get this probability.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.850
I flip that coin and I get some
result, say, T. Voila.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.810
I can do that with the
other two variables.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.390
And I've got myself an
experimental trial that is

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.620
produced in accordance with the

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.219
probabilities of the table.

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:00.469
OK?

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:04.640
Of course--

00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:13.730
yeah, in fact, how did
I get those numbers?

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.990
Actually what I did is I used
the model on the left to

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.330
generate the samples that
were used to compute the

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.240
probabilities on the right.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.910
So you've seen that a
demonstration of this already.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.330
Now of course--

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:36.400
I don't know, all of this sort
of depends on having

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.030
everything right.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:42.130
I've written a thing to write
it one more time.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:51.580
Burglar, raccoon, dog, call
the police, trashcan.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:54.440
But somebody else may say, oh,
you've got it all wrong.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.690
This is what it really
looks like.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.780
The dog doesn't care about
the raccoon at all.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.130
So that's a correct model.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.380
Now when I do a simulation, I
could fill in the tables in

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.810
either model, right?

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:10.800
I'm sure you'd like to
see a demonstration.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.420
So let me show you a
demonstration of that.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.040
So there are the two tables.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.060
And I can run 10,000
simulations

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.310
on those guys, too.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.270
Now, look.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.150
The guy on the left is a pretty
good reflection of the

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:37.630
probabilities in a model I
used to produce the data.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.253
But the guy on the right doesn't
know any better. it

00:22:39.253 --> 00:22:42.960
just fills in its
own tables, too.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.950
So what to do?

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.060
I say this one's the
right model.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.370
And you say that one's
the right model.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.090
Who's right?

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.120
Maybe we'll never know.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.830
And the guy on the left will get
rich in the stock market

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.630
and the guy on the right
will go broke.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.370
I would be nice if
we could actually

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.520
figure out who's right.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.466
So would you to see how to
figure out who's right?

00:23:07.466 --> 00:23:09.220
Yeah, so would I. What we're
going to do is we're going to

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.490
look at naive Bayesian
inference.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.660
And that's our next chore.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.740
So here's how it works.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.800
We know, from the definition of
conditional probability, we

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.530
know that the probability of
A given B is equal to the

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.660
probability of A and
B divided by the

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.520
probability of B, right?

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.400
Equal to by definition.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:43.540
So that means that the
probability of A given B times

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.240
the probability of B--

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.680
I'm just multiplying it out--

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.050
it equal to that joint
probability.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:57.715
Oh, but by symmetry, there's no
harm in saying I can turn

00:23:57.715 --> 00:24:02.450
that around and say that the
probability of B given A times

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.000
the probability of B is also
equal to that joint

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.690
probability, right?

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.750
I've just expanded it a
different and symmetric way.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:18.630
If I've got to write a, b on
B, b, a on A. Thank you.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:19.590
Who was complaining?

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.840
Good work.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.800
That would have been a
major-league disaster.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.910
But now, having written that, I
can forget about the middle.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.730
Because all I'm really
interested in is how I've

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:37.070
turned the probabilities around
in that conditional.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.570
Why would I care about
doing that?

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.760
By the way, we're now talking
about the work of

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.010
the Reverend Bayes.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.420
Because we can rewrite this yet
again as the probability

00:24:50.420 --> 00:25:00.160
of A given B is equal to the
probability of B given A times

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.420
the probability of A divided
by the probability of B.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.790
That's just elementary
algebra.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:13.460
But now I'm going to do
something magical.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.670
I'm going to say I've got a
classification problem.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.120
I want to know which
disease you have.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.660
That's a classification
problem.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.120
Maybe you've got
the swine flu.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.790
Maybe you've got indigestion.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:30.740
Who knows.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.470
But I get all these symptoms.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.950
I get all these pieces
of evidence.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.450
You've got a fever.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:38.140
You're throwing--

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.470
oh, well, let's not go into
too much detail, there.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.060
But what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, well, let's

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:48.490
suppose that A is equal to a
class that I'm interested in,

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:50.050
the disease you've got.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:56.510
And B is equal to the evidence,

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.760
the symptoms I observe.

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.240
Voila.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.150
I may have a pretty hard time
figuring out what the

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.260
probability of the class
is given the evidence.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.920
But figuring out the probability
of the evidence

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.420
given the class might
not be so hard.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.500
Let me get another board in play
and show you what I mean.

00:26:20.128 --> 00:26:24.820
By plugging class and evidence
into Bayes' rule, what I get

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:31.540
is the probability of some class
given the evidence is

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.710
equal to the probability of the
evidence given the class

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.060
times the probability of the
class divided by the

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.690
probability of the evidence.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.230
Now you've got to let that
sing to you a little bit.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:51.590
Suppose I've got several classes
that I'm trying to

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.270
decide between.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.500
I'm trying to select the best
out of that batch of classes.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.800
Well, I've got the evidence.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.140
And if I know the probability of
the evidence given each of

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.130
those classes, and if I know,
a priori, the initial

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.950
probability the class,
then I'm done.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:12.910
Because I've got the two
elements in the numerator.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.590
Why am I done?

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.630
Because the denominator is the
same for all the classes.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:21.490
It's just the probability
of the evidence.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.870
And then I could just
sum everything up.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.440
I know it adds to 1 anyway.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.440
So that's cool.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.240
But sometimes there's
evidence--

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.980
actually there's more than
one piece of evidence.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.660
Let's say that there's
some class.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.330
some i, and we're trying to
figure out if that's the

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.720
correct class.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.000
So we've got c sub i there
and c sub i there.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.420
And suppose that that evidence
is actually a bunch of pieces

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.780
of evidence.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:56.580
So it could be e sub
1, e sub n, oops,

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.880
premature right bracket.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:03.430
All that evidence, given the
class i times the probability

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.820
of the class i over some
denominator that we don't care

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.700
about because it's going to
be the same for everybody.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.110
So we'll just write that as d.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.160
Now what if these pieces of
evidence are all independent

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.410
given the class?

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.590
So if you have the swine flu,
the probability you have a

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.117
fever is independent of the
probability you're going to

00:28:28.117 --> 00:28:31.610
throw up, say.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.280
Then can we write this
another way?

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.150
An easier way?

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.580
Sure.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.180
Because when things are
independent, the joint

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.330
probability is equal to the
product of the individual

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.190
probabilities.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.910
So that is to say--

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.670
it's easier to see it if you
write it down than if

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.700
you just say it--

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.200
this probability here from these
two elements here is

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.280
equal to the probability of e
sub 1 conditioned on c sub i

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.970
times the probability of e sub
2 conditioned on c sub i, all

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.080
the way down to the probability
of e sub n

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.800
conditioned on c sub i divided
by some denominator we don't

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.480
care about.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.860
See, what I'm going to try to do
is I'm going to go through

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.240
this for all the ci and see
which one's the biggest.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.620
STUDENT: That's the [INAUDIBLE]
ci, right?

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.070
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: This
is the probability of--

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.470
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.870
right-hand side [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.990
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
Right here?

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.820
Oh yes, you're quite right.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.070
Oh yeah, thanks.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.775
I can't write and think
at the same time.

00:29:46.775 --> 00:29:49.410
Thanks.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:49.770
OK.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.700
So I've just figure out which
one of these is the biggest.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.150
And I've identified the class.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.490
Now you say to me, well, I would
like to see an example.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.870
So--

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.050
I don't know, does anyone
have any spare change?

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.300
A nickel, a quarter.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.190
This is not because of
infinitesimally low raises

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.960
here at MIT.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.180
I just need it for
a demonstration.

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.180
I need two coins.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.140
Don't forget to get these
back, I tend to be--

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.280
Now suppose these two coins
are not exactly the same.

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.200
One of these points is a
legitimate, highly-prized

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.160
American quarter.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.100
The other one is a fake.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.960
And with this one, the
probability of heads, let us

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.050
say, is 0.8 instead of 0.5.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.710
So I mix these all up.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.960
And I pick one.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.520
And I start flipping it.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.540
And I get a head.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.390
Then I flip it again.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.040
And I get a tail.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:58.750
Which coin did I pick?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.480
Well, we're going to use this
stuff to figure it out.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.730
Here's what happens.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.500
Before I forget.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.440
Thank you very much.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.430
So what we've done is
we've selected these

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.810
things from my hands.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:24.390
And I can't draw hands.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:27.210
So I'll draw a little
cup here.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:28.700
And there are two
coins in here.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:29.610
And we're going to pick one.

00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:35.690
And one has a probability
of heads equal to 0.8.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:40.913
And this one has a probability
of a head of 0.5.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.900
So here's the draw.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.060
I pick one.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.840
Each has a probability of 0.5.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.020
This one is the one with
the 0.8 as the

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.300
probability of head.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.500
And this one is the
one with the

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:03.270
probability of 0.5 as a head.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.570
OK?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:12.910
So now suppose the first flips
as it was is T. Well, that's a

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.382
piece of evidence.

00:32:14.382 --> 00:32:15.310
That's here.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.230
Probably of evidence
given the class.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:22.240
Well in the case of having drawn
this biased coin, the

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:29.740
probability of coming up with a
tail-- ah, let's say a head,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.890
just to make my numbers
a little easier.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:38.010
Probability of coming out there
with a head is equal 0.8

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.810
given that it's up here
in this choice.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:46.265
The probability given that you
have a fair coin is 0.5.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:59.230
So now if we take the next coin
and take it to be a tail

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.990
then the probability
of this guy given

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:06.610
that evidence is 0.2.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.900
And the probability of this guy
given that evidence-- it's

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.050
a fair coin, so it
doesn't care.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.300
It's still 0.5.

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:16.100
So now what's the probability
of this

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.710
class given this evidence?

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:25.804
It's the product 0.5 times
0.8 times 0.2.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:28.590
And what's the probability
of this guy?

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:34.800
It's 05 times 0.5 times 0.5,
divided by a denominator which

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.520
is the same in both cases.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.230
So let's forget about
this early 0.5 here.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.650
Because it's the same
in both cases.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.660
And we just multiply those
numbers together.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.940
That gives us 0.8 times 0.2.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.440
What's that?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.030
0.16?

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.010
And this guy, 0.5 times
0.5, that's 0.25.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.610
So it looks an awful lot like--
with this combination--

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.050
that I've picked the
coin that's fair.

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.260
One more flip?

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.870
So let's flip it again,
and suppose we

00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.499
come up with a head.

00:34:13.499 --> 00:34:16.520
So that puts a 0.8 in here.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.170
And 0.5 in here.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:29.590
When you multiply those
out that's 0.125.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:34.980
And this is 0.128.

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.830
So it's about equal.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.333
So you see how that works?

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:41.630
All right.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.560
So we're using the coin flips
as evidence to figure out

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.239
which class is involved.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:49.840
OK so I don't know, you'd
probably like to see a

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.370
demonstration of this,
too, right?

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:56.270
You say to me, gosh, just
two kinds of coins.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.970
That's not very interesting.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.570
Let's try five kinds of coins.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:08.650
So what I want to show you is
how the probabilities for all

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.130
these coins-- there are five
of them, color-coded--

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:15.700
how the probabilities vary
with a series of flips.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.010
Let's suppose I've
got a head--

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.080
the grey line, by the way, is
the fraction of heads--

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:22.820
so that's going to be one.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.500
Because I'm just doing heads.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.830
You see that black
line rising?

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.250
Should look like a rocket.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.500
That's the probability
that the--

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.060
that's the coin which only shows
heads, the probability

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.310
of head is 1.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.370
And I'm flipping a whole
bunch of heads here.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:43.980
Isn't that cool?

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.920
Now what happens if I suddenly
put in a tail?

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.280
By the way, you'll no doubt,
here one the extreme left--

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.300
the initial probability of
the P=0 coin was 0.1.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.950
As soon as I flipped a
head that went to 0.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.930
And it will never get
off 0, right?

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:03.450
That makes sense.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.570
Because if the probability that
you'll get a head is 1

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:06.760
you should never see a tail.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.030
If you ever do, that
isn't your coin.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:13.260
What happens now if I interrupt
a series of heads

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.957
and produce a tail?

00:36:14.957 --> 00:36:16.418
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:16.418 --> 00:36:17.392
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON:
What's that?

00:36:17.392 --> 00:36:18.860
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.240
PROFESSOR PATRICK WINSTON: The
black one will go to 0.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.655
What else happens?

00:36:21.655 --> 00:36:24.470
By the way, the blue one is
the one with the highest

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.400
probability of being a head.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:29.850
Boom!

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.720
That blue one shot up.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.910
Not going up slowly.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.320
It shot up.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.640
Because now the preponderance
of evidence with all those

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:43.130
heads is that I've flipped the
coin with a bias of 0.75

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.820
towards heads.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.540
So let's clear this.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.680
Pick any probability you want.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.160
0.25, 0.5, and so on.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.260
I don't know, let's pick
0.25 since we've been

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.510
at the upper end.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.650
So orange is 0.25.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.200
And sure enough, the probability
that I've selected

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.900
the 0.5 coin is going up and
up and up and up after the

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.540
original irregularity.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.610
The Law of Large Numbers
is setting in.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:14.030
And a probability that I've got
that 0.25 coin in play is

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.660
pretty close to 1.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:16.910
All right.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.360
So that's cool.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.590
Now you say to me, that's
awfully nice but stop.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:30.280
Awfully nice, but not
very real-world-ish.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.520
So let me give you
another problem.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.930
It's well-known that you are,
with high probability, of the

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.660
same political persuasion
as your parents.

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.620
So if I wanted to figure out
which party a parent belongs

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.140
to, I could look at the
party that their

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.490
children belong to, right?

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.090
So it's just like
flipping coins.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.770
The particular coin
I have chosen

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.680
corresponds to the parent.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.620
Individual flips correspond to
the political party that the

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.070
child belongs to.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.200
So let's get up a little bit--

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.890
by the way, I wrote all this
stuff over the weekend.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.610
So who knows if any
of it will work.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:13.430
But let's see.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.040
A parent party classifier.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.530
There it is, Democrats
and Republicans.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.330
And now the prior for being a
Republican given here is 0.5.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.300
But I don't know, this is a
little bit Democratic state.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.780
So let's adjust that
down a little bit.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.640
Somewhere in there might be
about right But let's just,

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.370
for the sake of a classroom
illustration, go down here.

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.650
So now the meter is showing the
prior probability because

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.510
that's the only thing in
the formula so far.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.340
I've got no evidence.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.610
So now let's suppose that
child number one is a

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.380
Republican.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.850
Back to neutral.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.910
So I've got a low probability
that the parent--

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:59.810
a priori probability that the
parent is a Republican and a

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:01.870
child who's a Republican.

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.670
I notice that 0.2 and 0.8,
the conditional is 0.8.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.620
And the prior is 0.2.

00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:09.690
That's why it comes out to
balance each other, right?

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.230
So now if we get another
Republican in

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.080
there it goes way up.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.860
If I have a Democratic child
it goes back down.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.180
If I have an equal balance
between children then it goes

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:22.320
way back down because of that
prior probability being low.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.280
So if I make that high, even
though the children are

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.865
balanced, I'm still going to
have a high probability of

00:39:29.865 --> 00:39:32.250
being a Republican.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.140
Now let's see.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:36.180
If I take that slider there, the
conditional probability,

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.800
and drive it to the left
here-- let me make that

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.180
equally in.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.760
And let's make that one thing.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.620
I don't know.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.766
What am I doing now?

00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:52.460
If I make the probability less
than 0.5, what's that mean?

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:54.510
That means you're sore at your
parents and you want to belong

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.720
to a different party.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.200
All right, so now,
what's next?

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.650
Oh gosh.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:05.900
What's next?

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.870
This is what's next.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.220
What's next to somewhere?

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.440
Yeah, this is what's next.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.210
This here.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.460
We've got two models.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:28.070
Remember when I said we wanted
to decide between them?

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:30.930
Can we use that Bayesian
hack to do that, too?

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:31.580
Sure.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.790
Because we've got these
two models.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.770
We've got the probabilities
in them.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.490
So now I can take my data and
calculate the probability of a

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:45.620
left model given the data and
the probability of the right

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.780
model given the data, multiply
that times their a priori

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.860
probabilities, which I'll
assume are equal.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.710
Then I can do a model selection
deal much in

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.250
defiance to what I was
hinting at before.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.500
so let's try that.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.720
Whoa.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.915
There are my two models.

00:41:08.915 --> 00:41:10.460
Yes, there they are.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.850
We've already trained them up.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.990
And they've got their
probabilities.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.630
Now what we're going to do
is we're going to use the

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.950
original model to simulate
the data.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:21.350
So what we're going to do is
we're going to simulate draws,

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:25.770
simulate events, similarly
combinations of all variables

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:30.626
using a model that looks like
the one on the left, that is

00:41:30.626 --> 00:41:32.530
the one on the left except for
the slight differences in

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:34.320
probabilities, OK?

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.570
Then we're going to do this
Bayesian thing and see where

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.880
the meter goes.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.020
So we'll run one data point.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.960
Oops, went the wrong way.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960
Makes me nervous.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.750
I just finished this at 9:15.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.610
Maybe there's a bug.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.720
Oops, two data points,
swings to the left.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.140
Three data points, back
to the right.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.070
Of course that's
not much data.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:56.685
So let's put some
more data in.

00:41:56.685 --> 00:41:57.130
Yeah.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.730
Boom, there it goes.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.480
Let's try that again.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.060
That was cool.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:07.050
So let's run 1,000 simulations
and one data point.

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.780
It bobbles around a little
bit and goes

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.640
flat over to the left.

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.630
Because that is the model that
reflects the one that the data

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.480
is generated from.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.150
So now we got Bayesian
classification, except now the

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.790
classification has gone one
step more and it becomes

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.440
structure discovery.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.700
We've got two choices
of structure.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.660
And we can use this Bayesian
thing to decide which of the

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.060
two structures is best.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.150
Isn't that cool?

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.230
Well, it's only cool if
you could do what?

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:42.710
So if you had two choices--

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.210
you can select between them
and pick the best one--

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.490
but there are--

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:51.120
gosh, for this number of
variables, there are a whole

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:55.540
lot of different networks that
satisfy the no looping

00:42:55.540 --> 00:43:00.952
criteria and don't have
very many parents.

00:43:00.952 --> 00:43:02.770
There's an awful lot of them.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.450
In fact, if you strict this
network to two parents there

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.260
are probably thousands and
thousands of possible

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.590
structures.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.840
So do I try them all?

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.340
Probably not.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.370
It's too much work when you
get 30 variables or

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.320
something like that.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.450
So what do you do?

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:21.740
We know what to do, right?

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.390
We're almost veterans a 6034.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:25.750
We have to search!

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:30.270
So what we do is we take the
loser and we modified it.

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.320
And then we modify it again.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:38.120
And we keep modifying it until
we drop dead or we get

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.450
something that we're
happy with.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.480
So let's see what happens if
we change this problem a

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.030
little bit and do structure
discover.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.740
We're starting out with
nothing linked.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.380
And we're going to just start
running this guy.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.600
So what's going to happen
is that the

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.690
good guy will prevail.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.990
And the bad guy will be
a copy of the good guy

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:57.150
perturbed in some way.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.280
So it's a random search.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.380
You'll notice that score--

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.170
it's too small for
you to read.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:04.460
All these things are
too small to read.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.710
Let me make it a
little bigger.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.130
Too small to read, but that
number on the right there is

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.240
not the product of the
probabilities, actually.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.850
It's the sum of the logarithms
of the probabilities.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.780
They go together, right?

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.440
And the reason you use this
instead of the probabilities

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:27.590
is because these numbers get
so small that was a 32-bit

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:29.740
machine, you eventually lose.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.730
So use the log of the
probabilities rather than the

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:35.630
product of the probabilities.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.660
You use the sum of the logs
instead of the product of the

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.840
probabilities.

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.210
And eventually, you hope that
this thing converges on the

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.760
correct interpretation.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.470
But you know what?

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:50.900
This thing is so flat as a space
and so a large and so

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:56.490
telephone pole-like that it's
full of local maxima.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:00.670
So what this program is doing
is every once in awhile--

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.880
I think with probability
1 and 10; I forgot what

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.883
parameters I used--

00:45:03.883 --> 00:45:08.410
every once in awhile, it'll do
a total radical rearrangement

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:09.150
of the structures.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.830
In other words, it's
a random restart.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:13.820
It keeps track of the
best guy so far.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.370
And every once in awhile it does
a totally random restart

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.870
in its effort to search
the space.

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:23.130
So that's how you go from
probabilistic inference to

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.300
structure discovery.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:29.560
Now when is this stuff
actually useful?

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.600
Well, I hinted at a medical
diagnosis, right?

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.890
That's a situation where you've
got some symptoms.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.160
And you want to know what
the disease is.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.470
So as soon as you use the
keyword "diagnosis," you've

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.840
got a problem for which this
stuff is a candidate.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.640
So what other kinds of diagnosis
problems are there?

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.360
Well, you might be
lying to me.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.350
So I can put a lie
detector on you.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.980
And each of those variables that
are measured by the lie

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.370
detector are an independent
indication whether you're

00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:59.910
telling the truth or not.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.300
So it's this kind of Bayesian
discovery thing.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.410
Naive Bayesian Classification.

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.972
What other kinds of
problems speak to

00:46:09.972 --> 00:46:11.130
the issue of diagnosis?

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.410
Well, we like to know how well
you know the material!

00:46:14.410 --> 00:46:19.110
So we can use quizzes as
pieces of evidence.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.590
Thank god we don't use exactly
a naive Bayesian classifier,

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:24.600
because then we wouldn't be able
to do that combination.

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.020
We have to use a slightly
more complex--

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.280
what you can think of as a
slightly more complex Bayesian

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:33.430
net to do that particular
kind of diagnosis.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.950
You might have a spacecraft or
an airplane or other piece of

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.950
equipment with all sorts
of symptoms.

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.530
You're trying to figure
out what to do next,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.100
what the cause is.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:46.210
So using the evidence to go
backward to the cause.

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.470
So maybe you've got some program
that doesn't work.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.390
Happens to me a lot.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.580
So I use the evidence from the
symptoms of the misbehavior to

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.480
figure out what the most
probable cause is.

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.020
But now to conclude the day--
last time there weren't any

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:03.890
powerful ideas.

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:08.090
But if you take the combination
of the last

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:14.170
lecture and this lecture to be
a candidate for gold star

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.740
ideas, these are the ones I'd
like to leave you with.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.750
We got here is--

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.420
this Bayesian stuff, all these
probabilistic calculations are

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:23.965
the right thing to do.

00:47:23.965 --> 00:47:30.270
They're the right way to work
when you don't know anything,

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.600
which would make it sound like
you're not very useful,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.890
because you think you always--
well, in fact, there are a lot

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:38.020
of situations where you either
can't know everything, don't

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.420
have time to know everything,
or don't want to take the

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.630
effort to know everything.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:47.190
So in medical diagnosis all
you've got is the symptoms.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.730
You can't go in there and figure
out in a more precise

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:50.750
way exactly what's wrong.

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.730
So you use the symptoms to
determine what the cause is.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.850
And then all those other kinds
of cases that I mentioned.

00:47:56.850 --> 00:48:00.520
But now, what other kinds of
structure discovery are there?

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.760
Well, the kind of structure
discovery that I hinted at in

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.550
the beginning will be the
subject that we'll begin with

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:10.330
during our next and sadly final
conversation here in

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.700
[? 10250 ?]

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.320
on Wednesday.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.210
It will feature not only a
discussion of how this stuff

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.890
can be used to discover patterns
and stories, but

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:24.590
we'll also talk about what's
on the final, what kind of

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:28.870
thing you could do next, that
sort of thing to finish off

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:29.420
the subject.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.710
And that's the end of
the story for today.
