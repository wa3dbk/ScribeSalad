00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.717
PROF.

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:12.460
PATRICK WINSTON: Well that's
the Kodo Drummers.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.290
They're a group of about 30 or
40 Japanese people who live in

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.880
a village on some island off
the coast of Japan, and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.690
preserve traditional
Japanese music.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.830
It's an unusual semi
communal group.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.500
They generally run about 10
kilometers before breakfast,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.730
which is served at 5:00 AM.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730
Strange group.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.460
Wouldn't miss a concert for
the world, although they,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.130
alas, don't seem to be
coming down to the

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.970
Boston area very soon.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.130
If you go to a concert
from the Kodo

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.480
Drummers--and you should--

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.880
and if you're no longer young,
you'll want to bring earplugs.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.490
Because, as we humans get
older the dynamic range

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.580
control in our inner ear tends
to be less effective.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.900
So that's why a person of my age
might find some piece of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.960
music excruciatingly loud,
whereas you'll

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.990
think it's just fine.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200
Because you have better
automatic gain control.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.470
Just like in any kind of
communication device there's a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.611
control on how intense
the sound gets.

00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:30.090
Ah, but I go off on a sidebar.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.310
Many of you have looked
at me in astonishment

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.622
as I drink my coffee.

00:01:37.622 --> 00:01:39.645
And you have undoubtedly have
been saying to yourself, you

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:42.960
know, Winston doesn't look like
a professional athlete,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.980
but he seemed to have no trouble
drinking his coffee.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.120
So today's material is going
to be pretty easy.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.080
So I want to give you the side
problem of thinking about how

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.830
it's possible for somebody
to do that.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.510
How is it possible?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.140
How would you make a computer
program that could reach out

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.850
and drink a cup of coffee, if
it wanted a cup of coffee?

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.370
So that's one puzzle I'd
like you to work on.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.030
There's another puzzle, too.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.660
And that puzzle concerns
diet drinks.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.070
This is a so-called Diet Coke.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.920
Yeah, it's ripe.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.120
If you take a Diet Coke and ask
yourself, what would a dog

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.900
think a Diet Coke is for?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.730
That's another puzzle that you
can work on while we go

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.800
through the material
of the day.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.150
So this is our first lecture
on learning, and I want to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.790
spend a minute or two in the
beginning talking about the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.990
lay of the land.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.190
And then we'll race through
some material on nearest

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.910
neighbor learning.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.850
And then we'll finish up
with the advertised

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.010
discussion of sleep.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.820
Because I know many of you think
that because your MIT

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.370
students you're pretty tough,
and you don't need

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.855
to sleep and stuff.

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:09.950
And we need to address that
question before it's too late

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.320
in the semester to get
back on track.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.730
All right.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.720
So here's the story.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.500
Now the way we're going
to look at learning is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.790
there are two kinds.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.780
There's this kind, and
there's that kind.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.640
And we're going to talk a little
bit about both kinds.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.340
The kind of the right is
learning based on observations

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.590
of regularity.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.190
And computers are particularly
good at this stuff.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.320
And amongst the things that
we'll talk about in connection

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.130
with regularity based learning
are today's topic, which is

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.380
nearest neighbors.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.520
Then a little bit downstream
we'll talk about neural nets.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.340
And then somewhere near the end
of the segment, we'll talk

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.900
about boosting.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.209
And these ideas come from
all over the place.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.590
In particular, the stuff we're
talking about today, nearest

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.010
neighbors, is the stuff of which
the field of pattern

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.260
recognition--

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.690
it's the stuff of which pattern
recognition journals

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.910
are filled.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.450
This stuff has been around
a long time.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.970
Does that mean it's not good?

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.850
I hope not, because that would
mean that everything you

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.060
learned in 1801 is not good,
because the same course was

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.980
taught 1910.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.950
So it has been around a while,
but it's extremely useful.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.980
And it's the first thing to try
when you have a learning

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.570
problem, because it's
the simplest thing.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.200
And you always want to try the
simplest thing before you try

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.480
something more complex that
you will be less likely to

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.280
understand.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.360
So that's nearest neighbors
and pattern recognitions.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.060
And the custodians of knowledge
about neural nets,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.090
well this is sort of an attempt
to mimic biology.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.370
And I'll cast a lot of calumny
on that when we get down there

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.000
to talk about it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And finally, this is the gift
of the theoreticians.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.550
So we in AI have invented some
stuff, we've borrowed some

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.400
stuff, we've stolen some stuff,
we've championed some

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.520
stuff, and we've improved
some stuff.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.210
That's why our discussion of
learning will reach around all

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.030
of these topics.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.410
So that's regularity
based learning.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.100
And you can think of
this as the branch

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.350
of bulldozer computing.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.750
Because, when doing these kinds
of things, a computer's

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.426
processing information like a
bulldozer processes gravel.

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:04.530
Now that's not necessarily a
good model for all the kinds

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.140
of learning that humans do.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.810
And after all, learning is one
of the things that we think

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.040
characterizes human
intelligence.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.310
So if we were to build models
of it and understand that we

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.800
have to go down this
other branch, too.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.530
And down this other branch we
find learning ideas that are

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.780
based on constraint.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.540
And let's call this the

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.140
human-like side of the picture.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.310
And we'll talk about ideas
that enable, for example,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.230
one-shot learning, where you
learn something definite from

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.530
each experience.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.300
And we'll talk about explanation
based learning.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:04.930
By the way, do you learn
by self explanation?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.430
I think so.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.220
I had an advisee once, who got
nothing but A's and F's.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.600
And I said, what are the
subjects that you get A's in?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.420
And why don't you get A's
in all of your subjects?

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.360
And he said, oh, I get A's in
the subjects when I convince

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.800
myself the material is true.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.060
So the learning was a byproduct
of self explanation,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.720
an important kind of learning.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.860
But alas, that's downstream.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.630
And what we're going to talk
about today is this path

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.650
through the tree, nearest
neighbor learning.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.280
And here's how it works,
in general.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:45.430
Here's just a general picture
of what we're talking about.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.130
When you think of pattern
recognition, or nearest

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.870
neighbor based learning,
you've got some sort of

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.940
mechanism that generates
a vector of features.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.475
So we'll call this the
feature detector.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.652
And out comes a vector
of values.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:09.090
And that vector of values
goes into a

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.685
comparator of some sort.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.240
And that comparator compares
the feature vector with

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.696
feature vectors coming from a
library of possibilities.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.440
And by finding the closest
match the comparator

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.460
determines what some
object is.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.710
It does recognition.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.870
So let me demonstrate that with
these electrical covers.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:53.580
Suppose they arrived on an
assembly line and some robot

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.820
wants to sort them.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.830
How would it go about
doing that?

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.080
Well it could easily
use the nearest

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.240
neighbor sorting mechanism.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.440
So how would that work?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.690
Well here's how if would work.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.490
You would make some
measurements.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.310
And it we'll just make some
measurements in two

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.950
dimensions.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:17.030
And one of those measurements
might be the total area,

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.780
including the area
of the holes of

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.440
these electrical covers.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.430
Just so you can follow what I'm
doing without craning your

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.102
neck, let me see if I can find
the electrical covers.

00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:29.040
Yes, there they are.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.080
So we've got one big blank
one, and several others.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.920
So we might also measure
the hole area.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.320
And this one here, this guy
here, this big white one has

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.910
no hole area, and its got the
maximum amount of total area.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.410
So it will find itself
at that point in

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.590
this space of features.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:02.710
Then we've got the guy
here, with room for

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.330
four sockets in it.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.980
That's got the maximum amount
of hole area, as well as the

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.360
maximum amount of area.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.180
So it will be right straight
up, maybe up here.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:20.230
Then we have, in addition to
those two, a blank cover, like

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:24.670
this, that's got about 1/2 the
total area that any cover can

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.710
have, so we'll put
it right here.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.560
And finally, we've got one
more of these guys.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.590
Oh yes, this one.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.580
1/2 the hole area, and
1/2 the total area.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.680
So I don't know, let's see.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.370
Where will that go?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.400
Maybe about right here.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.330
So now our robot is looking on
the assembly line and it sees

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.570
something coming along, and
it measures the area.

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.320
And of course, there's noise.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.840
There's manufacturing
variability.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.960
So it won't be precisely
on top of anything.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.090
But suppose it's right there.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.820
Well it doesn't take any
genius human, human or

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.360
computer, to figure out that
this must be one of those guys

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.230
with maximum area and
maximum hole area.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.880
But now let's ask some
other questions.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:21.595
Where would
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD], what

00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:23.460
would that be?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.780
Or what would this be?

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.570
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD],
and so on.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:34.980
Well we have to figure out
what those newly viewed

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.162
objects are closest to in order
to do an identification.

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:40.350
But that's easy.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:46.050
We just calculate the distance
to all of those standard,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.980
platonic, ideal descriptions
of things, and we find out

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.790
which is nearest.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.610
But in general, it's a little
easier to think about

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:01.580
producing some boundaries
between these various idealize

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.530
places, so that we can just
say, well which area

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.540
is the object in?

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.900
And then we'll know
instantaneously to what

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.250
category it belongs.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.140
So if we only had two, like the
purple one and the yellow

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.880
one, it would be easy.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.520
Because, we would just construct
a line between the

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.290
two, with a line between the
purple and yellow as a

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.390
perpendicular bisector.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.550
And so drawing it out instead of
talking about it, if there

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.270
were only two, that would
be the boundary line.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.270
Anything south of the dotted
line would be purple, and

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.180
anything north would
be yellow.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.570
And now we can do this with
all the points, right?

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.350
So we can figure out-- oh could
you, Pierre, could you

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.800
just close the lap top please?

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.620
So if we want to do this with
all these guys it would go

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.390
something like this--

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.450
I better get rid of these
dotted x's before

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.600
they confuse me.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.930
Let's see, if these were the
only two points, then we would

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.460
want to construct a
perpendicular bisector between

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.762
the line joining them.

00:13:09.762 --> 00:13:13.860
And if these two were the only
points, I would want to

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.060
construct this perpendicular
bisector.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.520
And if these two were the only
points, I would want to

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.100
construct a perpendicular
bisector.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.180
And if these two points were
the only ones involved I'd

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.960
want to construct--

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.480
oh, you see what I'm doing?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.410
I'm constructing perpendicular
bisectors, and those are

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:38.520
exactly the lines that
I need in order to

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.530
divide up this space.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.070
And it's going to divide
up like this.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.230
And I won't say we'll give you
a problem like this on an

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.630
examination, but we have every
year in the past ten.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.310
To divide up a space
and produce--

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.730
something we would like
to give a name.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.010
You know, Rumpelstiltskin
effect, when you have a name

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.390
you get power over it.

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.865
So we're going to call these
decision boundaries.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.760
OK so those are the simple
decision boundaries, produced

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:21.050
in a sample space,
by a simple idea.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.030
But there is a little bit
more to say about this.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:29.450
Because, I've talked about this
as if we're trying to

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.510
identify something.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.560
There's another way of thinking
about it that's

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.500
extremely important.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.180
And that is this.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:43.340
Suppose I come in with a brand
new cover, never before seen.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:52.780
And I only measure, well
let's say I only

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.710
measure the hole area.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.695
And the hole area
has that value.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.600
What is the most likely
total area?

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.060
Well I don't know.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.290
But there's a kind of weak
principle of, if something is

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.250
similar in some respects,
it's likely to be

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.175
similar in other respects.

00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:19.100
So I'm going to guess, if you
hold a knife to my throat and

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.090
back me into a corner, that it's
total area is going to be

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:27.410
something like that orange
cover whole, total area.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.340
So this is a contrived example,
and I don't make too

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:29.800
much of it.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.910
But I do want to make
a lot of that first

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.630
principal, over there.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.200
And that is the idea that, if
something is similar in some

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.740
respects, it's likely to be
similar in other respects.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:45.120
Because that's what most
of education is about.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.990
Fairy tales, legal
cases, medical

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.760
cases, business cases--

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.170
if you can see that there are
similar in some respects to a

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.070
situation you've got now, then
it's likely that they're going

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.860
to be similar in other
respects, as well.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.115
So when we're learning, we're
not just learning to recognize

00:16:00.115 --> 00:16:02.740
a category, we're learning
because we're attempting to

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.390
apply some kind of precedent.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.996
That's the story on that.

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:11.590
Well that's a simple idea but
does it have any application?

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.810
The answer is sure.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.470
Here's an example.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.730
My second example, the example
of cell identification.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.060
Suppose you have some
white blood cells,

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.310
what might you do?

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.960
You might measure the total
area of the cell.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.340
And not the hole area, but
maybe the nucleus area.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.685
And maybe you might measure four
or five other things, and

00:16:36.685 --> 00:16:38.300
put this thing in a high
dimensional space.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.860
You can still measure
the nearness in a

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.700
high dimensional space.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.020
So you can use the
idea to do that.

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:45.780
It works pretty well.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.940
A friend of mine once started a
company based on this idea.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.490
He got wiped out, of course,
but it wasn't his fault.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.670
What happened is that somebody
invented a better stain and it

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.670
became much easier
to just do the

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:00.030
recognition by brute force.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.840
So let's see, that's
two examples.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.770
the introductory example of the
holes of the electrical

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.810
covers, and the example
of cells.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:14.170
And what I want to do now is
show you how the idea can

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.940
reappear in disguised forms in
areas where you might not

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.010
expect to see it.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.310
So consider the following
problem.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:29.070
You have a collection of
articles from magazines.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.060
And you're interested in
learning something about how

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.920
to address a particular
question.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.510
How do you go about finding the
articles that are relevant

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.420
to your question?

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:46.170
So this is a puzzle that has
been studied for decades by

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.900
people interested in information
retrieval.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.390
And here's the simple
way to do it.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:59.010
I'm going to illustrate, once
again, in just two dimensions.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.840
But it has to be applied in
many, many dimensions.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.930
The idea is you count up the
words in the articles in your

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:12.370
library, and you compare the
word counts to the word counts

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.870
in your probing question.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.480
So you might be interested
in 100 words.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.990
I'm only going to write two on
the board for illustration.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:29.850
So we're going to think about
articles from two magazines.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.500
Well first of all, what words
are we going to use?

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:38.160
One word is going to be hack,
and that will include all

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.550
derivatives of hack-- hacker,
hacking, and so on.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.550
And the other word is going
to be computer.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.250
And so it would not be
surprising for you to see that

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.480
articles from Wired Magazine
might appear

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.790
in places like this.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.320
They would involve lots of uses
of the word computer, and

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.670
lots of uses of the word hack.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.180
And now for the sake of
illustration, the second

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:11.680
magazine from which we are going
to draw articles is Town

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.700
and Country.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:17.830
It's a very tony magazine, and
the people who read out Town

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.360
and Country tend to be
social parasites.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.930
And they still use
the word hack.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.330
Because you can talk about
hacking, there's some sort of

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.080
specialize term of art in
dealing with horses.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.760
So all the Town and Country
articles would be likely to be

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.980
down here somewhere.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:46.110
And maybe they would be one like
that when they talk about

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.960
hiring some computer expert to
keep track of the results so

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.940
the weekly hunt, or something.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.950
And now, in you come
with your probe.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.430
And of course your probe
question is going to be

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.220
relatively small.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.510
It's not going to have
a lot of words in it.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.640
So here's your here's
your probe question.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.890
Here's your unknown.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:13.840
Which article's going
to be closest?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.944
Which articles are going
to be closest?

00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:22.580
Well, alas, all those Town and
Country articles are closest.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:27.520
So you can't use the nearest
neighbor idea, it would seem.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.230
Anybody got a suggestion
for how we might

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.570
get out of this dilemma?

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:31.286
Yes, Christopher.

00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:35.087
CHRISTOPHER: If you're looking
for word counts and you want

00:20:35.087 --> 00:20:38.248
to include some terms of
computer, then wouldn't you

00:20:38.248 --> 00:20:40.743
want to use that as a threshold,
rather than the

00:20:40.743 --> 00:20:41.741
nearest neighbor?

00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:41.824
PROF.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:42.740
PATRICK WINSTON: I don't
know, it's a good idea.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.492
It might work, who knows.

00:20:46.492 --> 00:20:47.486
Doug?

00:20:47.486 --> 00:20:50.965
DOUG: Instead of using decision
boundaries that are

00:20:50.965 --> 00:20:55.530
perpendicular bisectors, if you
treated Wired and Town and

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:59.434
Country as sort of this
like, [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:00.410
targets.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.338
And they would look like some
[? great radial ?], here.

00:21:03.338 --> 00:21:05.290
I guess, some radius
around curves.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.730
If it's within a certain
radius then--

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:13.098

[? SPEAKER 1: Are we, ?]
necessarily, have it done with

metric.

00:21:19.602 --> 00:21:21.066
We're going to use some
other metric.

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:22.042

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.880
Let me give you a hint.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.720
There are all those articles up
there, out there, and out

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.045
there, just for example.

00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:41.060
And here are the Town and
Country articles.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.210
They're out there, and out
there, for example.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.050
And now our unknown
is out there.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.020
Anybody got an idea now?

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.110
Hey Brett, what do you think?

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.870
BRETT: So you sort of
want the ratio.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.640
Or in this case, you can
take the angle--

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:58.707
PROF.

00:21:58.707 --> 00:22:00.270
PATRICK WINSTON: Let's be-- ah,
there we go, we're getting

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.060
a little more sophisticated.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.320
The angle between what?

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.260
BRETT: The angle between
the vectors.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:05.381
PROF.

00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:06.715
PATRICK WINSTON: The vectors.

00:22:06.715 --> 00:22:08.170
Good.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.140
So we're going to use
a different metric.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.485
What we're going to do is,
we're going to forget

00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:12.810
including a distance, and we're
going to measure the

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.150
angle between the vectors.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.460
So the angle between the
vectors, well let's actually

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.960
measure the cosine of the angle
between the vectors.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.180
Let's see how we can
calculate that.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.970
So we'll take the cosine of the
angle between the vectors,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.570
we'll call it theta.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:37.960
That's going to be equal to the
sum of the unknown values

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.660
times the article values.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.290
Those are just the values
in various dimensions.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.660
And then we'll divide that
by the magnitude

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.550
of the other vectors.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.430
So we'll divide by the magnitude
of u, and we'll

00:22:54.430 --> 00:23:00.290
divide by the magnitude of the
art vector to the article.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.050
So that's just the dot
product right?

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.860
That's a very fast
computation.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.075
So with a very fast computation
you can see if

00:23:08.075 --> 00:23:10.250
these things are going to be
in the same direction.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:15.670
By the way, if this vector here
is actually identical to

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.980
one of those articles, what
will the value be?

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.366
Well then a cosine will be 0 and
we'll get the maximum die

00:23:22.366 --> 00:23:23.616
of the cosine, which is 1.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.540
Yeah, that will do it.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.900
So if we use any of the articles
to probe the article

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.230
space, they'll find themselves,
which is a good

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.080
thing to have a mechanism do.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:43.560
OK.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.300
So that's just the dot product
of those two vectors.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.220
And it works like a charm.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.830
It's not the most sophisticated
way of doing

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.620
these things.

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.150
There are hairy ways.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.370
You can get a Ph.D. by doing
this sort of stuff in some new

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.510
and sophisticated way.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.230
But this is a simple way.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.830
It works pretty well.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.080
And you don't have to strain
yourself, much,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.990
to implement it.

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.700
So that's cool.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.220
That's an example where
we have a very

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:08.470
non-standard metric.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.190
Now let's see, what
else can we do?

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.980
How about a robotic
arm control?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.430
Here we go.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.790
We're going to just
have a simple arm.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.820
And what we want to do is, we
want to get this arm to move

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:43.200
that ball along some trajectory
at a speed,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.040
velocity, and acceleration
that we have determined.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.320
So we've got two
problems here.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.780
Well let's see, we've got two
problems because, first of

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:59.374
all, we've got angles,
theta 1 and theta 2.

00:24:59.374 --> 00:25:04.470
It's a 2 degree of 3 of arm, so
there are only two angles.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.220
So the first problem we have
is the kinematic problem of

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.590
translating the (x,y)-cordinates
of the ball,

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.660
the desired ones, into the
theta 1, theta 2 space.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.630
That's simple kinematic
problem.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:16.680
No f equals ma there.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.110
It Doesn't involve forces,
or time, or

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.240
acceleration, anything.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.680
Pretty simple.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:31.990
But then we've got the problem
of getting it to go along that

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:36.690
trajectory with positions,
speeds, and

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.230
accelerations that we desire.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:48.710
And now you say to me, well I've
got 801, I can do that.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.920
And that's true, you can.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.480
Because, it's Newtonian
mechanics.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.810
All you have to do is
solve the equations.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:06.810
There are the equations.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.060
Good luck.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.940
Why are they so complicated?

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.655
Well because of the complicated
geometry.

00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:18.850
You notice we've got some
products of theta 1 and theta

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.170
2 in there, somewhere,
I think?

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.210
You've got theta 2's.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.570
I see an acceleration squared.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.080
And yeah, there's a theta 1
dot times a theta 2 dot.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.520
A velocity times a velocity.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.530
Where the hell did
that come from?

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.970
I mean it's supposed to
be f equals ma, right?

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.600
Those are Coriolis forces,
because of

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.690
the complicated geometry.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:37.950
OK.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.440
So you hire Berthold Horn, or
somebody, to work these

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.210
equations out for you.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.590
And he comes up with something
like this.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.090
And you try it out and
it doesn't work.

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:46.175
Why doesn't it work?

00:26:46.175 --> 00:26:47.772
It's Newtonian mechanics,
I said.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.480
It doesn't work because we
forgot to tell Berthold that

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.860
there's friction in
all the joints.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.800
And we forgot to tell him that
they've worn a little bit

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.470
since yesterday.

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.150
And we forgot that the
measurements we make on the

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.500
lab table are not
quite precise.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.580
So people try to do this.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.360
It just doesn't work.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.270
As soon as you get a ball of a
different weight you have to

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:11.820
start over.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.310
It's gross.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.560
So I don't know.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.990
I can do this sort of thing
effortlessly, and I couldn't

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.590
begin to solve those
equations.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.410
So let's see.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.940
What we're going to do is we're
going to forget about

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.310
the problem for a minute.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.030
And we're going to talk
about building

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.180
ourselves a gigantic table.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.570
And here's what's going
to be on the table.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.610
Theta 1, theta 2, theta 3,
oops, there are only two.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.960
So that's theta 1 again,
but it's the

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.260
velocity, angular velocity.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.570
And then we have the
accelerations.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.685
So we're going to have a big
table of these things.

00:27:56.685 --> 00:27:58.780
And what we're going to
do, is we're going to

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.140
give this arm a childhood.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.270
And we're going to write down
all the combinations we ever

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.940
see, every 100 milliseconds,
or something.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.947
And the arm is just going to
wave around like a kid does in

00:28:10.947 --> 00:28:13.160
the cradle.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.350
And then, we're not
quite done.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.660
Because there are two other
things we're going to record.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.410
Can you guess what they are?

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.317
There are going to be the torque
on the first motor, and

00:28:24.317 --> 00:28:25.839
the torque on the
second motor.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.710
And so now, we've got a whole
bunch of those records.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.960
The question is, what do
we got to do with it?

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.620
Well here's what we're
going to do it.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.200
We're going to divide this
trajectory that we're hoping

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:49.370
to achieve, up into
little pieces.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:50.580
And there's a little piece.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.860
And in that little
piece nothing is

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.420
going to change much.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.960
There's going to be an

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.770
acceleration, velocity, position.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:02.000
And so we can look those
up in the table that

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.892
we made in the childhood.

00:29:03.892 --> 00:29:08.360
And we'll look around and find
the closest match, and this

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.960
will be the set of values for
the positions, velocities, and

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:17.230
accelerations that are
associated with that

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.880
particular movement.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.200
And guess what we can do now?

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.460
We can say, in the past, the
torques associated with that

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.650
particular little piece of
movement lie right there.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.950
So we can just look it up.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.690
Now this method was thought
up and rejected, because

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.690
computers weren't
powerful enough.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.170
And then, this is the age
of recycling, right?

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.625
So the idea got recycled when
computers got strong enough.

00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:46.336
And it works pretty well,
for things like this.

00:29:46.336 --> 00:29:51.040
But you might say to me, well
can it do the stuff that we

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.620
humans can do, like this?

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.010
And the answer is, let's look.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.820
So this is a training
phase, it's

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.070
going through its childhood.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.940
You see what's happening
is this.

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.200
The initial table won't
be very good.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.330
But that's OK.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.950
Because there are only a small
number of things that it's

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.600
important for you to
be able to do.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.450
So when you try those
things it's still

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.340
writing into the table.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.660
So the next time you try that
particular motion, it's going

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.800
to be better at it, because
its got better stuff to

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:02.810
interpolate [? amongst ?]

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.300
in that table.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.290
So that's why this thing is
getting better and better as

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.540
it goes on.

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.500
That's as good as I was doing.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:38.830
Pretty good, don't you think?

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.460
There's just one thing I want
to show at the end of this

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.820
clip just for fun.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.470
Maybe you've seen some
old Zorro movies?

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.370
So here's a little set up where
this thing has learned

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:56.680
to use a lash.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.220
So here's the lash, and there's
a candle down there.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.470
So watch this.

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:13.160
Pretty good, don't you think?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.840
So how fast does the learning
take place?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.820
Let me go back to that other
slides and show you.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:24.790
So here's some graphs to show
you how fast goes, boom.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.620
That gives you the curves of how
well the robot arm can go

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.290
along a straight line, after
no practice with just some

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.200
stuff recorded in the memory.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.270
And then with a couple of
practice runs do give it

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:40.120
better values amongst which
to interpolate.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.170
So I think that's pretty cool.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.630
So simple, but yet
so effective.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.720
But you still might say, well,
I don't know, it might be

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.280
something that can be done
in special cases.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.230
I wonder if old Winston uses
something like that when he

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.470
drinks his coffee?

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.610
Well we' ought to
do the numbers

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:01.050
and see if it's possible.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.190
But I don't want to
use coffee, it's

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.740
the baseball season.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.180
We're approaching the
World Series.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.410
We might as well talk about
professional athletes.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:18.320
So let's suppose that this
is a baseball pitcher.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.620
And I want to know how much
memory I'll need to record a

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.590
whole lot of pitches.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.040
Is there a good pitcher
these days?

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:27.710
The Red Socks suck so I
don't do Red Socks.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.240
Clay Buchholz, I guess.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.560
I don't know, some pitcher.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.380
And what we're going to do, is
we're going to say for each of

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.890
these little segments
were going to record

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:46.990
100 bytes per joint.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.980
And we've got joints
all over the place.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.230
I don't know how many are
involved in doing a baseball

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:58.170
pitch, but let's just say
we have had 100 joints.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.840
And then we have to divide
the pitch up

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.800
into a bunch of segments.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.470
So let's just say for sake
of argument that

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:15.219
there are 100 segments.

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:20.560
And how many pitches does a
pitcher throw in a day?

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:20.879
What?

00:34:20.879 --> 00:34:21.675
SPEAKER 2: In a day?

00:34:21.675 --> 00:34:21.754
PROF.

00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:25.010
PATRICK WINSTON:
In a day, yeah.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.330
This, we all know,
is about 100.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.610
Everybody knows that
they take them out

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:37.210
after about 100 pitches.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.330
So what I want to know is how
much memory we need to record

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.000
all the pitches a pitcher
pitches in his career.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.060
So we still have to work on
this little bit more.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.000
How many days a year does
a pitcher pitch?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.750
Well, they've got winter ball,
and that sort of thing, so

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:56.938
let's just approximate
it as 100.

00:34:56.938 --> 00:34:59.070
I don't know, some of these may
be a little high, some of

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.430
the others may be a low.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.650
And of course, the career--

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.524
just to make things easy--

00:35:04.524 --> 00:35:07.940
is 100 years.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.000
So that's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.110
So we have 10 to
the 12th bytes.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.340
Is that the hopelessly
big to store in here?

00:35:21.184 --> 00:35:23.080
CHRISTOPHER: 10 to 100
[INAUDIBLE] or

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.460
just 100 times throwing?

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:25.495
PROF.

00:35:25.495 --> 00:35:27.470
PATRICK WINSTON: 100
pitches in a day--

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:28.860
Christopher's asking
some detail--

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:30.790
and what we're gong to do
is we're going to record

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.270
everything there is to know
about one pitch, and then

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.472
we're going to see how
many pitches, he

00:35:34.472 --> 00:35:35.890
pitches in his lifetime.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.140
And we're going to
record all that.

00:35:41.516 --> 00:35:42.444
Trust me.

00:35:42.444 --> 00:35:43.805
Trust me.

00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:47.800
OK. so we want to know if this
is actually a practical scale.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.640
And this, by the way, is
cocktail conversation, who

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.330
knows, right?

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:53.170
But it's useful to work out
these numbers, and know some

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:54.780
of these numbers.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.690
So the question we have
to ask is, how much

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.010
computation is in there?

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.240
And the first question relevant
to that is, how many

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.760
neurons do we have
in our brain?

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.650
Volunteer?

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.740
Neuroscience?

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.580
No one to volunteer?

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:15.970
All right.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.690
Well this is a number you should
know, because this is

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.990
what you've got in there.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:29.870
There are 10 to the 10th neurons
in the brain, of which

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.990
10 to the 11th are in the
cerebellum, alone.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.670
What the devil do
I mean by that?

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.390
I mean that your cerebellum is
so full of neurons that it

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:44.610
dwarfs the rest of the brain.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.440
So if you exclude the
cerebellum, you've got about

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.380
10 to 10th neurons.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.020
And there about 10 to
the 11th neurons in

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.750
the cerebellum, alone.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:53.610
What's the cerebellum for?

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.210
Motor control.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.380
Interesting.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.690
So we're a little short.

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.170
Oh, but we forget, that's just
the number of neurons.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.630
We have to count up the
number of synapses.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.060
Because conceivably, we might
be able to adjust those

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.650
synapses, right?

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.670
So how many synapses
does a neuron have?

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.020
The answer is, it depends.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.855
But the ones in the
cerebellum--

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.990
I should be pointing back
there, I guess--

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.550
10 to the 5th.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:31.970
So if we add all that up
we have 10 to the 16th.

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.220
No problem.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.950
It's just that existence proves
that you don't have to

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.470
worry too much about
having storage.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:44.100
So maybe our cerebellum
functions, in some way, as a

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.150
gigantic table.

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:49.240
And that's maybe how we learn
motor skills, by filling up

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:55.700
that table as we run around
emerging from the cradle,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.770
learning how to manipulate
ourselves as we go on.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:05.440
So that's the story
on arm control.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:11.320
Now all this is pretty
straightforward, easy to

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.430
understand.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.515
And of course, there
are some problems.

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:34.660
Problem number one, what
if the space of

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.586
samples looks like this?

00:38:36.586 --> 00:38:42.420
[TAPPING ON CHALK BOARD]

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:45.400
What's going to happen
in that case?

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.870
Well what's going to happen
in that case is that the--

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.595
let's see, which values are
going to be more important?

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.160
The x values, right?

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.000
The y values are spread out
all over the place.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.470
So you'd like the spread of
the data to sort of be the

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:06.820
same in all the dimensions.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.650
So is there anything we
can do to arrange

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:10.710
for that to be true?

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.820
Sure, we can just normalize
the data.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.470
So we can borrow from our
statistics course and say,

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.040
well, let's see, we're
interested in x.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:27.250
And we know that the variance
of x is equal to 1 over n

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:35.170
times the sum of the values,
minus the mean value squared.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:39.090
That's a measure of how much
the data spreads out.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:43.990
So now, instead of using x, we
can use x prime, which is

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:51.380
equal to x over sigma.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.120
What's the variance of
that going to be?

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.000
x over sigma sub x.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.820
Anybody see, instantaneously,
what the variance of

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.630
that's going be?

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.980
Or do we have to work it out?

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.250
It's going to be 1, Work
out the algebra for me.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.470
It's obvious, it's simple.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:17.150
Just substitute x prime into
this formula for variance, and

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.545
do the algebraic high
school manipulation.

00:40:18.545 --> 00:40:20.720
And you'll see that the variance
turns out not to be

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.750
of this new variable, this
transformed variable you want.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:30.100
So that problem, the non
uniformity problem, the spread

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.920
problem, is easy to handle.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.260
What about that other problem?

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.090
No cake without flour?

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:56.050
What if it turns out
that the data--

00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.470
you have two dimensions and the
answer, actually, doesn't

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.250
depend on y at all.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.500
What will happen?

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.680
Then you're often going to get
screwy results, because it'll

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.450
be measuring a distance
that is merely

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.510
confusing the answer.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.160
So problem number two is the
what matters problem.

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:32.618
Write it down, what matters.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.440
Problem number three is, what
if the answer doesn't depend

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.540
on the data at all?

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.360
Then you've got the trying to
build a cake without flour.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.430
Once somebody asked me--

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.030
a classmate of mine, who went
on to become an important

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.210
executive in an important credit
card company-- asked me

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:58.780
if we could use artificial
intelligence to determine when

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.280
somebody was going
to go bankrupt?

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.220
And the answer was, no.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:07.930
Because the data available was
data that was independent of

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:08.990
that question.

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.100
So he was trying to make a cake
without flour, and you

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.210
can't do that.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:14.300
So that concludes what
I want to say

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.040
about nearest neighbors.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.750
No I want to talk a little
bit about sleep.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:22.010
Over there on that left-side
branch, now disappeared, we

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.750
talked about the human
side of learning.

00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.250
And I said something
about one-shot, an

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.390
escalation based learning.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.110
And what that means is,
you don't learn

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:37.000
without problem solving.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.950
And the question is, how is
problem solving related to how

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.910
much sleep you get?

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:44.330
And to answer questions like
that, of course, you want to

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.420
go to the people who are the
custodians of the kind of

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.870
knowledge you are
interested in.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.980
And so you would say, who are
the custodians of knowledge

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.690
about how much sleep you need?

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.910
And what happens if
you don't get it?

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:58.020
And the answer is the
United States Army.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.170
Because they're extremely
interested in what happens

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.516
when you cross 10 or 12 times
zones, and have no sleep, and

00:43:04.516 --> 00:43:06.600
have to perform.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.090
So they're very interested
in that question.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.730
And they got even more
interested after the first

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:12.720
Gulf War, which was the
most studied war in

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.890
history, up to that time.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.750
Because, there were after action
reports they were full

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.490
of examples like this.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:26.750
The US Forces, in a certain part
of the battlefield, and

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:27.680
drawn up for the night.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:31.040
And those are Bradley fighting
vehicles, there, and back here

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.430
Abrams tanks.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.770
And they're all just kind
of settling down for

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.760
good night's sleep.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.110
They've been up for about 36
hours straight, by the way.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:48.940
When, much to their amazement,
across their field-of-view

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.720
came a column of
Iraqi vehicles.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.240
And both sides were enormously
surprised.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.830
A firefight broke out.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.600
The lead vehicle, over
here, on the Iraqi

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.970
side caught on fire.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:08.110
So these guys, in the Bradley
fighting vehicles, went around

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:12.370
to investigate, whereupon, these
guys started blasting

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:17.590
away, in acts of fratricidal
fire.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:23.450
And the interesting thing is
that all these folks here

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:26.160
swore in the after action
reports that they were firing

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.430
straight ahead.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.330
And what happened was their
ability to put ordnance on

00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:33.205
target was not impaired
at all.

00:44:33.205 --> 00:44:36.090
But their idea of where the
target was, what the target

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:40.100
was, whether it was a target,
was all screwed up.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.950
So this led to a lot of
experiments in which people

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.810
were sleep deprived.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.150
And by the way, you think
you're a tough

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.020
MIT student, right?

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.500
These are Army Rangers.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.850
It doesn't get any tougher
than this, believe me.

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:52.780
So here's one of the

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.290
experiments that was performed.

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.740
In those days they had
what they called

00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.110
fire control teams.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.820
And their job is to take
information from an observer,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:08.780
over here, about a target,
over here.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:18.880
And tell the artillery, over
here, where to fire.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.170
So they kept some of
these folks up

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.020
for 36 hours straight.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.780
And after 36 hours they all
said, we're doing great.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.620
And at that time they were
bringing fire down on

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:35.360
hospitals, mosques, churches,
schools, and themselves.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.500
Because, they couldn't do the
calculations anymore, after 36

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.310
hours without sleep.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:44.430
And now you say to me, well I'm
a MIT student, I want to

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.070
see the data.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.390
So let's have a look
at the data.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.180
OK.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.090
So there it goes.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:11.730
That's what happens to you after
72 hours without sleep.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.000
These are simple things to do.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.910
Very simple calculations you
have to do in your head, like

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:21.730
adding numbers, spelling words,
and things like that.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.400
So after 72 hours without
sleep, your performance

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:30.860
relative to what you were at
the beginning is about 30%.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.825
So loss of sleep destroys
ability.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:48.900
[BELL RINGING]

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.390
Sleep loss accumulates.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:52.830
So you say, well I need
eight hours of sleep--

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:55.145
and what you need, by
the way, varies--

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:58.220
but I'm going to get by was
seven hours of sleep.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:02.830
So after 20 days of one hour's
worth of sleep deprivation,

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:05.740
you're down about 25%.

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:09.660
If you say, well I need eight
hours of sleep, but I'm going

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.470
to have to get by with just six,
after 20 days of that,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:19.450
you're down to about 25% of
your original capability.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.390
So you might say, well
does caffeine help?

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.950
Or naps, naps in this case.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.300
And the answer is, yes,
a little bit.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:29.790
Some people argue that you get
the more affect out of the

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.620
sleep that you do get if
you divide it into two.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.640
Winston Churchill always
took a three

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.580
hour nap in the afternoon.

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.080
He said that way he got a day
and a half's worth of work out

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.740
of every day.

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.930
He got the full amount
of sleep.

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.630
But he divided it
into two pieces.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:44.140
Here's the caffeine one.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.430
So caffeine does help.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:52.680
And now you say, well, shoot,
I think I'm going to take it

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.710
kind of easy this semester.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.100
And I'll just work hard during
the week before finals.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.550
Maybe I won't even bother
sleeping for the 24 hours

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.754
before the 6034 final.

00:48:04.754 --> 00:48:05.920
That's OK.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.170
Well let's see what
will happen.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.930
So let's work the numbers.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.240
Here is 24 hours.

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.260
And that's where your

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:18.370
effectiveness is after 24 hours.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.710
Now let's go over to the same
amount of effectiveness on the

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.910
blood alcohol curve.

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.290
And it's about the level
at which you

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:28.880
would be legally drunk.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.370
So I guess what we ought to do
is to check everybody as they

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.040
come in for the 6034 final, and
arrest you if you've been

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.970
24 hours without sleep.

00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.850
And not let you take any finals
again, for a year.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:46.710
So if you do all that, you
might as well get drunk.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.400
And now we have one thing
left to do today.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.720
And that is address the original
question of, why it

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:54.520
is that the dogs and cats in the
world think that the diet

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.400
drink makes people fat?

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.600
What's the answer?

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.160
It's because only fat guys
like me drink this crap.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:08.580
So since the dogs and cats don't
have the ability to tell

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.430
themselves stories, don't have
that capacity to string

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:14.870
together events into narratives,
they don't have

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.230
any way of saying, well this is
a consequence of desiring

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.110
not to be fat.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:21.870
Not a consequence
of being fat.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.970
They don't have that story.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.810
And so what they're doing is
something you have to be very

00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:26.450
careful about.

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:28.630
And that thing you have to be
very careful about is the

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.930
confusion of correlation
with cause.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.040
They see the correlation, but
they don't understand the

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.660
cause, so that's why they
make a mistake.
