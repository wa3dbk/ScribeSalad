00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.300
PATRICK WINSTON: Ladies and
gentlemen, the Romanian

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.960
national anthem.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.930
I did not ask you to stand,
because I didn't play it as a

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.250
symbol of Romanian national
identity.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.580
But rather, to celebrate the
end of the Cold War, which

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.740
occurred about the time
that you were born.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.980
Before that, no one came to
MIT from Eastern Europe.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.070
But since that time, we've been
blessed by having in our

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:40.850
midst Lithuanians, Estonians,
Poles, Czecs, Slovaks,

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.400
Bulgarians, Romanians,
Slovenians, Serbs, and all

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.510
sorts of people from regions
of the world

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.580
formally excluded to us.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.900
Believe me, you are all
welcome in our house.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.110
Almost all, that is to say.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.530
Because you may recall that
Romania is the traditional

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.430
home of vampires.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.180
And since the end of the Cold
War, vampires have had new

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.360
vectors for emerging from their
traditional places and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.010
penetrating into the
world at large.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.560
You may have vampire in your
suite, or on your floor.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.740
And it's important to know how
to recognize them, and take

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.420
the necessary precautions.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.860
So if you have this concern, I
would expect that the first

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.010
thing you would do would be to
look at some data concerning

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.890
the characteristics
of vampires.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.460
So there's a little database of
samples of individuals who

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.560
have been determined to be
vampires and not vampires.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.020
And our task today--

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.919
and what you'll understand how
to do by the end of the hour--

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.640
is to use data like this to
build a recognition mechanism

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.740
that would help you to identify
whether someone is a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.000
vampire or an ordinary person.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.080
So this is a little different
from the kind of problem we

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.360
worked with neural nets.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.700
Right?

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.580
So what's the most conspicuous
difference between this data

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.590
set and anything you could think
to work on with nearest

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.080
neighbors, which we
studied last time.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.772
Katie, do you have any thoughts
about why it would be

00:02:42.772 --> 00:02:45.020
difficult to use nearest
neighbors with data like this?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.690
The question mark is there
because this is MIT, and a lot

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.170
of people are completely
nocturnal.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.630
So you can't tell whether they
cast a shadow or not.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.220
We want to take that
into account.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.150
So what's different about
this from the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.851
electrical cover data set?

00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.101
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.550
PATRICK WINSTON: Could you use
the nearest neighbor technique

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.180
to identify vampires
with this data?

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.430
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.120
PATRICK WINSTON:
So obviously--

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.831
Yes, Lana?

00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.081
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:33.807 --> 00:03:35.800
STUDENT: You cannot
really quantify--

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.110
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh,
that's the problem.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.970
This is not numerical data.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.138
This is symbolic.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:44.580
So we're not saying that
your ability to

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.320
cast a shadow is 0.7.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.970
You either cast a shadow,
down cast a

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.200
shadow, or we can't tell.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.770
It's a symbolic result.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.810
So problem number one we have to
face with data of this kind

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.060
is that it's not numeric.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.950
And there are other
characteristics, as well.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.180
For example, it's not clear
that all of these

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.820
characteristics actually
matter.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.490
So some characteristics
don't matter.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.990
And a corollary to that is that
some characteristics do

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.460
matter, but they only matter
part of the time.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.180
And finally, there's
the matter of cost.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.400
Some of these tests may
be more expensive to

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.350
perform than others.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.740
For example, if you wanted to
determine whether someone

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.930
casts a shadow, you'd have to
go to the trouble of getting

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.970
up during daylight.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.000
That might be an expensive
operation for you.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.570
You'd have to go find some
garlic and ask them to eat it.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.070
That might be expensive.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.140
So some of these tests
might be expensive

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.560
relative to other tests.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.110
But once you realize that we are
talking in terms of tests,

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.530
and not a vector of
real values, then

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.920
what you do is clear.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.305
You build yourself a little
tree of tests.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.810
So who knows how this problem
will turn out?

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.210
But you can imagine a situation
where you have one

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.740
test up here which might
have three outcomes.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.520
And one but only one of those
outcomes might require you to

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.020
perform another test.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.940
And only when you've created
the tree of tests that look

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.835
like this are you finished.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.060
So given this set of tests and a
set of samples, the question

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.640
becomes, how do you arrange the
tests in a tree like that

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.250
so as to do the identification
that you want to do?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.030
So since we're talking about
identification, it's not

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.250
surprising that this kind
of tree is called an

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.500
identification tree.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.420
And there's a tendency-- and I
may slip into it myself-- to

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.210
call this a decision tree.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.970
But a decision tree is a label
for something else.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.060
This is an identification
tree.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.170
And the task is to create
a good one.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.330
So what is a good one versus
a not so good one?

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.070
What characteristic would you
like for a decision tree--

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.250
for an identification trade to
have, if you're going to call

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.170
it good identification tree?

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.265
What do you think, Krishna?

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:15.964
What would be a good
characteristic?

00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:18.399
STUDENT: Maybe the minimum
number of levels?

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:18.886
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.

00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:22.110
He said minimum number
of levels.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.960
What's another way you could
say what a good one is?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.680
Each test costs something,
right?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.050
So what's another way of
thinking about what a good

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.864
tree would look like?

00:07:33.864 --> 00:07:34.820
STUDENT: Minimum cost.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.280
PATRICK WINSTON: The
minimum cost.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.810
And if they all have the
same cost, then it's

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.770
the number of tests.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.530
So overall, what you like
is a small tree

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.400
rather than a big one.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.730
So you might be able to take
your sample data and divide it

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.190
up, so that at the bottom of the
tree, at the leaves, all

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.380
of the sets that are produced
by the tests are uniform,

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.070
homogeneous.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.905
We'd like that tree to be the
simplest possible tree you can

00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:05.460
find, not some big complicated
one that also divides up all

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.920
the data into uniform subsets.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.070
By uniform subset--

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.100
at the bottom of the tree, you
have all of the vampires

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.980
together, and all the
non-vampires together.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.840
So you'd like a small tree.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.590
So why not just go all the way
and do British Museum, and

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.946
calculate all possible trees?

00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:28.730
Well, you can do that, but it's
one of those NP problems.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.620
And as you know, NP problems
suck in general.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.929
And so you don't want
to do that.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.820
You want to have some kind of
heuristic mechanism for

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.640
building a small tree.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.590
And we want a small
tree because--

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.900
Why do we want a small tree?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.040
Because of the cost.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.870
but there's another, more
important reason why we want a

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.025
small tree.

00:08:48.025 --> 00:08:50.250
Let me give you a hint.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.090
It's Occam's Razor.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:57.110
The simplest explanation is
often the best explanation.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.650
So if you have a big,
complicated explanation,

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:06.150
that's probably less good than
a simple, small explanation.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.400
Occam's Razor.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.290
Spelled so many ways it doesn't
matter how I spell it.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.090
And that's good, because
I can't spell.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:20.040
So how are we going to go
about finding the best

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.180
possible arrangement
of those four tests

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.470
in a tree like that?

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.630
Well, step one will be
to see what each test

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.340
does with the data.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:36.070
And by the way, before I go a
step further, you know and I

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:40.740
know that this is a sample data
set that's very small,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.090
suitable for classroom
manipulation.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.090
You'd never bet your life on
a data set this small.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.020
We use it only for classroom
illustration.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.970
But imagine that these rows
are multiplied by 10.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.500
So instead of eight samples,
you've got 80.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.670
Then you might begin
to believe the

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.220
results that are produced.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.700
So I'm just going to pretend
that each one of those

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.330
represents 10 other
samples that I

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.530
haven't bothered to show.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.290
But we can work with this one in
the classroom, because it's

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:10.990
pretty small.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.070
And we can say, well, what
does this shadow test do?

00:10:16.034 --> 00:10:20.310
Well, the shadow test divides
the sample population into

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.780
three groups.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.790
There's the I Don't Know group
of people who are nocturnal.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.110
There are the people
who do cast the

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:28.360
shadow, the Yes people.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.220
And the people who do not cast
a shadow, the No people.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.430
So if I look at those rows up
there and see which ones are

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:44.440
vampires, it looks to me that
if there's no shadow cast--

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.140
there's only one that doesn't
cast a shadow--

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.615
and that is a vampire.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.950
So that's a plus over there.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.400
Vampire.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.680
Now, if we look at the ones
who do cast a shadow, all

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.715
those are not vampires.

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:01.965
They're all OK.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.520
And now there're 8.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.450
Three are vampires.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.040
So that means that two of
these must be vampires.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.420
And I've got three, four,
five, six so far.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.340
So there must be two left.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.730
So that's the way the shadow
test divides up the data.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:21.980
Now let's do garlic.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.040
Vampires traditionally
don't eat garlic.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.290
I don't know why.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.480
So we look at the garlic
test, and we see

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.010
that all of the Nos--

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.880
well, there're three
Yeses, and they all

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.920
produce a No answer.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.590
So if somebody eats garlic,
they're not vampires.

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.650
That means the three vampires
must be over here.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.580
Then there are two left.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.040
So that's what the
garlic test does.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.960
See what we're trying to do?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.530
We're trying to look at all
these tests to see which one

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.220
we like best on the basis of
how it divides up the data.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.940
So now we've got complexion.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.970
And there are three
choices for this.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.530
You can have an average
complexion.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.490
But a lot of vampires, in my
experience, are rather pale.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.650
So pale is a possibility.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.210
And then the other option is
that just after gorging

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.610
themselves with blood,
they tend to get a

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.300
little red in the face.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.640
So we'll have a ruddy
over here.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.650
Once again, we have to go back
to our data set to see how

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.640
this test divides things up.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.980
So there are three ruddies, and
one's a No, one's a No,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.670
and one's a Yes.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.920
So two Nos and a Yes.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.680
Two Nos and a Yes.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.300
Now we can try for pale
complexion people.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.100
There are only two of those.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.405
A No and a No.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.310
That must mean that there are
two pluses over here, because

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.370
there are three vampires
altogether.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.681
Two, four, six, seven,
eight, nine.

00:13:13.681 --> 00:13:14.848
Eight, sorry.

00:13:14.848 --> 00:13:15.724
Eight.

00:13:15.724 --> 00:13:17.480
Only eight.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.150
Just one more to go, and
that's the accent.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.560
Historically, vampires go to
great length to protect their

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.600
accent and not betray
their origins.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.900
But nevertheless, we
can expect that if

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.850
they've just arrived--

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.450
if they're just in from

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.470
Transylvania, part of Romania--

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.590
they may still have an accent.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.950
So there's a normal, some still
have a heavy accent, and

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.080
some persist in having
odd accents.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.090
So let's see.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:51.660
Accent.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.630
Four of them, right at the
top, have no accent.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.880
Two Nos and a Yes.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.930
Heavy accent.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:05.910
Three of those.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.390
A Yes and two Nos.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.710
That means we must
have a plus here.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.290
3, 6, plus and a minus.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.400
So we can look at this data and
say, well, what will be

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.610
the best test to use?

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:30.860
And the best test to use would
surely be the one that

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:36.710
produces sets here, at the
bottom of the branches, that

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.950
correspond to the outcomes
of the test.

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.750
We're looking for a test that
produces homogeneous groups.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.120
So just for the sake of
illustration, I'm going to

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.200
suppose that we're going to
judge the quality of the test

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.010
by how many sample individuals
it put into a homogeneous set.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.910
So ideally, we'd like a test
that will put all the vampires

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.670
in one group and all the
ordinary people in another

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.530
group right off the bat.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.260
But there are no such tests.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.400
But we can add up the number of
sample individuals who are

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.460
put in to at least
homogeneous sets.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.140
So when we do that, this
guy has 3 in a

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.470
homogeneous set here.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:20.480
A fourth.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.770
But these are not a
homogeneous set.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.725
So the overall score for
this guy will be 4.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.690
This one, well, not
quite as good.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.130
It only puts 3 individuals
in a homogeneous set.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.870
This one here, 2 individuals
into a homogeneous set.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.150
Everybody else is all
mixed up with some

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.950
other kind of person.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.920
And over here, how many
samples are in

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.670
a homogeneous set?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.920
0.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:59.370
So on the basis of this
analysis, you would conclude

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.470
that the ordering of the test
with respect to their quality

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.250
is left to right.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.210
So the best test must
be the shadow test.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.840
So let's pick the shadow
test first, see what

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.330
we can do with that.

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.850
If we pick the shadow test
first, then we have this

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.100
arrangement.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.200
We have question mark, and we
have Yes, casts a shadow, and

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.610
No, doesn't.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.800
We have 3 minuses here.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.290
We have a plus here.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.890
And unfortunately, over
here, we have plus,

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.060
plus, minus, minus.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.757
So we need another test to
divide that group up.

00:16:37.757 --> 00:16:38.731
Yes.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.653
STUDENT: How did you get the
4 on the shadow test again?

00:16:41.653 --> 00:16:44.100
Why was it 4?

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.760
PATRICK WINSTON: Well,
if I look at the

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.870
data and I see who--

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.100
the question is, what about
that shadow test?

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.990
If you look at the shadow test,
and you say, well, there

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.270
are 4 question marks.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.210
And if we look and see what kind
of people belong to those

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.990
4 question marks, there are 2
vampires and 2 non-vampires.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.760
That's why it's 2 pluses
and 2 minuses.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.149
STUDENT: No, I understand
that.

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:07.853
The question is, how did you
get to the score of 4?

00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:10.450
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, yeah.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.780
The question is how did
I get this number 4?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.829
It has nothing to do this,
because this is a mixed set.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.810
In fact, I've got three guys in
a homogeneous set here, and

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.240
one guy in a homogeneous
set here, and I'm

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.399
just adding them up.

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:21.079
STUDENT: OK.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.190
PATRICK WINSTON: So very simple
classroom illustration.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.790
Wouldn't work in practice.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.099
Yes.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:27.969
STUDENT: How do you adjust
this for larger data sets

00:17:27.969 --> 00:17:30.390
where it's unlikely you're going
to have any [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.770
PATRICK WINSTON: The question
is, how do I adjust this for

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.580
larger data sets?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.830
You're one step ahead.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.540
Trust me, I'll be doing large
data sets in a moment.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.550
I just want to get
the idea across.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.210
And I don't want there to be any
thought that the method we

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.720
use for larger data sets has got
anything magic about it.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.450
OK, so we're off and running.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.710
And now we have to pick a
test that will divide

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.590
those four guys up.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.060
So we're going to have to work
this a little harder, and

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.610
repeat the analysis
we did there.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:05.350
But at least it'll be simpler,
because now we're only

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.220
considering 4 samples, not 8.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.930
Just the 4 samples that we still
have to divide up that

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.240
have come down that
left branch.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.590
So I have the shadow test.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.580
It has 3 outcomes.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.380
We have the garlic test.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.080
It has 2 outcomes.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.560
Yes and No.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.430
We have the complexion test.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.100
There's 3 outcomes.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.230
Average, pale, and ruddy.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.300
And we have finally
the accent test.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:50.610
And that comes out to be either
normal, heavy, or odd.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.340
And now, it's a little awkward
to figure out what the results

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.500
are for this data
set as shown.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.910
So let me just strike out.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:04.000
The ones that we're no longer
concerned with, and limit our

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.240
analysis to the samples for
which the outcome of the

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.790
shadow test is a
question mark.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.740
This is exactly the four
people we still need to

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.240
separate, right?

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.170
So switching colors, keeping
the color the same.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.460
We actually don't want
to do the shadow

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.340
test anymore, right?

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.810
Because we've already
done that.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.100
There's no point in
doing that again.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.170
We don't have to look at that.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.890
It's already done all the
division of data that it can.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.260
So the garlic test.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.050
Well, let's see.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:33.920
Garlic.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.480
2 Yeses, 2 Nos.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.040
The Yeses produce Nos and
the Nos produce Yeses.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.210
So if the person does eat
garlic, they're OK.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.686
And if they don't eat garlic,
bad news-- they're vampires.

00:19:48.686 --> 00:19:50.320
Well, that looks like
a pretty good test.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.420
But just for the sake of working
it all out, let's try

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.820
the others.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.070
Complexion.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.575
2 Ruddies, a Yes, and a No.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.540
1 pale, and that's a No.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.370
1 pale, and that's a No.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:17.590
And we must have 1 average, and
sure enough, that's a Yes.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.790
Now we can do accent, the one on
the far right, and look at

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:23.820
how that measures up against the
people who are still under

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.860
consideration as samples.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.550
Accent.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:26.990
Let's see.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.010
2 Nones, a Yes and a No.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:34.840
No Heavies.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.396
2 Odds, a Yes and a No.

00:20:39.396 --> 00:20:39.850
All right.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.060
So now we can do the same thing
we did before, and just

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.400
say, for sake of classroom
illustration, how many

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.230
individuals are put into
a homogeneous sets.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.120
And here we have 4.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:54.830
And here we have 2.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.420
And here we have 0.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.000
So plainly, the garlic test
is the test of choice.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.810
So we go back over here, and
we've completed the work that

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.860
we needed to do.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.970
So that's the garlic test.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.070
And that produces 2 pluses.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.630
Let's see.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.340
Eats garlic, Yes.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.480
Eats garlic, No.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.565
I guess the pluses go
over here like so.

00:21:22.565 --> 00:21:24.860
And these are the two
ordinary people.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.710
And we're done with our task.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.080
And now you can quickly run
off and put this into your

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.360
PDA, and forever be protected
against the possibility that

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.135
one of those vampires got out
in the flood of people that

00:21:36.135 --> 00:21:38.380
came in from Eastern Europe.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:42.220
Except what do we do
a large data set?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.280
Well, the trouble is,
a large data set's

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.530
not likely to produce--

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.320
if you have a large data set,
no test is likely to put

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.310
together any homogeneous
set right off.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:00.300
So you never get started.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.210
Everything would be 0.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.110
Every test would say, oh it
doesn't put anybody into

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.280
homogeneous sets.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.530
So you're screwed.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:16.000
You need some other, more
sophisticated way of measuring

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.580
how disordered this data is.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.040
Or how disordered these sets
are that you find at the

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.740
bottom of the tree branches.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.500
That's what you need.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:31.130
You need a way of measuring
disorder of these sets that

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.740
you find at the bottom of these
branches, so you can

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.750
find a kind of overall quality
to the test based on your

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:40.250
measurement of disorder.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.010
Now, the first heuristic of a
good life is, when you have a

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.120
problem to solve, ask somebody
who knows the answer.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.180
It's the least amount of work.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.060
It's not even as hard
going to Google.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.010
So who would you ask
about ways of

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.260
measuring disorder in sets?

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.510
There are two possible
answers.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.060
STUDENT: You could
just do entropy.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.325
PATRICK WINSTON: What?

00:23:07.325 --> 00:23:09.840
STUDENT: Find the entropy
of the set.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.345
PATRICK WINSTON: Who
studies entropy?

00:23:11.345 --> 00:23:13.350
STUDENT: Probability.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.402
PATRICK WINSTON: What
kind of classes?

00:23:15.402 --> 00:23:15.898
STUDENT: Physics.

00:23:15.898 --> 00:23:16.890
STUDENT: Thermodynamics.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.415
PATRICK WINSTON:
Thermodynamics!

00:23:18.415 --> 00:23:21.125
The thermodynamicists are good
at measuring disorder, because

00:23:21.125 --> 00:23:22.900
that's what thermodynamics
is all about.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.640
Entropy increasing over time,
and all that sort of stuff.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.834
There's another equally
good answer.

00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:30.720
STUDENT: Statisticians?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.400
PATRICK WINSTON:
Statisticians.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.680
Perhaps, but it's not the
second best answer.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.190
It's actually not even
the best answer.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.930
That's the best answer.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:40.643
What's your name?

00:23:40.643 --> 00:23:41.510
STUDENT: Leo.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.760
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh, yeah.

00:23:45.322 --> 00:23:49.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.870
PATRICK WINSTON: Leonardo has
got his finger on it.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.420
The information theorists are
pretty good at measuring

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.440
disorder, because that's what
information is all about, too.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.130
So we might as well borrow a
mechanism for measuring the

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.970
disorder of a set from those
information theory guys.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.710
So what we're going to
do is exactly that.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.760
Let's put it over here, so we'll
have it handy when we

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.060
want to try to measure
those things.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.800
The gospel according to
information theorists is that

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.910
the disorder, D, or some set
is equal to-- now let's

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.500
suppose that this is a
set of binary values.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.720
So we have positives and
then we have negatives.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.490
Pluses and minuses.

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.640
But pluses, they don't go very
well in an algebraic equation,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.790
because they might be confused
with adding.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.900
So I'm going to say P and N. And
then it'll be the total,

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.030
which is P plus N. We only
have two choices,

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.090
positive and negative.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.850
So the disorder of set,
according those guys, is equal

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:59.400
to minus the number of positives
over the total

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.440
number, times the log to the
base 2 of the positives over

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:13.260
the total, minus the negatives
over the total, times the log

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.270
2 of the negatives
over the total.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.780
Those negatives look a little
worrisome, because you think,

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.210
well, maybe this thing
can go negative.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.390
But that's not going
to be true, right?

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.170
Because these ratios are all
less than 1, and the logarithm

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.830
of something that's less
than 1 is negative.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.770
So we're OK.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:37.040
So that's a lovely way of
measuring disorder.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.020
And then we ought to draw
a graph of what

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.270
that curve looks like.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.720
And what we're going to graph
it against is the ratio of

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:52.500
positives to the total number.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.730
So that's going to be an axis
where we go from 0 to 1.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.750
So let's just find a couple
of useful values.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.920
And by the way, it pays to pay
attention to these curves,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.890
because if you pay attention
to this stuff, you can work

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.980
the quiz questions on
this very rapidly.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.460
Otherwise, we see people getting
out their calculators

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.020
and quickly becoming both
lost and screwed.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.160
OK so let's see.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.100
Let's suppose that the number
of positives is equal to the

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.810
number of negatives.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:32.260
So we've got a completely
mixed-up set.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.470
It has no bias in either
direction.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:41.310
So in that case, if P over T is
equal to 1/2, then this is

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:51.230
equal to minus 1/2, times
the logarithm of 1/2.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.360
And I guess, since they're
both the same, we

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.400
can multiply by two.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.650
And what's that value?

00:27:00.596 --> 00:27:04.768
[INAUDIBLE], what does that
calculate out to?

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:06.716
STUDENT: Minus [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:06.716 --> 00:27:09.650
PATRICK WINSTON: Minus
[INAUDIBLE].

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:11.790
Well, with a minus sign, you
just turn the argument upside

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:12.950
down, so it's log(2).

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.890
So what's log(2)?

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.920
Logarithm of base 2 of 2?

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.870
1!

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.720
So this whole thing is--

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.020
STUDENT: 1.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.000
PATRICK WINSTON: 1.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.650
So [INAUDIBLE], in her soft way,
says, well, let's see.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:28.800
2 times 1/2.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.710
That cancels out.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:32.680
The minus, that flips the
arguments so it's log to the

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.640
base 2 of 2, and that's 1.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.785
So this whole thing, You
work out the algebra,

00:27:38.785 --> 00:27:40.710
it gives you 1.

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.740
So that's cool.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.460
So right here in the middle
where they're equal, we get a

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.710
value of 1.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.610
Next thing we need to do is
let's calculate what happens

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:59.610
if P over T is equal to 1.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.450
That is to say, everything
is a positive.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.100
Any guesses?

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:06.410
Maybe 10, 20, minus 15?

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.650
Let's work it out.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:16.946
So if P over T equal 1, that
would be minus 1 times the log

00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:21.120
to the base 2 of 1.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.642
What's that?

00:28:22.642 --> 00:28:24.040
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.570
PATRICK WINSTON: A 0?

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:25.910
Oh, yeah.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:30.430
Because 2 raise to
the 0 is one.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:31.715
So this part is 0.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.560
Now, what about this
other part?

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.190
If everything's a P, then
nothing's an N.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.320
So we've got 0.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.820
And we can quit already.

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.590
Well, not quite.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:46.710
We ought to work it out.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.290
Log 2 to the base 2 of 0.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.344
What's that?

00:28:51.344 --> 00:28:53.320
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.710
PATRICK WINSTON: Who?

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.110
Minus infinity?

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.100
Uh oh.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.140
0 times minus infinity is What
I didn't get that when I was

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.470
in high school.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:06.550
Finally, 1801 makes
a difference.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.390
Finally.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.630
What's the answer.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:16.280
We're interested in the limit as
N over T goes to 0, right?

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.392
And when you have a deal like
this, what do you do?

00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:25.330
You use that famous rule, that
we all mispronounce when we

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.600
see it written, right?

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.240
We use the good old El
Hospital's rule.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.210
OK, it's L'Hopital.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.610
L'Hopital's Rule.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:36.720
You have to differentiate
the--

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.880
I guess we differentiate this
guy as a ratio or something,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.610
and see what happens
when it goes to 0.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.130
And what we get when we use
L'Hopital's Rule is that, oh

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.100
thank God, this is still zero.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.980
So now we know that we have a
point up there and a point

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:55.740
down there.

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:57.410
So now we've got three
points on the curve,

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.660
and we can draw it.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.560
It goes like that.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.260
No, it doesn't go like that.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.400
It's obviously a Gaussian,
right?

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.240
Because everything in a
nature is a Gaussian.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.640
Can you put that laptop
away, please?

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.260
Everything in nature
is a Gaussian, so

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:14.510
it looks like this.

00:30:18.158 --> 00:30:21.020
That right?

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.840
No, actually, not everything
in nature is a Gaussian.

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.880
And in particular, this one
isn't a Gaussian either.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.400
It looks more like one of those
metal things they used

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.660
to call quonset huts.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.612
That's what it looks like.

00:30:34.612 --> 00:30:37.100
Boom, like so.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.270
So that is the curve
of interest.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.540
Now, did God say that using this
way of measuring disorder

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.950
was the best way?

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:51.930
No, Got has not indicated
any choice here.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.570
We use this because it's a
convenient mechanism, it seems

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.440
to make sense, but in contrast
to the reason it's used

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.690
information theory, it's not
the result of some elegant

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:02.270
mathematics.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.870
It's just a borrowing of
something that seems to work

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.870
pretty well.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.560
Any of those curves would work
just about the same, because

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.240
all we're doing with
it is measuring how

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.780
disordered a set is.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.950
So one thing to note here is
that in this situation, where

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.350
we're dealing with
two choices--

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:23.340
P and N, positives
and negatives--

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.450
we get a curve that
maxes out at one.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.830
And notice that it kind of gets
up there pretty fast.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:33.890
In fact, if you're down here
at 2/3, are you're up here,

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:39.090
this is about 0.9.

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:43.770
So it gives you a large number
for quite a bit of that area

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.940
in the middle.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.210
So that, unfortunately, still
doesn't tell us everything we

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:49.550
need to know.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.700
That tells us how to measure a
disorder in one of these sets.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.680
But we want to know how to
measure the quality of the

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.750
test overall.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.950
So we need some mechanism that
says, OK, given that this test

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.370
produces three different sets,
and we now have a measure of

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.100
the disorder in each of these
sets, how do we measure the

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.496
overall quality of the test?

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:14.360
Well, you could just add
up the disorder.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.630
Let's write that down, because
that sounds good.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:33.200
So you can say that the quality
of a test is equal to

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.160
some sum over the
sets produced.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.640
And what we're going to do is
we're going to add up the

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.620
disorder of each
of those sets.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.220
I'm almost home, except that
this means we're going to give

00:32:53.220 --> 00:33:00.210
equal weight to a branch that
has almost nothing down it--

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.190
we're going to give the same
weight to that as a branch

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.920
that has almost everything
going down it.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.150
So that doesn't seem
that make sense.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:12.050
So one final flourish is we're
going to weight this sum

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:16.360
according to the fraction of the
samples that end up down

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.200
that branch.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.840
So it's, as usual, easier to
write it down than to say it.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.370
So we're going to multiply
that times the number of

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:41.530
samples in the set, divided
by the number of

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:51.390
samples handled by test.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.570
So if half the samples go down
a branch, and if that branch

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.500
has a certain disorder, then
we're going to multiply that

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.090
disorder times 1/2.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:04.570
All right.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.610
So now let's see how it works
with our sample problem.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.139
Well, here is our sample data.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.780
And we didn't need anything
fancy for it.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.270
But let's pretend it was
a large data set.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.790
Well, let's see.

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:17.590
What would we do?

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:23.020
Well, go down this
way, there are 4

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.639
samples down that direction.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.790
That's half of the total
number of samples.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:28.139
So whatever we find down
there, we're going

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.820
to multiply by 1/2.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.150
This one we're going
to multiply by 3/8.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.889
And this one we're going
to multiply by 1/8.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.969
Now, what do we actually find at
the bottom of these things?

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.170
Well, here's a homogeneous
set.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.770
Everything's the same.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.560
So we go to that curve and say,
what is the disorder of a

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.949
homogeneous set?

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.199
It's zero.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.090
Let's see, they're
all the same.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.640
I guess that means it's
0 over there.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:04.470
So the disorder of this set
of three samples is zero.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.260
The disorder of this set
of one sample, all

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.110
the same, is zero.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.720
The disorder of this set--
well, let's see.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.780
Half of the samples there are
plus, and half are minus, so

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.830
we go over to our curve, and we
say, what's the disorder of

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.640
something with equal mixture
of pluses and minuses?

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:25.500
And that's one.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.560
So the disorder of
this guy is one.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.590
So now we've got 1/2 times 1,
and 3/8 times 0, 1/8 times 0.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.660
So the quality of this
particular test, as determined

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:43.770
by the disorder of the sets
it produces, is 1/5.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.020
0.5.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.420
Let's do this one.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:53.910
So we have 3/8 coming
down this way, 5/8

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:55.270
coming down this way.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.610
3/8 is multiplied by
the disorder of a

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:58.730
set of uniform things.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.370
That's disorder 0.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.540
So this guy over here,
let's see.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:09.160
That's 2/5 and 3/5
multiplied--

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.010
You know, this is one of those
deals where if you look at the

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.840
curve, you're pretty close
to the middle.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:18.470
And that curve goes all the
way up to about 0.9 there.

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.560
So you can kind of just look at
this, and eyeball it, and

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:27.010
say, well, whatever it is, the
overall, this is going to be

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.060
something multiplied
times 5/8.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.680
Something like 0.9 times 5/8.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.440
So let's just say, for the
sake of discussion, that

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.550
that's going to be about 0.6,
which is within a hundredth, I

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:41.340
think, of being right.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.220
Just kind of guessing.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.440
OK, well now we're on a roll.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.040
Here, we have 3/8 coming down
this branch, 3/8 coming down

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.640
this branch, 1/4 coming
down this branch.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.510
This is 0.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.910
And this is one of those deals
where these two are about 0.9.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:05.680
So it looks like it's going
to be 3/8 plus 3/8 is 3/4.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.640
Times about 0.9.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.602
So that's going to turn
out to be about 0.7.

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.230
So one last go here.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:24.850
3/8, 3/8, and 1/4.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:26.280
Oh, that's interesting.

00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.890
Because these two
are what we got

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.490
contributed up to that 0.7.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.390
This one is 0.4 times--

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.090
this is evenly divided,
so that's going to

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.380
have disorder of 1.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.910
So that's going to be
0.25 bigger than the

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:45.610
number we got over here.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:51.410
So that's going to end
up being about 0.95.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.980
So thanks god our answer is the
same as we got with our

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.130
simple classroom measurement
of disorder.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.800
Except this is measuring how
disordered stuff is, we want

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.520
the small number, not
the big number.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:06.110
So once again, based on this
analysis, you'll be sure to

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:10.730
pick the shadow cast, because
0.5 is less than 0.6, which is

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.640
less than 0.7, which
is less than 0.95.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.310
So that accent test is
really horrible.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.380
Don't use it.

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:20.160
Just because somebody has a
heavy accent doesn't mean

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.430
they're a vampire.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:24.240
In fact, most vampires have
worked very hard on their

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:26.450
accent, as I mentioned before.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.470
All right, so now we know that
we're still going to pick the

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.440
shadow test as our first go.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.040
So that's good.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.460
Now, let's see if we can repeat
the exercise with our

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.290
second selection, the one we
have to have to pick those

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.910
guys apart.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.760
And this is going to be easier,
because there are

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.280
fewer things to work with.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.700
Ooh, wow, look.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.930
That's 0.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.030
That's 0.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.530
That's 1/2.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.000
That's 1/2.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.030
So the disorder of
this guy is 0.0.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:05.630
So this is 1/4, 1/4,
1/2, 0, 0.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.140
1/2 times 1.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.590
Ooh, that's 0.5.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.500
That was easy.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.740
How about this one?

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.300
Oh, he says 1.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:13.500
Let's see.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:14.210
That's 1.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.170
That's 1.

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:16.130
That's 1/2.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.890
That's 1/2.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:20.130
Yeah, it is one.

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.480
So sure enough, the answer also
comes out to be the same

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.450
as before, when we did our just

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:27.160
simple intuition exercise.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.710
So I don't know.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:33.895
Christopher, is this all about
using information theory?

00:39:33.895 --> 00:39:34.320
STUDENT: No.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.570
PATRICK WINSTON: No, no, no.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.010
See, it's not about the math.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:41.000
It's about the intuition.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.630
And the intuition is that you
want to build a tree that's as

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:44.750
simple as possible.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.500
And you can build a tree that's
as simple as possible

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.610
if you look at the data, and
say, well, which test does the

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:52.640
best job of splitting
things up?

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.150
Which test does the best job of
building subsets underneath

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.310
it that are as homogeneous
as possible?

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:03.330
So all this information theory,
all this entropy

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:07.290
stuff, is just a convenient
mechanism for doing something

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.440
that is intuitionally sound.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.175
OK?

00:40:10.175 --> 00:40:11.840
It's not about information
theory.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.990
It's about a sound intuition.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.400
Oh, by the way.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.440
Does this kind of stuff ever
get used in practice?

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.780
10s of thousands of times.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:25.400
This is a winning mechanism
that's used over and over

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:30.320
again, even when the
data is numeric.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.170
How would it work if
it's numeric data?

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:33.660
Well, let's think about
that for a little bit.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.620
So let's suppose that we
have an opportunity.

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.430
We're an EMT or something,
we work in the infirmary.

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.360
What do they call
it these days?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:49.940
Something else.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.500
But anyhow, you work in that
kind of area, and you have the

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.420
opportunity to take people's
temperature.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.230
And so over time, you've
accumulated some data on the

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.320
temperature of people.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.020
And maybe you've found that
there's a vampire

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.140
here at about 102.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.980
There's a normal person
here, about 98.6.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.000
But then they're scattered
around.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.960
Some people have fevers
when they come in.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.950
So the question is, is there a
way of using numerical data--

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.750
things that you can
put real numbers--

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.180
is there a way of using that
with this mechanism?

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.320
And the answer is yes.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.180
You just say, is the temperature
greater than or

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.910
less than some threshold?

00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:33.620
And that gives you a test, a
binary test, just like any of

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.460
these other tests.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:37.000
[? Krishna? ?]

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.930
Right?

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.180
But where would I put
the threshold?

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.480
I suppose I could just put
it at the average value.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.100
But that might not be the place
that does the best job

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:57.400
of splitting the samples into
homogeneous groups.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:57.690
Christopher?

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.788
STUDENT: So you run this
numerical analysis on

00:41:59.788 --> 00:42:01.150
different places with different
thresholds.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.070
PATRICK WINSTON: So you try
different places, he says.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.340
And he's right.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.980
Because this is a computer,
this is our slave.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.930
We don't care how much
it works to figure

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.660
out the right threshold.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.610
So what we do is we say, well,
maybe the threshold's halfway

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:17.835
between those two guys, or
halfway between those two

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.450
guys, or those two guys,
or those two guys,

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:20.940
or those two guys.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.540
So we can try one
less threshold

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.600
than we have samples.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600
And we don't care if there are
10,000 samples, because this

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.720
is a computer, and we don't care
if it works all night.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.750
So that's how you find the
threshold for a numeric test.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.520
By the way, I assured you
earlier on you would never use

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.360
the same test twice.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.190
Is that true for this?

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.910
Yes, you would still never
use the same test twice.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:41.320
But what you might do is you
might use a different

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.860
threshold on the same
measurement

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.940
the next time around.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.480
So when you start having
numerical data, you may find

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:57.730
yourself using the same test
with the same axis but with a

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:00.000
different value.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.330
All right.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:05.500
So now that we have this, then
we can go back and compare how

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.660
this method would look when we
put it up against the sort of

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.290
stuff we were talking about
last time, with

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.700
the electrical covers.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.020
So with the electrical covers,
we had a situation like this.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:25.470
I don't know.

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:31.290
We had samples that were places
like this, and we had a

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.510
division of the space that look
pretty much like that.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:42.000
Not quite exactly in the right
spots, but pretty close.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.660
So these are the decision
boundaries for the situation

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:47.540
where we are using nearest
neighbors to

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.608
divide up the data.

00:43:50.608 --> 00:43:53.310
What would the decision
boundaries look like if these

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.940
were four different kinds of
things, and we were using this

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.190
kind of mechanism?

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.640
And maybe there's a lot of
samples all clustered around

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.170
places like that.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.280
What would the decision
boundaries look like?

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.830
Would they be the
same as this?

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:12.470
god, I hope not.

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.400
Why?

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.700
Because what we're going to
do is we're going to use a

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.320
threshold on each axis.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.990
So therefore, the decision
boundaries are going to be

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:26.100
parallel to one axis
or the other.

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.460
So we might decide,
for example--

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:30.220
Oh, shoot.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.480
I think I'll draw it again,
because it'll get confused if

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.530
I draw it over the other one.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.720
So it looks like this.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.270
And that's how nearest
neighbors does it.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:44.540
But a identification tree
approach will pick a threshold

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.870
along one axis or the other.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.340
Let's say it's this axis.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.580
It's only got one
choice there.

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:53.370
So it's going to put
a line there.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.820
And now, what's the next
thing it does?

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.370
Well, it still has these
two different kinds

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.250
of things to separate.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:01.300
We're going to assume
we've got four

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.380
different kinds of things.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.220
So it's going to say, oh!

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:12.650
I've Come down the negative
side, so I need a threshold on

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:14.440
the remaining data.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.260
And these are the only two
things that are now remaining.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:23.030
So my only choice is to put
a threshold in there.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.370
Now I guarantee this, absolutely
guaranteed--

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.570
on the quiz, somebody--

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.090
presumably somebody who doesn't
go to lectures--

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.890
will draw that line all
the way across.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:35.730
And that's desperately wrong.

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:39.780
Because we've already divided
this data set in half.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.170
Now the choice of what we do
over here is governed only by

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.270
the remaining samples that
we see, these two.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.420
And so the threshold is going
to go in there like that.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.050
So that's what happens
when you go back.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:59.270
This is used 10s of thousands
of times.

00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:00.250
Always used.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.460
What are the virtues of it?

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.360
Number one, you don't
use all the tests.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.630
You use only the test that seem
to be doing some useful

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:09.250
work for you.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.750
So that means that you do a
better job, because your

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.580
measurement technique
is simpler.

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.220
And it costs less, because
you're not going to the

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:21.140
expense of doing all
of the testing.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.910
So it's a real winner.

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.230
But you know what?

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.200
Some classes of people--

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.420
not scientists, but I mean
people like doctors and stuff.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.750
They don't like to look
at these tress.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.170
They're kind of rule-oriented.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:40.370
So they look a tree like this
for determining what kind of

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:45.420
thyroid disease you have, and
it would have maybe 20 or so

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.670
tests in it of various kinds
of hormones, like thyroxine

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:50.200
and this and that.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.560
And they say, ah, we can't
deal with that.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:56.400
So we have to work with them.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.230
So what we do is we convert the
tree into a set of rules.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.030
How do we convert the tree
into a set of rules?

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.560
Oops, wrong one.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.810
Go away, go away.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:17.030
Here's what I want.

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:18.070
Yeah, good.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:21.480
How would we convert this tree
into a set of rules?

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.470
It's straightforward.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:23.680
[INAUDIBLE], what do we do?

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.390
STUDENT: You'd basically just
look down each branch--

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:26.730
PATRICK WINSTON: You'd basically
just go down each

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.510
branch to a leaf.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.990
So you say, for example,
here's one rule.

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:44.970
If shadow equals question mark,
and garlic equals oh,

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.770
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.020
want to choose No.

00:47:50.012 --> 00:47:51.880
Doesn't eat garlic.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.350
No.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.130
I think I'll say Yes.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:54.810
Yes.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.060
That changes the answer.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.430
Then if it eats garlic, it's
not a vampire, right?

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.700
That's one of four possible
rules, because there are four

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.440
leaf nodes.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.900
Now, almost done.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.170
We are done, except
for one thing.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.160
We can actually take these four
rules, and start thinking

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.950
about how to simplify them.

00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:26.140
You can ask questions like, if
I have a rule that tests both

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.280
the shadow and the garlic, do I
actually need both of those

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:30.550
antecedents?

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.950
And the answer is, in
many cases, no.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:35.890
And in particular,
in this case, no.

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:40.700
Because if we look at our data
set, what we discover is that

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.180
in the event that we're
talking about a shadow

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.285
question mark--

00:48:46.285 --> 00:48:49.240
oh, I guess I had a better
choice the other way.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:49.880
Oh, no.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.200
If you look at the garlic,
all the garlics--

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.300
Yes, Yes, and Yes--

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:57.600
it turns out that the answer is
no, independent of what the

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.630
shadow condition is.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:01.680
So we can look at the rules,
and in some cases, we'll

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.050
discover that our tree is a
little bit more complicated

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:04.730
than it needs to be.

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.800
We can actually get rid of
some of the clauses.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.340
So in the end, we can develop a
very simple mechanism based

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.760
on good old fashioned rule-based
behavior, like you

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.820
saw almost in the beginning
of the subject,

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:16.940
that does the job.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:22.710
And now, without any royalty,
you're all free to put this in

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:25.610
your PDA and use it to protect
yourself in the days to com,

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.430
especially since Halloween's
just around the corner.
