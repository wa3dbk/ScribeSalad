00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.640
PROFESSOR: Hope everyone had
a great Veteran's Day break

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.670
yesterday, spending
it, of course,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.049
as I check my test audience,
spending it mostly doing

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.050
your [INAUDIBLE]
research or PSETs.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.910
But at least one
person got to watch TV.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.830
So at least one person
got to have a real break,

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.170
and that's something
truly amazing and special.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.160
So now we're going
to talk about SVMs.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.990
They're pretty much the
hardest thing in 6.034.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.280
However, in recent
years a few shortcuts

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.384
have popped up
that will sometimes

00:01:00.384 --> 00:01:02.800
allow you to solve the question,
depending on what they're

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.170
asking for, without solving
some vast ugly set of equations

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.630
with a vast ugly
number of unknowns.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.410
So I'm going to show
that to you guys.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.910
I'm also going to try to
explain all the alphabet

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.620
soup that's in [INAUDIBLE]
and what all the letters stand

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.260
for because it took me a few
times going through SVMs.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.810
It took me a few times
going through SVMs

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.174
to actually find
out for sure what

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:33.340
all those letters stood for.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.630
And if you guys figure
it out first try,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.130
that's going to be great, and
you guys will be just fine.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.490
So let's take a look at
the problem that's perhaps

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.470
most optimized for using some
of the shortcuts to solving it

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.560
and not putting up
all the equations.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.180
Then I will-- not
because I'm sadistic,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.630
but because I'm being nice,
I will force you with me

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.240
to solve some of the things they
didn't ask for us to solve so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.260
that you can see that
we can't get away

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.680
with everything without doing
some of the harder stuff.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.770
And of course, definitely
ask questions as always,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.330
but this time even more so.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.350
You guys, well, if you
were looking around,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.520
you saw nobody in this
entire lecture hall

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.880
raised their hand that they
are already set and ready

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.120
and know SVMs.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.390
So if you have a question,
maybe everybody else does.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.030
So let's go.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.180
We'll start right here.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.520
As always, pretend
that I can draw,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.870
and that therefore all the
pluses and minuses are only

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.105
on integer coordinates.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.620
So we are asked in this problem
to circle the support vectors.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.020
Draw the edges of the street
and then the dotted line

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.850
in the middle that
separates them,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.940
the separator, as a dashed line.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.140
And then to give w and b.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.920
So what are w and b?

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.300
Well, there's a few
important equations in SVMs

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.924
that we really
hope-- and I'm going

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:25.340
to tell you we're lucky in
this because we don't have to--

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.910
but we really hope
that we don't have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.960
to use because they provide
a huge number of variables.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.500
So one of those
crucial equations

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.190
is that for a plus support
vector, w vector dot x plus,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.095
the plus support
vector, plus b equals 1.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:55.630
w dot x minus plus
b equals minus 1.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.490
And w dot that dotted
line-- I don't know,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.140
we'll call it dot dot
dot-- plus b equals 0.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.410
So what does this mean?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.400
There are a lot of vectors.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.430
Well, I mean, we're usually
in two-dimensional space,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.810
so we can basically
just say that there's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.899
two components of this
w vector, w1 and w2.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.130
And they're just
two coefficients

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.810
in a linear equation.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.850
So for instance, what we're
interested in finding,

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.690
this dot dot dot
line, we'll just

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.920
call that x, so
with nothing on it.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.840
Actually, maybe
that'll be easier.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:44.900
This is equivalent to saying
w1x1 plus w2x2 plus b equals 0,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.380
where x1 is this,
and x2 is this.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.210
We would possibly
call them x and y.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.690
So one way to think
about it is w1,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.200
we'll call it a, ax
plus-- call w2 b-- by.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.890
Oh, don't call it b.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.340
Well, ax plus cy plus b
equals-- I'll put this all in

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.740
parentheses-- this is basically
an equation like this.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:29.830
Or y equals negative a
over c x minus b over c.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.270
It's basically y
equals mx plus b.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.394
Does everyone see that?

00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:35.810
This thing that
we're looking for,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.490
this w dot x plus b
equals 0, is the equation

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.440
of a line in
Cartesian coordinates.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.840
It just looks uglier.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.320
Normally, when we're doing
all this solving for w and b,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.790
we would have to put
in tons of equations,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.940
plug in all of the
support vectors in there.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.220
And we'd have to use these
little devils called alphas.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.280
Alphas essentially--
if it wasn't clear

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.650
in the lecture, which it
usually isn't completely

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.420
clear to everyone, wasn't clear
to me completely-- alphas,

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.120
the way I like to
think about them,

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.630
the alphas in this
problem is they

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.390
are the weight of how
significant any particular

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.280
point on the graph is towards
creating the boundary.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.845
The higher the
alpha is, the more

00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:32.210
that that point narrows
in the boundary.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.740
The lower the alpha is, the
less that that point narrows

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.570
in the boundary, the
wider the road can be.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.320
And if that point
doesn't do anything,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.327
if that point is irrelevant
and could be removed

00:06:42.327 --> 00:06:44.410
and it wouldn't affect the
boundary, the alpha is?

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.230
Everyone?

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.964
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:46.630
PROFESSOR: Zero.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.940
Well, that was one person, but
you can suffice for everyone.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.060
The alpha is 0.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.620
And that means if it's not a
support vector, if it's not

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.520
one of the vectors on
the boundary lines,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.210
it will always have an alpha
of 0 because it doesn't affect.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.380
So keeping that in
mind, there's a few fun

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.072
and important
equations about alphas

00:07:08.072 --> 00:07:10.030
that we'll need if we're
solving many equations

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.990
for many unknowns, which
hopefully we won't have to do.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.380
The sum over the
positive alphas equals

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:23.300
the sum over the alphas--
the negative points.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.530
And this is true
over all the points.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.830
But since all of
the alphas are 0,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.560
except for the support
vectors, it also

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.710
means the alphas of
the positive support

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.250
vectors are equal to the
alphas of the negative support

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.490
vectors.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.070
Additionally, our old
buddy, the w vector,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:46.450
is equal to the
sum over all i that

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:56.800
are plus vectors of wi
alpha i minus m over j

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.500
minus vectors of wj alpha j.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.510
Now, all of these equations
can be used in a bloody mess

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.110
to figure out the answer to
what we're trying to find,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.940
which is circles--
well, actually, they

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.580
can't be used as
circle support vectors

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.820
and draw the dotted line.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.450
But once we do that,
all these equations

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.860
can be used in a bloody mess to
give us the next thing that we

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.380
want, which is w and b.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:35.120
So fortunately, there's
another way to get w and b.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.429
If you guys really want,
at the end of the hour

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:43.080
we can also try to
derive w and b using

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.740
the many equations
in many unknowns,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.200
but it's a bit painful.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.930
We'll try to do it the cool way.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.545
So let's start off.

00:08:50.545 --> 00:08:51.920
This is the one
we're looking at.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.590
We need to find where
the support vectors are.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.010
So the first thing we need
to do is simply eye it.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.970
Fortunately, on the
test, there will always

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.960
be ones that you can
eye if you're supposed

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.850
to circle the support vectors.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.200
There's obviously
some number of pluses

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.460
and some number of minuses.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.564
I say obviously, but maybe not.

00:09:11.564 --> 00:09:12.980
But hopefully
obviously, and we'll

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.490
find out because I'm going
to call on random people.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.899
So give me a positive
support vector.

00:09:19.899 --> 00:09:28.120
AUDIENCE: Um, going to the one
that looked like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.210
PROFESSOR: Which plus
sign, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.580
AUDIENCE: One on the right.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.380
PROFESSOR: The one all
the way on the right.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.840
Yeah, that plus sign is a
positive support vector.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.170
That's good.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:37.920
All right?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.256
Excellent.

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:40.880
Now, give me a negative
support vector.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:45.310
That one?

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.114
No?

00:09:50.114 --> 00:09:51.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.113
PROFESSOR: Ah, no problem.

00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:53.530
Give me a negative
support vector.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.904
AUDIENCE: I should
definitely ask

00:09:54.904 --> 00:09:56.470
you, what's a support vector?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:57.955 --> 00:09:59.440
PROFESSOR: That is
a good question.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.720
The question is, what
is a support vector?

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.600
How many other people will
admit to having this question?

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.100
See?

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.225
You're not alone.

00:10:12.225 --> 00:10:12.725
OK.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.390
Before I go on, I'm going
to assume-- you guys make

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.331
sure I'm correct-- Monday
was, just being sure

00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:23.580
so I can tailor based on this.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.230
Monday was the support
vector machine lecture.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.470
But it was also very
difficult to follow.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.460
That's what I usually expect.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.170
So what is a support vector?

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.350
Well, all these pluses and
minuses, if we were me,

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.600
and if, I guess--
yeah, if we were me

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.490
and if I was describing this
problem, the one that we work

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.970
out in class, I would
call them points

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.840
because they're on the graph.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.320
They're points.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.515
They're data points.

00:10:55.515 --> 00:10:59.240
But however, in more difficult
versions of this problem

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.760
that have n
dimensions, where n is

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.330
some ridiculous
number of dimensions

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.040
that you're never
going to graph.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.310
Like say some of the
research I'm doing now,

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.060
I could use support
vector machines

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.420
on some of these articles that
I'm reading about cyber events

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.520
to try to figure out
if there's a real event

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.780
or if it's just someone
complaining about how we're

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.540
really vulnerable or
something like that

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.550
and no event actually happened.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:25.820
So the reason why they
call these guys vectors is

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.990
when you're not able to graph
them on a Cartesian plane,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.790
there's still this long vector
of many different dimensions.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.750
Right now, though, these
points represent the vectors.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.134
This is very simple.

00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:40.550
It's easier to
view them this way.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.685
But for instance, that
plus at negative 1, 2

00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:46.060
represents the
fact that there is

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.670
a vector going in the
direction of negative 1, 2

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.415
with a magnitude such that
it reaches negative 1, 2.

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.540
So all these points are
just a point representation

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.180
of a vector.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.400
You probably, in any class
that worked with vectors,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.330
saw this, saw vectors being
represented as points.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.830
Question?

00:12:05.593 --> 00:12:07.865
AUDIENCE: Always from the
respect to the origin?

00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:08.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.680
The question is always
with respect to the origin.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.842
The answer is
canonically, when vectors

00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:15.340
are represented as
points, yes, it's always

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.820
with respect to the origin.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.604
So that's the basic idea is that
all these points are vectors.

00:12:21.604 --> 00:12:22.770
So what are support vectors?

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.400
Well, you could call them
support points for this case.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.191
But the reason we call
them support vectors

00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:28.800
is again, in the
generalized case

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.980
that you might be doing in
the real world with real AI,

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.480
you're going to
have a giant vector.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.560
And it's not just going
to be points on a graph.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.850
Well, usually.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.970
So the support vectors,
the support points,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.000
we found one of them correctly.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.660
It's this guy.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:50.124
They're going to be the
ones that again, they

00:12:50.124 --> 00:12:51.290
don't have an alpha of zero.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:54.740
They're the ones that bind
in the, as Petra calls it,

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.780
the road, the boundary lines.

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.930
They're going to be
on the edge of plus.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.010
Whichever direction
we draw it, this plus

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.616
is the edge of the plus region.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:06.947
If we made this the
edge of the plus region

00:13:06.947 --> 00:13:09.030
and everything on this
side is plus and everything

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.710
on this side is
minus, we'd be screwed

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.170
because there's two pluses
on the other side of that.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.040
Generally, when trying
to find a support vector,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.100
you do something a little bit
similar to my crazy method

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.950
of doing nearest
neighbors, and try

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:30.860
to find a plus-minus pair
that's close to each other.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.650
Sometimes though, it's
not just two points

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.900
because sometimes if you try
to draw the simple-minded

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.760
thing, which is
the perpendicular

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.780
bisector of the two points,
you get screwed because there's

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.800
another point in your way.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.400
So now that I've
given away a clue,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.722
let's go-- and hopefully
that made sense to you guys.

00:13:48.722 --> 00:13:50.805
The support vectors are
the ones on the edges that

00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:53.320
are just barely a plus
for sure, or just barely

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.390
a minus for sure.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.040
Let's go back.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.900
Can you give me a
negative support vector?

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.852
AUDIENCE: The top one?

00:13:57.852 --> 00:13:58.477
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:00.055
AUDIENCE: The top
negative point?

00:14:00.055 --> 00:14:02.380
PROFESSOR: The one
on the top left?

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:02.880
Yes.

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.630
And does anyone think that
there's a third support vector?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.420
Well, let's simple-mindedly
try the thing that-- remember,

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.160
support vectors
always attempt to have

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.470
the widest possible space
between the pluses and minuses

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.600
that they can.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.240
So let's simple-mindedly try to
do the perpendicular bisector

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.380
and see if screws us over.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.050
So when we simple-mindedly do
the perpendicular bisector,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:39.330
it goes through here like this.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.665
And it's just fine.

00:14:41.665 --> 00:14:43.415
So these are the only
two support vectors.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.490
And there's our divider line.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.210
So we're on the home stretch.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.160
But we have to find w and b.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.160
In olden days, we would find
w and b by plugging in w dot

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.130
the plus support
vector, plus b equals 1.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.600
Oh, that's very crucial.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.800
These w dot x plus
x minus are only

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.780
true equaling 1 or negative 1?

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.540
Or only true for
support vectors?

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.630
It's always true that w dot
any positive point plus b will

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.520
be some positive number.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.730
But it won't always be 1.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.870
In fact, it will always be
greater than 1 up over here.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.275
It will always be less
than -1 down over there.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:53.330
In olden days, we would plug
in -1, 2 into this equation.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.670
We would plug in 3,
-2 into this equation.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.557
We'd plug in alpha plus equals
alpha minus in its sums.

00:16:00.557 --> 00:16:02.140
And since there's
only 1 plus 1 minus,

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.030
we'd know they were equal.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.440
And then we'd fidget around
with this w equation.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.880
However, there is a
better way to do it.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.720
And so let's use
this cheap strategy

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.310
to solve this
version of the SVM.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.180
Here's how.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.730
First, and I know I didn't
draw these completely straight.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.030
Sorry.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.060
But can anyone, by looking
at-- this is three, -2.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.150
2 And this is -1, 2.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.680
Can anyone tell me what
the equation-- you can do y

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.720
equals mx plus b.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.011
Can anyone tell me what the
equation of the dotted line

00:16:38.011 --> 00:16:40.354
is supposed to be if
I was good at drawing?

00:16:40.354 --> 00:16:42.764
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:46.138
PROFESSOR: People say
y equals x minus 1.

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:50.100
And I say yes, y
equals x minus 1.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.800
So therefore, the
pluses would be

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.330
y is greater than or
equal to x minus 1 indeed.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:02.710
So we've already seen that
w dot x plus b somehow can

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:05.640
be converted into this form.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.480
Right?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.730
So therefore, if we
have y equals x minus 1,

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:19.490
then we know that we have we
have w dot x plus b equals 0.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.250
Let's do that here.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:28.730
So we know that w1 x1.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.450
We can even call it x and y.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.170
I think it'll be fine.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.720
No one will come after us.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.160
w2 y plus b equals 0.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.770
But we also know that
y equals x minus 1,

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:48.060
which means that if
y equals x minus 1,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.310
then according to this
thing we have over here,

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:57.915
then negative w1
over w2 equals--

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:12.340
So we know that negative w1 over
w2-- and we have -b over w2.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.960
So y equals x minus 1.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.330
And if we solve this equation
to make it look like this,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:29.220
we would have y equals negative
w1 over w2 Minus b over w2.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:37.920
So we know that in some way,
shape, or form-- we know that

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:43.100
then therefore, w1
over w2 is some scalar

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.900
multiple of minus 1.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:53.280
And we know that b over w2
is, in fact, some scalar

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.910
multiple of positive 1.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.660
Scalar multiple, what's
a scalar multiple?

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.410
Well, why is it a
scalar multiple?

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.520
Why isn't it just going to
be negative 1 or positive 1?

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.530
Just because in
this equation, we

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:11.284
can multiply the entire
equation by any number

00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:13.200
and it will still have
the same boundary line.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.255
You guys see that?

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:22.320
Oh, there's an x here.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.170
If we multiplied everything,
since it's all divided by w2.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:31.310
If we double w2, but
also doubled b and w1,

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.125
it would be the
exact same equation.

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.010
Do you guys agree?

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.356
So there's, in fact, infinitely
many possible equations.

00:19:37.356 --> 00:19:38.480
You say, well, great, Mark.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.450
You've figured out
what form it is.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.260
So you figured out
that w1 over w2

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.040
equals some scalar
multiple of negative 1.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.600
So it's negative
1 times-- what's

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.446
everyone's favorite letter?

00:19:55.446 --> 00:19:56.179
AUDIENCE: k.

00:19:56.179 --> 00:19:56.720
PROFESSOR: k.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.440
Negative 1 times k.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:05.180
And we figured out
that b over w2 is--

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.320
I guess we can just do
negative -- is positive k.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.000
But what's k?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.416
How are we going
to figure it out?

00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:11.600
Well, it's a good question.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.600
And I will tell you how.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.090
I will assert the following
fact as true without proof.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.320
Then I will not prove it.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.640
1 over the magnitude of w,
which is this vector here

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:36.300
with w1 and w2,
equals this where

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.720
this is that line that I
just drew, the line from here

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.870
to this point.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.840
1 over the magnitude
of w equals this.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.970
Therefore, since 1 over the
magnitude of w equals this,

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.250
and this equals, I
believe, 2 root 2,

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:03.550
because we're going
over to, down to,

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.200
Pythagorean Theorem, 2, root 2.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.760
So therefore, flip
everything over.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.740
Magnitude of w equals
1 over 2 root 2.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.430
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals root 2 over 4.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.130
But why are we OK?

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.900
Well, how do we calculate
the magnitude of w?

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.560
Do people know, in general,
magnitudes of vectors?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.720
Generally, for these
vectors, we do it

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.990
by the square root of the sum
of the components squared.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:49.290
So the square root of w1
squared plus w2 squared

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:50.300
equals root 2 over 4.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.610
But that's not all.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:22:00.710
That's not all, we say, because
we know from this over here

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.412
that the ratio of w1 and w2 is--

00:22:04.412 --> 00:22:07.090
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:13.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
ratio of w1 and w2

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.340
is going to be--
actually, sorry.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.150
I shouldn't put a k here.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.490
I realize I probably have
been confusing you guys a lot.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.475
w1 over w2 is just -1.

00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:27.510
B Over w2 is just 1.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:29.570
That's just a fact.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.600
There's no k.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.630
The k is to determine
what w1 and w2 are.

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:38.403
So w1 equals -k.

00:22:38.403 --> 00:22:41.760
And w2 equals positive k.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.156
And b equals also positive k.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.790
By the way, here's
a question for you.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:54.830
Could I have put the
negative sign on w2 and b

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:55.860
instead of on w1?

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.970
So many people said yes.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.250
That's a very smart answer.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.080
Actually, no,
because of the fact

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.270
that the pluses are on
the negative x-axis.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.402
It's just a little
trick I picked up.

00:23:11.402 --> 00:23:13.902
When one of them is negative
and the other one isn't, follow

00:23:13.902 --> 00:23:15.400
the pluses.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.620
So we know that w1 is
-k, w2 is positive k,

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:20.196
and b Is positive k.

00:23:20.196 --> 00:23:22.455
w1 over w2 is -1.

00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:24.700
b over w2 is positive 1.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.460
So what do we know about
the ratio of w1 and w2?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.720
It's equal to -1.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.810
And that means that
when we square it,

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.290
w1 squared equals w2 squared.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.720
So therefore, this
is the square root

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:46.540
of 2 w1 squared, which
equals root 2 w1.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.460
Well, actually no, it
doesn't equal root 2 w1

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.340
because w1 is actually negative.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.420
So it's negative root 2 w1.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.430
It doesn't matter.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:09.100
The point is that if that
equals root 2 over 4,

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.042
then w1 is-- everyone?

00:24:12.042 --> 00:24:13.000
AUDIENCE: Negative 1/4.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.210
PROFESSOR: Negative 1/4.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.042
Bingo.

00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:18.690
And if w1 is -1/4, 1 everything
else falls into place.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:19.630
What are w2 and b?

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:20.460
Everyone?

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.600
AUDIENCE: Positive 1/4.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.720
PROFESSOR: Positive 1/4.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.600
We got it.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.720
We're done with this
part of problem.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.210
However, bonus.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:28.800
Let's come to the
alphas, which they

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.420
didn't ask you to calculate.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.719
Actually, you know what?

00:24:31.719 --> 00:24:33.510
We'll do the alphas if
we have enough time,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.718
since they didn't actually
ask you to calculate them.

00:24:35.718 --> 00:24:38.240
However, my recommendation
is since there's only

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.040
one alpha-plus and
one alpha-minus,

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.570
they must be equal
from this equation,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.010
since the sum of the alpha-plus
equals the sum of alpha-minus.

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:54.030
And so therefore, w equals
the sum of w-- sorry,

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.520
this should be an x.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.980
Of course, there's not a
million w's in this equation.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:02.912
The sum of the positive data
points times their alpha

00:25:02.912 --> 00:25:05.490
is minus the negative data
points times their alphas.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:14.550
So we're looking at here
-1/4, 1/4 equals-- what

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.180
do we got here?

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.110
Positive point negative 1, 2?

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:27.020
So we've got alpha, alpha of
that point negative 1, 2 minus

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.750
alpha of that minus point.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.890
And what is that?

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:30.790
It's 3, -2.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.690
3, -2.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.370
So if both of the alphas
which are equal were 1,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.440
we'd have -4, 4.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.220
But we want -1/4, 1/4.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:53.070
So actually both of
the alphas are 1/16.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.340
And that's the answer.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.370
We'll do that more in
depth if we have time.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.300
But we won't.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.530
So let's do number two.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.550
So let's go into faster mode.

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:06.780
Number two, very similar
to number one in many ways.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.680
But as you can see, one of the
main things that they added

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.800
an extra minus sign at 2, -1.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.890
So I think we can all
agree that this will still

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.560
be our plus-- Actually, they
added another plus sign there,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.470
too.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.060
So maybe this plus sign
is a support vector.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.870
But it's not.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.496
This plus sign is
a support vector.

00:26:26.496 --> 00:26:28.620
What do you guys think
about the new negative sign?

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.100
Will it become a support
vector since it is strictly

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.370
closer to the pluses?

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.460
Yep, you're right.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:41.080
OK, so this is a very
beautiful division

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.580
because if I do this correctly,
which I didn't, but if we

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.980
pretend that I did.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:48.445
Then the dotted line is--

00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:49.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.805
PROFESSOR: y equals x.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.780
OK, so with the dotted
line at y equals x, then

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:11.800
just like we did up here, we
know that if y equals x plus 0,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.700
we know that first
of all, b equals 0.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:22.550
Second of all, we know
that if y equals x, then

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:27.940
we know that -w1
over w2 equals 1.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.910
The pluses are still
on the left and up,

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.364
so we know that w1 is
some negative number, -k,

00:27:40.364 --> 00:27:43.580
and w2 is some
positive number k.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.390
Great.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.480
How are we going
to figure it out?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.020
Well, let's call
this d for distance,

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.710
or whatever you want to call it.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.300
So 1 over w equals d.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.860
d In this case is not 2 over 2.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.270
Can everyone tell
what d is here?

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.226
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.700
PROFESSOR: It's actually--
so it goes over 2 and 1.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:23.820
So it should be 1 1/2 root
2 since this width distance,

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.420
which is twice as much,
goes over 3 and 3,

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.650
which is 3 root 2.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.780
So it's 1 1/2 root 2.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.170
I don't like putting in
decimals and stuff there.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.820
So we'll say that 2
over magnitude of w

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:45.630
equals 2d equals 3 root 2.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:49.510
So therefore, right,
Pythagorean, one, two, three,

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.310
one, two, three, 3 root 2.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:59.300
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals-- let's see.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.040
Switch them over.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.330
We should get root 2 over 3.

00:29:05.026 --> 00:29:07.230
And if magnitude of
w is root 2 over 3,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:10.420
we can do our same
trick from before,

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:16.630
square root of 2 w2 squared
equals root 2 over 3.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:26.250
And this is just root 2 times
w2 equals root 2 over 3.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.650
So therefore, w2 is?

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.240
1/3.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.430
And w1 is?

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.250
-1/3.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.370
Bingo.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.730
We've got w1.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.980
We've got w2.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.960
We know that b was zero
because obviously it's 0.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.300
It's y equals x.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.940
And we're done.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.040
That was fast.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.340
The alphas might taken longer.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.923
Actually, the alphas on this one
are more of a pain in the ass

00:29:47.923 --> 00:29:51.030
than anywhere else because
let's take a look at this one

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.770
if you can see it.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.850
We've added in yet
some new points.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.100
We've got this point up here
and this point down there.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.640
So I think pretty clearly
this plus and minus

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.906
are the closest to each other.

00:30:01.906 --> 00:30:03.780
But what happens if we
take the perpendicular

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.200
bisector between these
two and do like this?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.194
This plus is in the middle.

00:30:12.194 --> 00:30:13.860
So therefore, this
plus is going to have

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.540
to also be a support vector.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:20.090
So we can't just draw this line.

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:21.810
We have to include this.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.040
What's our best division?

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.800
Vertical lines, that's right.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:34.252
Vertical lines just so.

00:30:34.252 --> 00:30:39.100
And that means that the
equation of our boundary,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.085
the dotted line here, y-axis.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.695
So the equation of the boundary
with the y-axis, then b

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:50.770
equals 0.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.490
And hell, w2 equals 0.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.860
So the only thing that is not--

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.770
AUDIENCE: Wait, w1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.077
PROFESSOR: w2 equals 0.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.560
So w2 equals 0.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.490
b equals 0.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:12.420
But w1 is not equal to
zero because it's just

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.070
the equation of the y-axis.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:21.270
So we therefore know
that the equation is just

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:25.980
w1 times x equals 0.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.400
So it's w1 times x equals 0.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.470
And we know that that
just means essentially

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:39.777
that x is going to be some k.

00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:41.860
It's also going to be
negative because of the fact

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.400
that the pluses are
still on the left.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.610
Then we're going to have to
figure out what that k is.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:51.500
We'll use our old trick-- by
this point old, hopefully.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.060
One over magnitude
of w equals d.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.280
This time d is just 1.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.050
So therefore, magnitude
of w equals 1.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.450
There's only one component in w.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.000
So therefore w1 is

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.360
AUDIENCE: -1.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.330
PROFESSOR: -1 because
the plus is on the left.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.900
Do people see that?

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.810
Not too bad.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:16.563
This one's easy to
calculate the w.

00:32:16.563 --> 00:32:20.460
But it's not as easy
to get all the alphas.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.740
But let's move on to
a new and even more

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:30.920
fun-- maybe not-- question,
which is this guy.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.100
As you can see-- well maybe not.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.960
This is a one
dimensional vector.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.970
These vectors only have
a single dimension.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.380
So it just looks like
a number line here.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.610
That dimension varies from it
looks like -9 to positive 9.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.247
It just has one component.

00:32:48.247 --> 00:32:50.705
You don't have to worry about
any of these crazy magnitudes

00:32:50.705 --> 00:32:53.530
with two components,
just everything

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.100
as a single component.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:59.300
However, it's obvious
that a linear basis

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.890
line is going to completely
screw us up here,

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:05.090
since lines at this point
are just like, grunk,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:06.024
all these are pluses.

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:06.940
All these are minuses.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.860
Well, great, that
doesn't get them all.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.570
So how are we going to do it?

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.180
Well, we're going to use what
is usually perhaps the hardest

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.180
thing in SVMs, but
in this case is not

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.010
going to be too bad for us.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:19.520
We're going to use a kernel.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.160
Now, based on how little
I understood kernels

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.320
the first time I
took this class,

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.970
I'm guessing that
you guys would like

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.714
to have some explanation
on these kernels.

00:33:30.714 --> 00:33:31.630
You probably saw them.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.070
You remember the kernels from
Patrick's lecture vaguely?

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.120
There's this phi.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.160
And then there's this k.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.730
And then they get
really complicated.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.420
OK, so here's how
the kernel works.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.660
The basic idea is this.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:51.420
And I'll write it over here.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.030
Oh, wow, there's more stuff.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:53.739
OK.

00:33:53.739 --> 00:33:54.780
I'll write it right here.

00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:56.730
The basic idea is this.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:01.910
We're taking the normal space,
which is this number line

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.100
or it could be any
kind of normal space,

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.100
and we're going
to take a vector,

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.230
we're going to put into
it a function called phi.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:16.120
And phi of vector x brings
x into some new dimension.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.659
Phi, or "phee" if
you like it better,

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.400
is usually a nasty piece
of work and something

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.929
you never, ever want to look at.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.820
Sometimes it's not too bad.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.679
Phi is the function that brings
it into the new dimension.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.224
OK?

00:34:29.224 --> 00:34:31.570
And when you brought the
data into a new dimension,

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.070
sometimes you can just cut a
straight line in that dimension

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.699
and you'll just be happy.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:42.159
However, something
that was noted

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:48.449
by the very, very smart inventor
of support vector machines

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:54.710
is that you don't actually
need to work with function phi,

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.740
even if phi is an absolutely
horrible monstrosity, because

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:04.850
of the fact that you never need
to know what all these vectors

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:10.400
x actually are in the new
space, at least not directly.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.930
In none of these
equations up here

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.720
do we ever use x by itself.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.440
However, we do use x being dot
product with something else.

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.780
So he figured out a very
sneaky and excellent shortcut.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.510
OK, so-- oh, I
shouldn't use x1 and x2.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:35.530
I'll use x and z.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.910
So if you have two
vectors, x and z, which

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.140
are in a regular
space, you put them

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.650
into this function
called the kernel.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:55.120
Then it will tell you
phi x dotted with phi z.

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.920
And if you have that,
you don't need phi.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.934
Does everyone see that?

00:36:00.934 --> 00:36:02.600
Does everyone see why
we don't need phi?

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.099
Look at all these
equations up here.

00:36:04.099 --> 00:36:07.770
We have never looked
at x by itself

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.390
in these vector
equations at least.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.610
Now, calculating alphas, yeah,
that gets a little bit fuzzy.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.240
Also, you may ask,
why would you do this?

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.720
You can't calculate the alphas.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:29.200
It turns out that actually,
other than for these very

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.800
simple linear problems,
human minds cannot calculate

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.740
the alphas.

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:35.827
In fact, you run
a very complicated

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:36.785
quadratic optimization.

00:36:36.785 --> 00:36:39.090
In fact, finding
out the best alphas

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.720
is the thing that you
hill climb on when you're

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.440
doing SVMs in the real world.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.075
You say, all right,
I'll run my algorithm

00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:48.770
when I know there's
only one peak, which

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.430
is very, very good because
it's quadratic optimization.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.080
Let me figure out the alphas.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.010
So in fact, it doesn't
matter that you

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:00.359
can't use these alpha equations
to figure out the alphas if you

00:37:00.359 --> 00:37:01.900
only know the kernel
function and not

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.280
the phi function because
normally, the computer

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.166
figures out the alphas for you
with quadratic optimization.

00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:10.540
Just in these
simple problems, we

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.400
know you can
calculate the alphas.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.120
So we have the kernel,
which basically gives us

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.500
the dot product of the
things in the new space.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.200
So being that as it may, I'll
give you the kernel here.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.410
I'd like you give me phi.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.670
Someone got an idea, whose
name was Susan Q. Random

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.360
Student, apparently.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.980
She got an idea that if we had
a kernel for x and z-- actually,

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.210
they're not vectors, I guess.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:43.430
There just single components.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:55.500
And the kernel equals cosine Pi
over 4x times cosine Pi over 4

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:07.260
z plus sine Pi over 4x
plus sine Pi over 4z.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.670
So that is the new dot product.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.090
Oh, wait, sorry.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:21.030
I put one of the z's not
inside the parentheses.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.340
That was silly of me.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:28.220
So cosine of the
quantity pi Over 4x times

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.300
cosine of the quantity Pi over
4z plus sine of quantity Pi

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.480
over 4x plus sine of quantity
Pi over 4z is the new product.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.910
So that begs the question.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:42.150
This is an easy one so
we can calculate the phi.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:47.620
What is phi of x?

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.025
We're actually taking
it from one dimension

00:38:51.025 --> 00:38:53.890
and we may be playing around
with it a lot to get this.

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:56.910
And this thing has
become a new dot product.

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.532
It replaces dot product.

00:38:58.532 --> 00:39:00.240
And remember, the dot
product for scalars

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.750
would have just been multiplying
two numbers together.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.000
So it actually makes it a
little bit more complicated.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.650
Does anyone think
they know the phi?

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:08.930
Oh, we got one.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.896
What do you think?

00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:10.888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.228
PROFESSOR: You mean two common
vectors, two dimensional?

00:39:16.228 --> 00:39:17.540
AUDIENCE: The two points.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.040
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.550
That's exactly correct.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:25.310
How would you have solved
this on the actual quiz

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.900
if you're not our
brave volunteer?

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:34.330
Well, that k, if you squint at
it-- not very much actually--

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:40.200
is pretty much a dot product
between cosine of Pi over 4

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.570
and sine Pi over 4.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.070
I mean, look at it.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:48.310
Remember, if the dot
product of x and z vectors

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:56.550
is x1, z1 plus x2, z2-- so that
basically is x1, z1 plus x2 z2.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:59.490
Oh, this should
have been a times.

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.190
Yeah, this should
have been a times.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.770
Sorry.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.090
There's a plus there.

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:05.807
Anyone who missed it
because of that, my bad.

00:40:05.807 --> 00:40:07.140
That's should have been a times.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.080
That should have been
a times up there.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.580
It's cosine Pi over 4x cosine
Pi over 4z plus sine Pi

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.260
over 4x times sine Pi over 4z.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.040
So yeah, it's basically
the dot product

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.420
between cosine Pi over
4x and sine Pi over 4x.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.930
Bingo.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.177
All right, last thing.

00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:26.010
Well, we're not done
yet because we're going

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.399
to maybe ask some questions.

00:40:27.399 --> 00:40:29.940
And then we're going to see if
we can calculate those alphas.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.850
But last thing, let's
graph in this new dimension

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:35.610
all the points.

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:40.330
So obviously, cosines
and sines, so we're

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.050
going to get results
between 1 and -1.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:44.550
Let's see.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:52.280
Maybe I can graph it--
did I write on all these?

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.060
Wait, maybe this one.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.730
No, people drew weird
stick figures there.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.230
OK.

00:41:05.092 --> 00:41:06.550
Oh, yeah, this
one's kind of messy.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:08.980
But we'll do it on this.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:26.400
OK, so this is 1, -1, 1/2,
-1/2, 1, -1, -1/2, 1/2.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.460
OK?

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.140
So given that,
let's try to graph

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.110
all these points
on this number line

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:38.740
into this brave new dimension
by using their cosine times

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.830
Pi over 4.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.660
So all right, great.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.920
So let's do the pluses first.

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.110
The plus at 0 is
cosine 0, sine 0.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.170
So what is that?

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:53.202
AUDIENCE: 1, 0.

00:41:53.202 --> 00:41:54.160
PROFESSOR: That's 1, 0.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:54.790
That's right.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:08.140
In fact, the 8 and the
-8 are also that times 3.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:10.340
The 8 and the -8 are also
that because then it's

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.300
just 2 Pi minus 2 Pi, which both
cosine and sine are periodic.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.740
OK, great.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.600
What about the 1?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.130
Well, that's cosine Pi
over 4, sine Pi over 4.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:22.015
And what's that?

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.700
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's root
2 over 2, root 2 over 2.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:33.950
So that's something
like here, we'll say.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:42.320
And in fact, and the 9
and the -7 are also that.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.570
So there's three of these two.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:48.640
What about the -1?

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.554
That's cosine negative pi
over 4, sine Pi over 4.

00:42:55.422 --> 00:42:57.040
AUDIENCE: [SEVERAL ANSWERS]

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:02.780
The x value is
positive root 2 over 2.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.660
And the y value is negative.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.070
And again, there's
three of them.

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:10.520
All right, great.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.910
Now let's do the minuses.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:14.840
There's the minus
at 3, which is also

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.110
the same as the minus at -7.

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:20.260
The minus at 3 is cosine 3
Pi over 4, sine 3 Pi over 4.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.035
Which one is that?

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's going
to be in the second quadrant.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:37.010
The cosine is going
to be negative.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.870
But the sine is
going to be positive.

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.260
And so we get 3 points here.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:48.730
And as you may have predicted,
the other one, the 5 Pi over 4,

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:50.980
is in the third quadrant.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:56.044
We get 3 points here, Where
are the support vectors?

00:44:01.852 --> 00:44:03.304
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:44:03.304 --> 00:44:04.756
PROFESSOR: Question?

00:44:04.756 --> 00:44:06.934
AUDIENCE: I understand
where you're

00:44:06.934 --> 00:44:09.418
getting at the three
quantities of pluses

00:44:09.418 --> 00:44:11.314
in the first of the quadrants.

00:44:11.314 --> 00:44:13.684
But according to the
[INAUDIBLE] line there,

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.959
you want that the total of
four-- maybe the values.

00:44:15.959 --> 00:44:17.125
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right.

00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:18.795
There's only two.

00:44:18.795 --> 00:44:20.250
Good call.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.739
There's two negatives here.

00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:23.030
And there's two negatives here.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.700
Good call.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.977
It doesn't change the problem.

00:44:25.977 --> 00:44:27.560
In fact, if we just
graph more points,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.684
there might have been more.

00:44:28.684 --> 00:44:30.940
But that's a very subtle
and important distinction.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.860
There are two negatives.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.780
But otherwise, yeah, these
are graphed correctly.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.714
Does anyone see where
the support vectors are?

00:44:39.714 --> 00:44:42.199
AUDIENCE: The first two.

00:44:42.199 --> 00:44:44.187
AUDIENCE: Maybe the top two.

00:44:44.187 --> 00:44:46.449
PROFESSOR:So the top
two, the minus and plus.

00:44:46.449 --> 00:44:48.240
We'll try to do the
perpendicular bisector.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.460
Let's see it.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.100
That works.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:56.880
But guess what?

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.700
These guys are on the same line.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.350
So we'd better circle them.

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.410
So actually, the question is
what isn't a support vector?

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.170
Only this.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.050
Only those three.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.997
Question?

00:45:06.997 --> 00:45:09.496
AUDIENCE: Couldn't you have
just done this in one dimension?

00:45:09.496 --> 00:45:14.406
I mean, you just showed that
those ran on the same lines.

00:45:14.406 --> 00:45:16.861
So you really didn't need the
cosine term and a sine term.

00:45:16.861 --> 00:45:19.314
You could have proved all
this with just the cosine.

00:45:19.314 --> 00:45:20.730
PROFESSOR: All
right, the question

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.840
is couldn't we have done
this in one dimension.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.800
All we do is only the cosine.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.910
So if we did only
the cosine, then they

00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.470
would've still been
easily divisible.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.650
The answer is,
absolutely, we could have.

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.170
However, the question did not
because Susan Q. Random Student

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.950
decided to do cosine and sine.

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.740
But yes, if we had said
you, [INAUDIBLE] student,

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.940
find a phi that
will work for this,

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.230
you could have found a
phi that was just cosine.

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:53.860
That would have been easier.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:56.930
However, it's important to
be a little work with what

00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:57.930
somebody else gives you.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.634
In this case, they gave you
that transformation, which yeah,

00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:03.175
was wasteful with
an extra dimension.

00:46:03.175 --> 00:46:05.630
You didn't need the
sine because you didn't

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:09.240
need the y-axis really here.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.235
You just needed the x.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.030
Does everyone see
this, how this works?

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.970
You can maybe
transform dimensions?

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:20.542
The main hardest part is
they'll usually give you a k

00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:22.850
and ask for a phi or give
you a phi and ask for a k.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.700
But it's not too bad.

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.520
Just remember, if
they give you a phi,

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.190
do a dot product with it.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.650
And if they give
you a phi that's

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.820
just one component, dot
product of one component,

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.290
just multiply them together.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:34.930
Easy enough.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:37.994
If they give you a k,
treat it as a dot product

00:46:37.994 --> 00:46:39.160
and try to reverse engineer.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.784
It's usually something
like this that's

00:46:40.784 --> 00:46:42.200
easy to reverse engineer.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.240
I really haven't seen
it where it's not.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.370
So it often looks like
the scariest problem.

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:51.690
But it's usually not too bad
to go between phis and k's.

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.660
Does anyone have any
questions on anything

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:59.646
that we did on support
vector machines?

00:46:59.646 --> 00:47:01.594
Question.

00:47:01.594 --> 00:47:04.029
AUDIENCE: So what's the
intuition behind the w?

00:47:04.029 --> 00:47:06.451
We solved it and figured
out numbers and integrations

00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:06.951
with it.

00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:08.671
But what is it in relation to--

00:47:08.671 --> 00:47:10.420
PROFESSOR: Question
is, what is intuition?

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.976
What is w?

00:47:12.976 --> 00:47:14.980
W Is the dividing line.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.996
It is the drop
dead dividing line.

00:47:16.996 --> 00:47:18.620
When I say the drop
dead dividing line,

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.960
you like those big, bold
solid lines over there.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:23.680
Those are your
pretty certain lines.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.057
Everything past
that was a minus.

00:47:25.057 --> 00:47:26.640
In your training,
it's that everything

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.150
past the big bold line there was
a plus in your training stuff.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.290
But the dotted line is
the one you're really

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.350
going to use in the test data.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.770
In the test data, when
push comes to shove,

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.910
you might get something if
it's inside of that gutter.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.879
And if it's on the,
say, of that one

00:47:41.879 --> 00:47:44.420
up there, if it's on the upper
left side of that dotted line,

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.040
you're going to call it a plus.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:49.870
So that dotted line is
your decision boundary.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.010
And that is basically the idea.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:56.952
And in fact, the way that
the algorithm would do it

00:47:56.952 --> 00:47:58.660
on the computer is it
would quadratically

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.430
optimize the alphas,
which messes around

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:02.610
with the dotted line.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.230
And by quadratically
maximizing the alphas-- you see

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:07.884
how the alphas add up to a w.

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:08.925
It just checks it around.

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:12.519
And eventually, it finds, oh,
making the alpha of this one 0

00:48:12.519 --> 00:48:13.810
makes it a better optimization.

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.980
You're trying to get the
widest possible road.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:17.715
It would eventually
come out to this.

00:48:17.715 --> 00:48:19.340
This is trivial for
a human to eyeball.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.500
But some real
problems with 200 data

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.720
points that have to get one or
two of them wrong, classified,

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.960
and you may be using a
quadratic kernel or something

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.500
that, you can't do that.

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:30.510
You just can't.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:32.930
Well, maybe can,
in which case you

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.782
should be getting a
MacArthur Fellowship

00:48:34.782 --> 00:48:35.740
or something like that.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.310
But the computer can.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:40.680
And the basic idea is
when it comes down to it,

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.860
it figures out the alphas, that
the best w for the widest road.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:47.410
And the w s your
decision boundary.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.620
Good question.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.270
Any other questions about
our old friend, SVM?

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:54.250
I have a question for you.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.090
After seeing this-- and
let's pretend that they only

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.065
asked to solve for w's, b's,
these kind of kernels and phi,

00:49:01.065 --> 00:49:03.810
which are the typical
things-- how many people now

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:10.030
think that you can go through
and work an SVM problem?

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.270
All right, we've got a few.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.250
We've got a happy few.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.150
Band of brothers.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.980
Maybe eight people
raised their hand there.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.010
That's good.

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:21.630
How many people know what
a support vector is now?

00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:22.635
That's really good.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.410
Because if that's all
you learned from today's

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.300
recitation, it's still good.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.130
It really is.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:33.800
I'm telling you.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.360
I had to take two classes on
this and then TA it before I

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.800
really, really understood it.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.660
So you guys are ahead of me.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.790
All right, take care.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.340
Have a great weekend.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:51.390
And we'll see you for boosting
and vampires next week.
