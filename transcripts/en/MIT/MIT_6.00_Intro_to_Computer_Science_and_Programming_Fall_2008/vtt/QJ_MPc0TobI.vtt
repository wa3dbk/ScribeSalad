00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.490
PROFESSOR: You'll recall, at
least some of you will recall,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.410
that last time we ended up
looking at a simulation of a

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.320
drunken university student
wandering randomly in a field.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.300
I'm going to return to that.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.740
Before I get to the interesting
part, I do want to

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.410
call your attention to something
that some people

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.990
seemed a little bit confused
by last time.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.900
So you remember that
we had this thing

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.500
called perform trial.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.550
And the way we basically tested
the drunk, what would

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.340
happen, is we would call this,
passing in a time, the number

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.970
of steps, the amount of time
that the drunk was wondering,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.580
and the field.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.170
And there was just 1 line, that
I blazed past, probably

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.430
too quickly.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.200
So what that line is saying, is
we, from the field, we're

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.990
going to call the method get
drunk, which is going to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.130
return us a drunk.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.370
And then we're going to call
the move method for that

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.150
drunk, passing the field
as an argument.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.200
Now the question is, what would
have happened if I had

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.210
left off these parentheses?

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.270
There.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.540
A volunteer?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.190
What would, we will do the
experiment in a minute.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.680
And by the way, I want to
emphasize the importance of

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.370
experimentation.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.080
I was kind of surprised, for
example, to get email from

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.140
people saying, well, what was
the correct answer to question

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.150
3 on the quiz?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.340
And my sort of response
was, why don't you

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.400
type it and find out?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.920
When in doubt, run
the experiment.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.170
So, what's going to happen, what
would have happened, had

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.100
I failed to type that
pair of parentheses?

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.560
Anybody?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.050
Well, what is, get drunk?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.430
It is a method.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.510
And remember, in Python,
methods, like classes, are

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.500
themselves objects.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.380
So get drunk would have a
returned an object which was a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:10.340
method, and then, well,
let's try it.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.820
And the error message
will tell us

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.930
everything we need to know.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.200
Function has no attribute
move.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.610
Sure enough, the method does
not have an attribute move.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.930
The instance of the class
has the attribute.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:37.340
And so what those parentheses
did, was tell me to invoke the

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.800
method get drunk, so now instead
of that being the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.820
method itself, it's the result
returned by the method.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.090
Which is an instance of class
drunk, and that instance has

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.190
an attribute move, which
is itself a method.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.330
This is a very common
programming paradigm, and it's

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.380
important to sort of lock into
your heads, the distinction

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.050
between the method and an
invocation of the method.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.740
Because you can write either,
and sometimes you won't get an

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.320
error message, you'll just
get the wrong answer.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.620
And that's kind of bad.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.890
That make sense to everybody?

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.660
Does it not make sense to
anybody, maybe is the question

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.050
I should ask?

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.210
All right, we'll go on, and
we'll see more examples of

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.820
this kind of thing.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.370
Now last week, I ran this
several times to see what

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.300
would happen, and we saw that
in fact contrary to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.200
everyone's, most everyone's,
expectation, the longer we ran

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.570
the simulation, the further
the drunk was from the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.780
starting point.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.920
And we saw that by plotting how
far the drunk was after

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.200
each time unit.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.290
We ran it several times, we
got different answers.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.620
And at that point we should ask
ourselves, is that really

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.320
the way to go about answering
the original question?

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.720
Which was, how far should we
expect the drunk to be?

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.880
The answer is no.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.370
I don't want to sit there at
the keyboard typing in 400

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.480
examples and then, in my head,
trying to figure out what's

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.050
quote, typical, unquote.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.390
Instead, I need to organize my
simulation so that it runs a

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:42.490
number of trials for me and
summarizes the results.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.290
All the simulations we're going
to look at it, in fact

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.010
almost all the simulations
anyone will ever write, sort

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.490
of, have the same kind
of structure.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:14.610
We start with an inner loop
that simulates one trial.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.090
That's what we have here, right,
we have happen to have

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.610
a function.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.840
So when I say inner loop, what I
mean is, not that I'll write

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.320
a program a bunch of nested
loops, but that I'll write a

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.390
program with some function
calls, and down at sort of the

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:36.430
bottom of the stack will
be perform trial.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.830
Which stimulates one trial
of some number of

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:46.900
seconds, in this case.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:07:04.320
And then I'll quote, enclose,
unquote the inner loop in

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:25.650
another loop that conducts an
appropriate number of trials.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.070
Now a little bit later in the
term, we'll get to the

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.900
question of, how do we know what
an appropriate number is?

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.520
For today, we'll just
say, a lot.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.080
And we'll talk about that
a little bit more.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:55.750
And then finally, what we want
to do, is calculate and

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:07.600
present some relevant statistics
about the trials.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.410
And we'll talk about
what's relevant.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:17.030
I want to emphasize today the
presentation of them.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.850
Last time we looked at a graph,
which I think you'll

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.430
all agree, was a lot prettier
to look at an array of, say,

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:33.630
1000 numbers.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.920
All right.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:41.460
So now, on your handout and on
the screen, you'll see the way

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.460
we've done this.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.580
So perform trial, we've already
seen, so we know what

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.210
the inner loop looks like.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.100
We can ignore first test, that
was just my taking the code

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.240
that I had in line last time and
putting it in a function.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.470
And now what you'll see in the
handout is perform sim and

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.380
answer question.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.570
So, let's look it those.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.880
So perform sim, sim for
simulation, takes the amount

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.850
of time, the number of steps
for each trial, plus the

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.590
number of trials.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.590
It starts with an empty list,
dist short for distances here,

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.390
saying so far we haven't run any
trials, we don't know what

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.970
any of the distances are.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.600
And then for trial in range
number of trials, it creates a

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:50.930
drunk, and I'm putting the trial
as part of the drunk's

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.450
name, just so we can
make sure that the

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.070
drunks are all different.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.780
Then I'm going to create a field
with that drunk in it at

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.900
location 0,0.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.630
And then I'm going to call
perform trial with the time in

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:14.430
that field to get
the distances.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:22.960
What does perform
trial return?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.070
We looked at it earlier.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.160
What is perform trial
returning?

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.670
Somebody?

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.280
Surely someone can figure
this one out.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.710
I have a whole new bag of candy
here, post-Halloween.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.320
What kind of thing
is it returning?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.150
Is it returning a number?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:52.090
If you think it's returning a
number, oh, ok, you gonna tell

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.870
me what kind of thing it's
returning, please?

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.450
A list, thank you.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.370
And it's a list of what?

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.670
I'm giving you the candy on
spec, assuming you'll give me

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.990
the right answer.

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:10.380
List of distances, exactly.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.000
So how far way it is after
each time step?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.320
This is exactly the list that
we graphed last time.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.000
So perform sim will get that
list and append it to the

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.020
list. So dist list will be a
list of lists, each element

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.540
will be a list of distances,
right?

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.110
OK, so that's good.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:50.650
And that's now step 2.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:54.730
In some sense, all of this is
irrelevant to the actual

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.350
question we started with,
in some sense.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.590
This is just the structure.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.420
Then I'm going to write a
function called answer

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.430
question, or ans quest, designed
to actually address

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.020
the original question.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.560
So it, too, is going to
create a list. This is

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.350
a list called means.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.120
Then it's going to call perform
sim, to get this list

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:35.470
of lists, then it will go
through that and calculate the

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.290
means and create a
list of means.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.080
And then it will plot it, and
we'll get to, before this

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.890
lecture's over, how the
plotting works.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.150
So I'm following exactly
that structure here.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:55.890
It calls this function, which
runs an appropriate number of

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.890
trials by calling that function,
and then we'll

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.850
calculate and present
some statistics.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:11.240
So now let's run it.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.530
All right, so what
have I done?

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.840
I typed an inadvertent chara --
ah, yes, I typed an s which

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:30.400
I didn't intend to type.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.870
It's going to take a little
while, it's loading Pylab.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.780
Now it's running
the simulation.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:43.230
All right, and here's
a picture.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:50.820
So, when we ran it, let's look
at the code for a minute here,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.470
what we can see is at the
bottom, I called ans quest,

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:04.350
saying each trial should be 500
steps, and run 100 trials.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:20.120
And then we'll plot
this graph.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.170
Graph is lurking somewhere
in there, it is.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.530
And one of the nice things we'll
see is, it's kind of

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.860
smooth, And we'll come back to
this, but the fact that it's

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:38.150
sort of smooth makes me feel
that running 100 trials might

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:43.800
actually be enough to give
me a consistent answer.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.930
You know, if it had been
bouncing up and down as we

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:51.860
went, then we'd say, jeez,
no trend here.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.250
Seeing a relatively smooth trend
makes me feel somewhat

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:59.750
comfortable that we're
actually getting an

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.960
appropriate answer.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.890
And that if I were to run 500
trials, the line would be

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.650
smoother, but it would look
kind of the same.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.610
Because it doesn't look like
it's moving here, in arbitrary

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.050
directions large amounts.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:19.150
It's not like the
stock market.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:23.680
Should I be happy?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.960
I've sort of done what I wanted,
I kind of I think I

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.460
have an answer now, which is 500
steps, it should be four

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:37.470
and a half units away
from the origin.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.250
What do you think?

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:48.440
Who think this is the
right answer?

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:55.070
So who thinks it's a wrong
answer, raise your hand?

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.970
All right, TAs, what
do you guys think?

00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.000
Putting you on the spot.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.760
Right answer or wrong answer?

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.410
They think it's right.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.820
Well, shame on them.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.870
Let's remember, rack our brains
to a week ago, when we

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.760
ran a bunch of individual
tests.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.750
And let's see what we
get if we do that.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:27.370
And the point here is, it's
always good to check.

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.020
My recollection, when I looked
at this, was that

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.740
something was amiss.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.650
Because I kind of remember, when
I ran the test last time,

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:41.150
we were more like 40 away
than four away.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.670
Well all right, let's try it.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:58.220
We'll, sometimes happens, all
right, I'm going to have to

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:03.360
restart Idol here, just, as you
all, at least all who use

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.060
Macintoshes know, this happens
sometimes, it's not

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:18.590
catastrophic.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:22.190
Sigh.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.030
So this reminds me
of the old joke.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:31.760
That a computer scientist, a
mechanical engineer, were

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.990
riding in a car and the car
stalled, stopped running.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.320
And the mechanical engineer said
I know what to do, let's

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.440
go out and check
the carburetor,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.480
and look at the engine.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.390
The computer scientist
said, no that's the

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.480
wrong thing to do.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.990
What you ought to do is, let's
turn off the key, get out of

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.630
the car, shut the doors, open
the doors, get back in and

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.550
restart it.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.940
And sure enough, it worked.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.870
So when in doubt, reboot.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:09.580
So, we'll come down, we'll do
that, and we're going to call

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:18.010
first test here, and see
what that gives us.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:33.980
And we'll, for the moment,
ignore that.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.320
Well, look at this.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.200
We ran a bunch of Homer's random
walks, and maybe it

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:45.700
isn't 40, but not even
one of them was four.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.540
So now we see is, we've run two
tests, and we've gotten

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.210
inconsistent answers.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.260
Well, we don't know which
one is wrong.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.590
We know that one of
them is wrong.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.090
We don't even know that, maybe
we just got unlucky with these

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.050
five tests.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:08.240
But odds are, something
is wrong, that

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.770
there's a bug here.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.400
And, we have to figure
out which one.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.670
So how would we go
about doing that?

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:28.370
Well, I'm going to do what I
always recommend people do.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:34.320
Which was, find a really simple
example, One for which

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.210
I actually know the answer.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.110
So what would be a good example
for which I might know

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:49.060
the answer?

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.810
Give me the simplest example of
a simulation of the random

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.110
walk I could run, where you're
confident you know

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.020
what the answer is.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.880
Yeah? one step, exactly,
and what's the

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.630
answer after one step?

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.780
One.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.120
She can't catch and talk
at the same time.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.730
Exactly.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.170
So we know if we simulate it,
one, the drunk has moved in

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.730
some direction, and is going
to be exactly one step from

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.140
the origin.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.070
So now we can go and
see what we get.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.920
So let's do that.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:36.410
And we'll change this
to be one, and we'll

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:45.410
change this to be one.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:56.210
We'll see what the answer is.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.530
Well.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.990
50?

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.550
Well, kind of makes me worry.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.380
1.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:15.070
All right, so we see that the
simple test of Homer gives me

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.770
the right answer.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.760
We don't know it's always the
right answer, we know it's, at

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.970
least for this 1.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.440
But we know the other
1 was just way off.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.910
Interestingly, unlike the
previous time, instead of

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.860
being way too low, it's
way too high.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.160
So that gives us some
pause for thought.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.120
And now we need to go
in and debug it.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.720
So let's go and debug it.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:51.270
And seems to me the right thing
to do is to go here.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.590
Oh, boy, I'm going to have to
restart it again, not good.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.300
And we'll put an intermediate
value.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:07.440
Actually, maybe we'll do it.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:16.510
What would be a nice
thing to do here?

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.580
We're going to come here.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.130
Well, let's, you know, we want
to go somewhere halfway

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.440
through the program, print some
intermediate value that

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.100
will give us some information.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:35.380
So, this might be
a good place.

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:43.980
And, what should we print?

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:55.260
Well, what values do you think
you should get here?

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:55.590
Pardon?

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.500
STUDENT: The total
distance so far.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.160
PROFESSOR: The total
distance so far.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.170
So that would be a good
thing to print.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:24.930
And what do we think
it should be?

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.080
We'll comment this 1 out since
we think that works, and just

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.230
to be safe, let's not even run
100 trials let's, run one

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:38.470
trial, or two trials maybe.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:45.540
See we get.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.200
0 and then 2.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.780
W, 0 was sort of what we
expected the first time

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.770
around, but 2?

00:23:54.770 --> 00:24:00.870
How did you get to be 2?

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.940
Anyone want to see what's
going on here?

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.080
So we see, right here we
have the wrong answer.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.440
Well, maybe we should
see what things

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:18.550
looked like before this?

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:19.930
Is it the lists are wrong?

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.130
What am I doing wrong here?

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:32.100
I'll bet someone can
figure this out.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.440
Pardon?

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.510
PROFESSOR: Well, I'm adding
them up, fair enough.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.960
But so tot looks OK.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.280
So, all right, maybe we should
take a look at means.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.550
Right?

00:24:49.550 --> 00:25:03.820
Let's take a look at what
that looks like.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.370
Not bad.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.570
All right, so maybe my
example's too simple.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:19.420
Let's try a little bit bigger.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.180
Hmmm --

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.780
2.5?

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.600
All right, so now I know what's
going wrong is, somehow

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.140
not that I'm messing up tot,
but that I'm computing the

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.530
mean incorrectly.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.750
Where am I computing the mean?

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.600
They're only two expressions
here.

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.540
There's tot, we've
checked that.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.380
So there must be a problem with
the divisor, that's the

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.110
only thing that's left.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.440
Yeah?

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.180
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.580
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:02.090
I should be dividing by the
length of the list. The number

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.240
of things I'm adding to tot.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:19.030
So I just, inadvertently,
divided by, I

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.380
have a list of lists.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.410
And what I really wanted
to do is, divide by

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.300
the number of lists.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.720
Because I'm computing the mean
for each list, adding it to

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.700
total, and then at the end I
need to divide by the number

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.920
of lists who's means I computed,
not by the length of

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.950
1 of the lists, right?

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:49.000
So now, let's see what
happens if we run it.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.350
Now, we get some output printed,
which I really didn't

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.760
want, but it happens.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.210
Well this looks a lot better.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.540
Right?

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:08.580
Sure enough, it's 1.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.650
All right, so now I'm
feeling better.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.910
I'm going to get rid of this
print statement, if we're

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.630
gonna run a more extensive test.
And now we can go back

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:25.390
to our original question.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:35.850
And run it.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.620
Well, this looks a lot
more consistent

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.890
with what we saw before.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:49.930
It says that on average, you
should be around 20.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.560
So we feel pretty
good about that.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.130
Now, just to feel even better,
I'm going to double the number

00:27:56.130 --> 00:28:10.510
of trials and see what
that tells us.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.700
And it's still around 20.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.060
Line a little smoother.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.030
And if I where do 1000 trials
will get a little smoother,

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.890
and it would still
be around 20.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:26.580
Maybe slightly different each
time, but consistent with what

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.760
we saw before, when we ran
the other program.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.860
We can feel that we're actually

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.310
doing something useful.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.060
And so now we can conclude,
and would actually be the

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.650
correct conclusion, that we know
about how far this random

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:47.500
drunk is going to move
in 500 steps.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.270
And if you want to know how
far he would move in 1000

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.260
steps, we could try that, too.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.310
All right.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:59.280
What are the lessons here?

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:05.750
One lesson is to look at
the labels on the axes.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.520
Because if we just looked at
it without noticing these

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.130
numbers, it looks the same.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.770
Right?

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.870
This doesn't look any different,
in some sense, than

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:18.270
when the numbers were four.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.730
So you can't just look at the
shape of the curve, you have

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:22.990
to look at the values.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.130
So what does that tell me?

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:30.080
It tells me that a responsible
person will

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.030
always label the axes.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:39.730
As I have done here, not only
giving you the numbers, but

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.350
telling you it's the distance.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.820
I hate it when I look at graphs
and I have to guess

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.350
what the x- and y- axes are.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:53.040
Here it says time versus
distance, and you also notice

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.790
I put a title on it.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.370
So there's a point there.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:08.630
And look, when you're
doing it.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:16.820
Ask if the answer make sense.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.060
One of the things we'll see as
we go on, is you can get all

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:24.920
your statistics right, and still
get the wrong answer

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:29.260
because of a consistent bug.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.370
And so always just say, do I
believe it, or is this so

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.230
counterintuitive that
I'm suspicious?

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:43.980
And as part of that ask, is it

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:51.270
consistent with other evidence?

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.280
In this case we had the evidence
of watching an

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.440
individual walk.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.290
Now those two things were not
consistent, don't know which

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.970
is wrong, but it must
be one of them.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.650
And then the final point I
wanted to make, is that you

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:20.040
can be pretty systematic about
debugging, And in particular,

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:28.090
debug with a simple example.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.790
Right, instead of trying to
debug 500 steps and 100

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.300
trials, I said, all right, let's
look at one step and

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.410
four trials, five trials.

00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.000
OK, where in my head I knew what
it should look like, and

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.250
then I could check it.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.400
All right.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:52.650
Jumping up a level or three
of abstraction now.

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.800
What we've done, is we've
introduced the notion of a

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:00.900
random walk in the context of
a pretty contrived example.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.750
But in fact, it's worth knowing
that random walks are

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:11.230
used all over the place to solve
real problems, deal with

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.100
real phenomena.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.070
So for example, if you look
at something like Brownian

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:31.650
motion, which can be used to
model the path traced by a

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.580
molecule as it travels
in a liquid or a gas.

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.260
Typically, people who do that
model it using a random walk.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.180
And, depending upon, say the
density of the gas or the

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.790
liquid, the size of the
molecules, they change

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.680
parameters in the simulation,
how far it, say, goes in each

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.810
unit time and things
like that.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.790
But they use a random walk
to try and model

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.240
what will really happened.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.740
People have attempted, for
several hundred years now, to

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.690
use, well, maybe a 150 years,
to use random walks to model

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:12.580
the stock market.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.540
There was a very famous book
called A Random Walk Down Wall

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:23.980
Street, that argued that things
happened as a, random

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:29.210
walk was a good way
to model things.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.260
There's a lot of evidence that
says that's wrong, but people

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.310
continue to attempt to do it.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.820
They use it a lot
in biology to do

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:44.930
things like model kinetics.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:50.390
So, the kinetics of a protein,
DNA strand exchange, things of

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.140
that nature.

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.490
A separation of macro-molecules,
the movement

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:02.630
of microorganisms all of those
things are done in biology.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.490
And do that.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:10.330
People use it to model
evolution.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:15.610
They look at mutations as
kind of a random event.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:20.450
So, we'll come back to this, but
random walks are used over

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:24.100
and over and over again in the
sciences, the social sciences

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:29.020
and therefore a very useful
thing to notice about.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.890
All right, we're going
to come back to that.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.600
We're going to even come back
to our drunken student and

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.220
look at other kinds of random
walks other than the kind we

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:38.950
just looked at.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.650
Before I do that, though, I
wanted back up and take the

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.240
magic out of plotting.

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.940
So we've gone from the sublime,
of what random walks

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.430
are good for, to in some sense
the ridiculous, the actual

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:56.590
syntax for plotting things.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:01.680
And maybe it's not ridiculous,
but it's boring.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.420
But you need it, so
let's look at it.

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:12.650
So we're doing this using a
package called Pylab, which is

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:27.330
in itself built on a package
called Pylab, either

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:31.750
pronounced num p or num pi,
you can choose your

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.150
pronunciation as you prefer.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:38.770
This basically gives you a lot
of operations on numbers,

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.450
numbered things, and on top of
that, someone bill Pylab which

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:47.590
is designed to provide a Python
interface to a lot of

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:50.800
the functionality you
get in Matlab.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.110
And in particular, we're going
to be using today the plotting

00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:00.140
functionality that comes with
Matlab, or the version of it.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:05.230
So we're going to say, from
Pylab import star, that's just

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:09.350
so I don't have to type Pylab
dot plot every time.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.010
And I'm going import
random which we're

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.770
going to use later.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.200
So let's look at it now.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.860
First thing we're going to do
is plot 1, 2, 3, 4, and then

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.560
1, 2, 3, and then 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.930
And then at the very bottom,
you'll see this line show.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.480
That's going to annoy the heck
out of you throughout the

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.050
semester, the rest
of the semester.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.860
Because what happens is, Pylab
produces all these beautiful

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.330
plots, and then does
not display them

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.240
until you type show.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.350
So remember, at the end of every
program, kind of, the

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.640
last thing you should execute
should be show.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.160
You don't want to execute it
in the middle, because what

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.710
happens in the middle is it,
in an interactive mode at

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.530
least, it just stops.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.650
And displays the graphs, and
until you make the plots go

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.260
away, it won't execute
the next line.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.900
Which is why I've tucked the
show at the very bottom of my

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.170
script here.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.600
Inevitably, you will forget
to type show.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.600
You will ask a TA, how come my
graphs aren't appearing in the

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:21.330
screen, and the TA will
say, did you do show?

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:25.780
And you'll go -- but it
happens to all of us.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.450
All right, so let's try it.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:34.870
See what we get.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:41.080
So sure enough, it's plotted the
values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:44.810
6, 7, 8, on the x-
and y- axis.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.610
Two things I want you
to notice here.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:56.150
One Is, that both plots showed
up on the same figure.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.290
Which is sometimes what you
want, and sometimes

00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:59.960
not what you want.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.400
You'll notice that also happened
with the random walk

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.360
we looked at, where when I
plotted five different walks

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.180
for Homer they all showed
up superimposed

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.500
on top of one another.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.700
The other thing I want you to
notice, is the x-axis runs

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.840
from 0 to 3.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.550
So you might have kind of
thought, that what we would

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.240
see is a 45 degree angle
on these things.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.320
But of course, Python, when
not instructed otherwise,

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.890
always starts at zero.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:43.680
Since when we called plot, I
gave it only the y-values, it

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.870
used default values for x.

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:53.090
It was smart enough to say,
since we have four y-values,

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:57.270
we should need four x-values,
and I'll choose the integers

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:04.650
0, 1, 2, 3 as those values.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.560
Now you don't have to do that.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:18.300
We could do this instead.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:20.600
Let's try this one.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.010
What did I just do?

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:31.760
Let's comment these two out,
if we could only get there.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:42.270
This is highly annoying.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.820
Let's hope it doesn't tell
me that I have to --

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:50.180
All right, so let's go here.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:58.200
We'll get rid of those guys,
and we'll try this one.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:17.660
We'll plot 1, 2, 3, 4
against 1, 4, 9, 16.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.420
OK?

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:26.060
So now, it's using 1, 2, 3,
4 as the x-axis, and the

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.550
y-axis I gave it.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.920
First x then y.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.080
Now it looks a little funny,
right, you might have not

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.840
expected it to look like this.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.560
You'll notice they're these
little inflection points here.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.580
Well, because what it's really
doing is, I gave it a small

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.440
number of points, only four.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:51.240
It's found those four points,
and it's connected them, each

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.700
point by a straight line.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.360
And since the points are kind
of spread out, the line has

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:03.210
little bumps in it.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.280
That makes sense to everyone?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.210
Now, it's often deceptive to
plot things this way, where

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.900
you think you have a continuous
function when in

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:17.640
fact you just have a few
miscellaneous points.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.630
So let's look at another
example.

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:27.590
Here, what I'm going to do,
is I've called figure, and

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:34.990
remember, this is Pylab dot
figure, which says, create a

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.990
new figure.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:40.680
So instead of putting this new
curve on the same figure as

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:44.530
the old curve, start
a new one.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:48.610
And furthermore, I've got this
obscure little thing

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:50.560
at the end of it.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.690
After you give it the x- and
y- values, you can give it

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:59.340
some instructions about how you
want to plot points, or

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.890
anything else.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:05.780
In this case, what this little
string says is, each point

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:12.820
should be represented as a red
o. r for red, o for o.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.340
I'm not asking you to remember
this, what you will discover,

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:21.520
the good news is there's very
good documentation on this.

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.550
And so you'll find in the
reading of pointer to plots,

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:29.800
and it will tell you everything
you need to know,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.380
all of the wizardry and the
magic you can put in these

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.130
strings that tell you
how to do things.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:41.460
These are basically the same
strings borrowed from Matlab.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:48.370
And now if we run it.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:53.620
Figure one is the same
figure we saw before.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:58.660
But figure two has not connected
the dots, not drawn

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:05.220
a line, it's actually planted
each, or plotted, excuse me,

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:11.450
each point as a red circle.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:15.950
Now when I look at this, there's
something that's not

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:18.300
very pleasing about this.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.680
That in particular, I know I
plotted four points, but it a

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.510
quick glance it looks like
they're only three.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.040
And that's because it's taking
this fourth point and stuck it

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.580
way up there in the corner
where I missed it.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.040
It's there.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:44.590
But it's so close to the edge of
the graph that it's kind of

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.580
hard to see.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:44:09.520
So I can fix that by executing
the command axis, which tells

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.820
it how far I want it to be.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.240
And this says, I want 1 axis
to go from 0 to 6, and the

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.090
other 0 to 20.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:26.450
We'll do that, and also to avoid
boring you, we'll do

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:29.680
more at the same time.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:36.400
We'll put some labels
on these things.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.810
I'm going to put that the title
of the graph is going to

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:44.960
be earnings, and that the x-axis
will be labelled days,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.500
and the y-axis will be
labelled dollars.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:55.210
So earnings dollars
against days.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:45:03.970
OK, now let's see what happens
when we do this.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:07.680
Well, we get the same ugly
figure one as before, and now

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.190
you can see figure two I've
moved the axes so that my

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.950
graph will show up in the middle
rather than at the

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.230
edges, and therefore
easier to read.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:22.520
I put a title in the top, and
I put labels on the axes.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:26.850
Every graph that I ask you to do
this course, I want you to

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:29.935
put a title on it and to label
your axes so we know what

00:45:29.935 --> 00:45:32.560
we're reading.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.830
Again, nothing very deep here,
this is really just syntax,

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.900
just to give you an idea
of the sorts of

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:45.250
things you can do.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:47.480
All right. now we get to
something a little bit more

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:52.220
interesting.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:46:02.120
Let's look at this code here.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:07.470
So far, what I've been passing
to the plot function for the

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:13.410
x- and y- values are lists.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:22.530
In fact, what Pylab uses is
something it gets from NumPy

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:33.500
which are not lists really,
but what it calls arrays.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:39.810
Now, truth be told, most
programming languages use

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:42.860
array to mean something
quite different.

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:53.380
But, in NumPy an array is
basically a matrix.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.600
On which we can do some
interesting things.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:02.210
So for example, when
I say x-axes equals

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.040
array 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.380
Array is a type, so array
applied to the list is just

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.790
like applying float to an int.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:14.090
If I apply float to an int,
it turns it into a

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.960
floating point number.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.780
If I apply array to a list,
it turns it into an array.

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.380
Once it's an array, as we'll
see, we can do some very

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:28.720
interesting things with it.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:34.100
Now, in addition to getting an
array by coercing a the list,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.900
which is probably the
most common way to

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.600
get it, by the way.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.590
Because you build up a list in
simulations of the sort we

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.480
looked at, and then you might
want to change it to an array

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.010
to perform some operations
on it.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:50.080
You can get an array directly
with aRange.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.540
This is just like the range
function we've been using all

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.900
term, but whereas the range
function gives you a list of

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:04.390
ints, this gives you
an array of ints.

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:08.120
But the nice thing about an
array is, I can perform

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:13.550
operations on it like this.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:17.840
So if I say y-axis equals x-axis
raised to the third

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.370
power, that's something I can't
do with a list. I get an

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:25.990
error message if I try that with
a list. What that will do

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.990
is, will point-wise, take
each element in the

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.290
array and cube it.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:38.300
So the nice thing about arrays
is, you can use them to do the

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.350
kinds of things you, if you
ever took a linear algebra

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:43.810
course, you learned
about doing.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.510
You can multiply an array
times an array, You can

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.050
multiply an array times
an integer.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:53.020
And sometimes that's a very
convenient thing to do.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.270
It's not what this course is
about, I don't want to

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.680
emphasize it.

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.960
I just want you to know it's
there so if in some subsequent

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:06.430
life you want to do more
complicated manipulations,

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.410
you'll know that that's
possible.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:27.200
So let's run this and
see what we get.

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:32.150
So the first thing to look at,
is we'll ignore the figure for

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.830
the moment.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:42.440
And we've seen that when I
printed test and I printed

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:48.390
x-axis, they look the same,
they are the same.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.520
And in fact, I can do this
interesting thing now.

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.740
Print test double
equals x-axis.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.410
You might have thought
that would return a

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:00.050
single value, true.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:04.440
Instead it returns a list, where
it's done a point-wise

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.490
comparison of each element.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:13.070
So when we deal with arrays,
they don't behave like lists.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:15.720
And you can imagine that it
might be very convenient to be

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.460
able to do this.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.250
Answers the question, are all
the elements the same?

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.180
Or which ones are the same?

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:27.110
So you can imagine doing some
very clever things with these.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:32.250
And certainly, if you can
convert problems to vectors of

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.980
this sort, you can really
perform what's almost magical.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:44.450
And then when we look at the
figure, which should be tucked

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:51.120
away somewhere here, what did
I do with the figure?

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:57.250
Did I make it go away?

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:05.020
Well, I think I did one of those
ugly things and made it

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.290
go away again.

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:08.010
Oh, no, there it is.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.410
All right.

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:14.620
And sure enough here, we're
plotting a cubic.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.020
All right.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:21.340
Nothing very important to
observe about any of that,

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.790
other than that arrays are
really quite interesting and

00:51:23.790 --> 00:51:26.660
can be very valuable.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:31.070
Finally, the thing I want to
show you is that there are a

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:39.390
lot of things we can do that are
more interesting than what

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:46.940
we've done.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.270
So now I'm going to use that
random, which I brought in

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:58.180
before, and show you that we
can plot things other than

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.690
simply curves.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.600
In this case, I'm going
to plot a histogram.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:07.940
And what this histogram is going
to do is, I'm going to

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:12.510
throw a pair of dice a large
number of times, and add up

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:16.250
the sum, and see what I get.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:20.260
So, for die values equals 1
through 6, for i in range

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:22.310
10,000, a lot of dice.

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:24.940
I'm just going to append random
choice, we've seen this

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.910
before, of the two dice,
and their sum.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.900
And then I'm going to plot a
histogram, Pylab dot hist

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:42.220
instead of plot, and we'll get
something quite different.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:46.730
A nice little histogram showing
me the values I get,

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:50.250
and we will come back to this
later and talk about why this

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:52.490
is called a normal
distribution.
