00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.030
PROFESSOR JOHN GUTTAG:
Good morning.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.860
We should start with the
confession, for those of you

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.990
looking at this on
OpenCourseWare, that I'm

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.760
currently lecturing to
an empty auditorium.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.750
The fifth lecture for 600 this
term, we ran into some

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.810
technical difficulties, which
left us with a recording we

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.950
weren't very satisfied with.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.220
So, I'm-- this is a redo, and if
you will hear no questions

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.450
from the audience and that's
because there is no audience.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.860
Nevertheless I will do
my best to pretend.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.840
I've been told this is a little
bit like giving a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.570
speech before the US Congress
when C-SPAN is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.280
the only thing watching.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.840
OK.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.400
Computers are supposed to be
good for crunching numbers.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
And we've looked a little bit
at numbers this term, but I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.660
now want to get into looking
at them in more depth than

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.050
we've been doing.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:32.090
Python has two different
kinds of numbers.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.300
So far, the only kind we've
really paid any attention to

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.450
is type int.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.430
And those were intended to
mirror the integers, as we all

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.930
learned about starting
in elementary school.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.500
And they're good for things
that you can count.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.620
Any place you'd use
whole numbers.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
Interestingly, Python, unlike
some languages, has what are

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.520
called arbitrary precision
integers.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.730
By that, we mean, you can
make numbers as big as

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.380
you want them to.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.620
Let's look at an example.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.260
We'll just take a for a variable
name, and we'll set a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.050
to be two raised to the
one-thousandth power.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.400
That, by the way, is a
really big number.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.820
And now what happens if
we try and display it?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.340
We get a lot of digits.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.770
You can see why I'm doing this
on the screen instead of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.700
writing it on the blackboard.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.640
I'm not going to ask you whether
you believe this is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.900
the right answer, trust
me, trust Python.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.080
I would like you to notice, at
the very end of this is the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.840
letter L.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.280
What does that mean?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.480
It means long.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.030
That's telling us that it's
representing these-- this

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.900
particular integer in
what it calls it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.290
internal long format.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.440
You needn't worry about that.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.760
The only thing to say about it
is, when you're dealing with

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.190
long integers, it's a lot less
efficient than when you're

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.870
dealing with smaller numbers.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.370
And that's all it's kind of
warning you, by printing this

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.640
L.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.260
About two billion is
the magic number.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.120
When you get over two billion,
it's now going to deal with

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.480
long integers, so if, for
example, you're trying to deal

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.030
with the US budget deficit, you
will need integers of type

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.390
L.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.200
OK.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.680
Let's look at another
interesting example.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.340
Suppose I said, b equal to two
raised to the nine hundred

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.010
ninety-ninth power.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.600
I can display b, and it's a
different number, considerably

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.420
smaller, but again,
ending in an L.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.590
And now, what you think I'll get
if we try a divided by b?

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.470
And remember, we're now doing
integer division.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.800
Well, let's see.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.070
We get 2L.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.080
Well, you'd expect it to be
two, because if you think

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.580
about the meaning of
exponentiation, indeed, the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.940
difference between raising
something to the nine hundred

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.930
ninety-ninth power and to the
one-thousandth power should

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.990
be, in this case, two, since
that's what we're

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.230
raising to a power.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.370
Why does it say 2L, right?

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.070
Two is considerably less than
two billion, and that's

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.870
because once you get L, you
stay L. Not particularly

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.900
important, but kind
of worth knowing.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.480
Well, why am I bothering you
with this whole issue of how

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.370
numbers are represented
in the computer?

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.940
In an ideal world, you would
ignore this completely, and

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.090
just say, numbers do what
numbers are supposed to do.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.880
But as we're about to see,
sometimes in Python, and in

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880
fact in every programming
language, things behave

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.420
contrary to what your
intuition suggests.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.770
And I want to spend a little
time helping you understand

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.530
why this happens.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.590
So let's look at a different
kind of number.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.620
And now we're going to look at
what Python, and almost every

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.560
other programming language,
calls type float.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:03.170
Which is short for
floating point.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.160
And that's the way that
programming languages

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.390
typically represent what we
think of as real numbers.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.050
So, let's look at an example.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:24.160
I'm going to set the variable
x to be 0.1, 1/10, and now

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.510
we're going to display x.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.750
Huh?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.640
Take a look at this.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.740
Why isn't it .1?

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.770
Why is it 0.1, a whole bunch
of zeros, and then this

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.100
mysterious one appearing
at the end?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.900
Is it because Python just wants
to be obnoxious and is

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.960
making life hard?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.660
No, it has to do with the way
the numbers are represented

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.280
inside the computer.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.800
Python, like almost every modern
programming language,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.560
represents numbers using the
i triple e floating point

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:20.820
standard, and it's
i triple e 754.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.760
Never again will you have to
remember that it's 754.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.480
I promise not to ask you that
question on a quiz.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.320
But that's what they do.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:41.860
This is a variant of scientific
notation.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.000
Something you probably learned
about in high school, as a way

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.220
to represent very
large numbers.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.320
Typically, the way we do that,
is we represent the numbers in

00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:07.730
the form of a mantissa
and an exponent.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.460
So we represent a floating point
number as a pair, of a

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:20.260
mantissa and an exponent.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.110
And because computers work in
the binary system, it's unlike

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.410
what you probably learned in
high school, where we raise

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.530
ten to some power.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.710
Here we'll always be raising
two to some power.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.900
Maybe a little later in the
term, if we talk about

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.500
computer architecture, we'll get
around to explaining why

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.720
computers working binary, but
for now, just assume that they

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.970
do and in fact they

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.810
always have. All right.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:09:01.460
Purists manage to refer to the
mantissa as a significant, but

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.400
I won't do that, because I'm
an old guy and it was a

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.140
mantissa when I first learned
about it and I just can't

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.460
break myself of the habit.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:11.870
All right.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:18.520
So how does this work?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.450
Well, when we recognize so--
when we represent something,

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:35.360
the mantissa is between
one and two.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.270
Whoops.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.090
Strictly less than two, greater
than or equal to one.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:10:07.420
The exponent, is in the
range, -1022 to +1023.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.330
So this lets us represent
numbers up to about 10 to the

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.800
308th, plus or minus 10 to
the 308th, plus or minus.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.050
So, quite a large range
of numbers.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.240
Where did these magic
things come from?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.710
You know, what-- kind of a
strange numbers to see here.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:37.040
Well, it has to do with the fact
that computers typically

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.830
have words in them, and the
words today in a modern

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:46.370
computer are 64 bits.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.780
For many years they were 32
bits, before that they were 16

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.520
bits, before that they were 8
bits, they've continually

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.350
grown, but we've been at 64 for
a while and I think we'll

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:02.300
be stuck at 64 for a while.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.880
So as we do this, what we do
is, we get one bit for the

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.220
sign-- is it a positive
or negative number?--

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:28.220
11 for the exponent, and that
leaves 52 for the mantissa.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.340
And that basically tells us
how we're storing numbers.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.890
Hi, are you here for
the 600 lecture?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.840
There is none today, because we
have a quiz this evening.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.170
It's now the time that the
lecture would normally have

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.450
started, and a couple of
students who forgot that we

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.270
have a quiz this evening,
instead of a lecture, just

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.780
strolled in, and now
strolled out.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.620
OK.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.260
You may never need to know these
constants again, but

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.290
it's worth knowing that they
exist, and that basically,

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:08.360
this gives us about the
equivalent of seventeen

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.190
decimal digits of precision.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.810
So we can represent numbers
up to seventeen

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.520
decimal digits long.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.410
This is an important concept to
understand, that unlike the

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:30.220
long ints where they can grow
arbitrarily big, when we're

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.930
dealing with floating points, if
we need something more than

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.980
seventeen decimal digits, in
Python at least, we won't be

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.570
able to get it.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.740
And that's true in
many languages.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.350
Now the good news is, this is
an enormous number, and it's

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.100
highly unlikely that ever in
your life, you will need more

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.850
precision than that.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.550
All right.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:13:00.610
Now, let's go back to the 0.1
mystery that we started at,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.990
and ask ourselves, why we have
a problem representing that

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:10.860
number in the computer, hence,
we get something funny out

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.700
from we try and print it back.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.090
Well, let's look at an easier
problem first. Let's look at

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:26.420
representing the fraction 1/8.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.210
That has a nice representation.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:37.060
That's equal in decimal to
0.125, and we can represent it

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:42.980
conveniently in both
base 10 and base 2.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:53.200
So if you want to represent
it in base 10, what is it?

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.190
What is that equal to?

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:02.010
Well, we'll take a mantissa,
1.25, and now we need to

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:09.850
multiply it by something that
we can represent nicely, and

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:14.330
in fact that will be
times 10 to the -1.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.880
So the exponent would simply
be -1, and we have a nice

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.760
representation.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.760
Suppose we want to represent
it in base 2?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.260
What would it be?

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:37.210
1.0 times-- anybody?--

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:44.040
Well, 2 to the -3.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:53.380
So, in binary notation, that
would be written as 0.001.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.190
So you see, 1/8 is kind
of a nice number.

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:01.850
We can represent it nicely in
either base 10 or base 2.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:14.970
But how about that pesky
fraction 1/10?

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:20.010
Well, in base 10, we know
how to represent, it's

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:27.390
1 times 10 to the--

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:28.420
10 to the what?--

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.110
10 to the 1?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.930
No.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:41.110
But in base 2, it's a problem.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:47.320
There is no finite binary number
that exactly represents

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.390
this decimal fraction.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.360
In fact, if we try and find
the binary number, what we

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.710
find is, we get an infinitely
repeating series.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:06.570
Zero zero zero one one zero
zero one one zero

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.970
zero, and et cetera.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:14.500
Stop at any finite number of
bits, and you get only an

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:20.770
approximation to the decimal
fraction 1/10.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:27.250
So on most computers, if you
were to print the decimal

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.160
value of the binary
approximation-- and that's

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.660
what we're printing here,
on this screen, right?

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:37.960
We think in decimal, so Python
quite nicely for us is

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:43.160
printing things in decimal--
it would have to display--

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.190
well I'm not going to write it,
it's a very long number,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:55.190
lots of digits-- however, in
Python, whenever we display

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:01.130
something, it uses the built-in
function repr, short

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.950
for representation, that it
converts the internal

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:10.690
representation in this case of
a number, to a string, and

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:15.510
then displays that string in
this case on the screen.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:24.040
For floats, it rounds it
to seventeen digits.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:31.060
There's that magic number
seventeen again.

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:36.470
Hence, when it rounds it to
seventeen digits, we get

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:44.160
exactly what you see in the
bottom of the screen up there.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.240
Answer to the mystery, why
does it display this?

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.470
Now why should we care?

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.900
Well, it's not so much that
we care about what gets

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.010
displayed, but we have to think
about the implications,

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.250
at least sometimes we have to
think about the implications,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.510
of what this inexact
representation of numbers

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:09.970
means when we start doing
more-or-less complex

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.250
computations on those numbers.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.140
So let's look at a little
example here.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.300
I'll start by starting the
variable s to 0.0 .

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.320
Notice I'm being careful
to make it a float.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:33.960
And then for i in range, let's
see, let's take 10, we'll

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:44.710
increase s by 0.1 .

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.850
All right, we've done that,
and now, what happens

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.330
when I print s?

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.140
Well, again you don't get
what your intuition

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.230
says you should get.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:05.470
Notice the last two digits,
which are eight and nine.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:09.760
Well, what's happening here?

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.670
What's happened, is the
error has accumulated.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.180
I had a small error when I
started, but every time I

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:22.550
added it, the error got bigger
and it accumulates.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:27.170
Sometimes you can get in trouble
in a computation

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.410
because of that.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.940
Now what happens, by the
way, if I print s?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.130
That's kind of an interesting
question.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.810
Notice that it prints one.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.550
And why is that?

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:46.130
It's because the print command
has done a rounding here.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.360
It automatically rounds.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.810
And that's kind of good, but
it's also kind of bad, because

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.980
that means when you're debugging
your program, you

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.010
can get very confused.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.470
You say, it says it's one, why
am I getting a different

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.880
answer when I do the
computation?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.100
And that's because it's
not really one inside.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.740
So you have to be careful.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.040
Now mostly, these round-off
errors balance each other out.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.690
Some floats are slightly higher
than they're supposed

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.480
to be, some are slightly
lower, and in most

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.250
computations it all comes out
in the wash and you get the

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.810
right answer.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.390
Truth be told, most of the time,
you can avoid worrying

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.110
about these things.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:37.400
But, as we say in Latin,
caveat computor.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.490
Sometimes you have to
worry a little bit.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.860
Now there is one thing about
floating points about which

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.720
you should always worry.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.140
And that's really the point I
want to drive home, and that's

00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:08.260
about the meaning
of double equal.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.950
Let's look at an example
of this.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.700
So we've before seen the use
of import, so I'm going to

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.670
import math, it gives me some
useful mathematical functions,

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.440
then I'm going to set the
variable a to the

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.190
square root of two.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.590
Whoops.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.090
Why didn't this work?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.590
Because what I should have
said is math dot

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:42.100
square root of two.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.380
Explaining to the interpreter
that I want to get the

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:52.600
function sqrt from
the module math.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:59.520
So now I've got a here, and I
can look at what a is, yeah,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.970
some approximation to the square
root about of two.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.560
Now here's the interesting
question.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.880
Suppose I ask about the Boolean
a times a equals

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.010
equals two.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.440
Now in my heart, I think, if
I've taken the square root of

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.780
number and then I've multiplied
it by itself, I

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.060
could get the original
number back.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:25.430
After all, that's the meaning
of square root.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.460
But by now, you won't be
surprised if the answer of

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.020
this is false, because we know
what we've stored is only an

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.650
approximation to the
square root.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.040
And that's kind of
interesting.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.460
So we can see that, by, if I
look at a times a, I'll get

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.265
two point a whole bunch
of zeros and then

00:22:46.265 --> 00:22:48.730
a four at the end.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.150
So this means, if I've got a
test in my program, in some

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:58.870
sense it will give me the
unexpected answer false.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:04.440
What this tells us, is that it's
very risky to ever use

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.870
the built-in double--equals to
compare floating points, and

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.100
in fact, you should never be
testing for equality, you

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.790
should always be testing
for close enough.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.840
So typically, what you want to
do in your program, is ask the

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:30.530
following question: is the
absolute value of a times a

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:40.610
minus 2.0 less than epsilon?

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.280
If we could easily type Greek,
we'd have written it that way,

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.380
but we can't.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.840
So that's some small value
chosen to be appropriate for

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.520
the application.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.680
Saying, if these two things
are within epsilon of each

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:00.870
other, then I'm going to
treat them as equal.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:04.020
And so what I typically do when
I'm writing a Python code

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.990
that's going to deal with
floating point numbers, and I

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:12.040
do this from time to time, is I
introduce a function called

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:18.940
almost equal, or near, or pick
your favorite word, that does

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.070
this for me.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.310
And wherever I would normally
written double x equals y,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:31.960
instead I write, near x,y, and
it computes it for me.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.340
Not a big deal, but keep this
in mind, or as soon as you

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.390
start dealing with numbers, you
will get very frustrated

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:43.350
in trying to understand what
your program does.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.940
OK.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.600
Enough of numbers for a while,
I'm sure some of you will find

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.100
this a relief.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.380
I now want to get away from
details of floating point, and

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.690
talk about general methods
again, returning to the real

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.770
theme of the course of solving
problems using computers.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:11.070
Last week, we looked at the
rather silly problem of

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:15.760
finding the square root
of a perfect square.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.640
Well, that's not usually
what you need.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.170
Let's think about the more
useful problem of finding the

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.640
square root of a real number.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.580
Well, you've just seen
how you do that.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.680
You import math and
you call sqrt.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.640
Let's pretend that we didn't
know that trick, or let's

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.750
pretend it's your job to
introduce-- implement,

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.200
rather-- math.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:46.250
And so, you need to figure out
how to implement square root.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.190
Why might this be a challenge?

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.230
What are some of the issues?

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.900
And there are several.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:26:09.960
One is, what we've just seen
might not be an exact answer.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:16.460
For example, the square
root of two.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.400
So we need to worry about that,
and clearly the way

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.980
we're going to solve that, as
we'll see, is using a concept

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.940
similar to epsilon.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:33.100
In fact, we'll even
call it epsilon.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.620
Another problem with the method
we looked at last time

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.100
is, there we were doing
exhaustive enumeration.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.040
We were enumerating all the
possible answers, checking

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.680
each one, and if it was
good, stopping.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:55.380
Well, the problem with reals, as
opposed to integers, is we

00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:06.310
can't enumerate all guesses.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:14.540
And that's because the reals
are uncountable.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.280
If I ask you to enumerate the
positive integers, you'll say

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.350
one, two, three, four, five.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:28.880
If I ask you to enumerate the
reals, the positive reals,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.950
where do you start?

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.960
One over a billion,
plus who knows?

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.610
Now as we've just seen in fact,
since there's a limit to

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:42.000
the precision floating point,
technically you can enumerate

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.970
all the floating
point numbers.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.510
And I say technically, because
if you tried to do that, your

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.630
computation would not terminate
any time soon.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.050
So even though in some, in
principle you could enumerate

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.780
them, in fact you
really can't.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.280
And so we think of the floating
points, like the

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.900
reals, as being innumerable.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:10.020
Or not innumerable, as to say
as being uncountable.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.160
So we can't do that.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:19.450
So we have to find something
clever, because we're now

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.220
searching a very large space
of possible answers.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.502
What would, technically
you might call

00:28:26.502 --> 00:28:29.400
a large state space.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.240
So we're going to take our
previous method of guess and

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:41.850
check, and replace it by
something called guess, check,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.430
and improve.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:50.290
Previously, we just generated
guesses in some systematic

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.010
way, but without knowing
that we were getting

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.130
closer to the answer.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:58.270
Think of the original barnyard
problem with the chickens and

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.900
the heads and the legs, we just
enumerated possibilities,

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.440
but we didn't know that one
guess was better than the

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.690
previous guess.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.600
Now, we're going to find a way
to do the enumeration where we

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.190
have good reason to believe,
at least with high

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.940
probability, that each
guess is better than

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.330
the previous guess.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:41.610
This is what's called successive
approximation.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.810
And that's a very important
concept.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:50.140
Many problems are solved
computationally using

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:56.150
successive approximation.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:30:00.620
Every successive approximation
method has

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.640
the same rough structure.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:09.490
You start with some guess, which
would be the initial

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:20.030
guess, you then iterate-- and in
a minute I'll tell you why

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:29.630
I'm doing it this particular
way, over some range.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.730
I've chosen one hundred, but
doesn't have to be one

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:44.550
hundred, just some number
there-- if f of x, that is to

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.470
say some some function of my--

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.400
Whoops, I shouldn't
have said x.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:58.340
My notes say x, but it's the
wrong thing-- if f of x, f of

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:05.950
the guess, is close enough, so
for example, if when I square

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.370
guess, I get close enough to
the number who's root I'm--

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:20.750
square root I'm looking for,
then I'll return the guess.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:39.860
If it's not close enough,
I'll get a better guess.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:45.080
If I do my, in this case, one
hundred iterations, and I've

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.635
not get-- gotten a guess that's
good enough, I'm going

00:31:48.635 --> 00:31:54.370
to quit with some error.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.930
Saying, wow.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.150
I thought my method was good
enough that a hundred guesses

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.740
should've gotten me there.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.420
If it didn't, I may be wrong.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.070
I always like to have some
limit, so that my program

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:12.050
can't spin off into the ether,
guessing forever.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:12.560
OK.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:35.410
Let's look at an example
of that.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.730
So here's a successive
approximation

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.760
to the square root.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.930
I've called it square root bi.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.420
The bi is not a reference to the
sexual preferences of the

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.020
function, but a reference to
the fact that this is an

00:32:53.020 --> 00:33:12.950
example of what's called
a bi-section method.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:18.000
The basic idea behind any
bi-section method is the same,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.790
and we'll see lots of examples
of this semester, is that you

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:31.540
have some linearly-arranged
space of possible answers.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.960
And it has the property that if
I take a guess somewhere,

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.930
let's say there, I guess that's
the answer to the

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:45.590
question, if it turns out that's
not the answer, I can

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:50.750
easily determine whether the
answer lies to the left or the

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.600
right of the guess.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:59.680
So if I guess that 89.12 is the
square root of a number,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.170
and it turns out not to be the
square root of the number, I

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:08.790
have a way of saying, is 89.12
too big or too small.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.440
If it was too big, then I
know I'd better guess

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.680
some number over here.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.320
It was too small, then
I'd better guess

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.450
some number over here.

00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:23.810
Why do I call it bi-section?

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.510
Because I'm dividing it in half,
and in general as we'll

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:33.330
see, when I know what my space
of answers is, I always, as my

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:37.830
next guess, choose something
half-way along that line.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.750
So I made a guess, and let's say
was too small, and I know

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.020
the answer is between here and
here, this was too small, I

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.950
now know that the answer is
between here and here, so my

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:53.200
next guess will be
in the middle.

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.870
The beauty of always guessing
in the middle is, at each

00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.060
guess, if it's wrong, I
get to throw out half

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.420
of the state space.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.950
So I know how long it's going
to take me to search the

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:10.780
possibilities in some sense,
because I'm getting

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:16.410
logarithmically progressed.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:21.200
This is exactly what we saw when
we looked at recursion in

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.790
some sense, where we solved the
problem by, at each step,

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.540
solving a smaller problem.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:33.140
The same problem, but on a
smaller solution space.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.910
Now as it happens, I'm not
using recursion in this

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.980
implementation we have up on
the screen, I'm doing it

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.070
iteratively but the
idea is the same.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.660
So we'll take a quick look at
it now, then we'll quit and

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.730
we'll come back to in the next
lecture a little more

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.630
thoroughly.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.810
I'm going to warn you right
now, that there's a bug in

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.500
this code, and in the next
lecture, we'll see if we can

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.480
discover what that is.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.900
So, it takes two arguments; x,
the number whose square root

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.620
we're looking for,
and epsilon, how

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.910
close we need to get.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:15.750
It assumes that x is
non-negative, and that epsilon

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.440
is greater than zero.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.210
Why do we need to assume
that's epsilon is

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:21.950
greater than zero?

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.380
Well, if you made epsilon zero,
and then say, we're

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.680
looking for the square root
of two, we know we'll

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.850
never get an answer.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:35.470
So, we want it to be positive,
and then it returns y such

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:39.410
that y times y is within
epsilon of x.

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:44.400
It's near, to use the
terminology we used before.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.830
The next thing we see in the
program, is two assert

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.860
statements.

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.520
This is because I never trust
the people who call my

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:57.360
functions to do the
right thing.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.670
Even though I said I'm going to
assume certain things about

00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:04.240
x and epsilon, I'm actually
going to test it.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.630
And so, I'm going to assert
that x is greater than or

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.710
equal to zero, and that epsilon
is greater than zero.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:16.603
What assert does, is it tests
the predicate, say x greater

00:37:16.603 --> 00:37:21.450
than or equal to zero, if it's
true, it does nothing, just

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.160
goes on to the next statement.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:28.390
But if it's false, it prints a
message, the string, which is

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:33.180
my second argument here, and
then the program just stops.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.610
So rather than my function going
off and doing something

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:39.490
bizarre, for example running
forever, it just stops with a

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:42.460
message saying, you called me
with arguments you shouldn't

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.900
have called me with.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.570
All right, so that's the
specification and then my

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.950
check of the assumptions.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:59.800
The next thing it does, is it
looks for a range such that I

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:04.070
believe I am assured that my
answer lies between the ran--

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:08.260
these values, and I'm going to
say, well, my answer will be

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.970
no smaller than zero, and
no bigger than x.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.040
Now, is this the tightest
possible range?

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.280
Maybe not, but I'm not
too fussy about that.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:25.010
I'm just trying to make sure
that I cover the space.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:28.470
Then I'll start with a guess,
and again I'm not going to

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.630
worry too much about the guess,
I'm going to take low

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:36.220
plus high and divide by two,
that is to say, choose

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.240
something in the middle of
this space, and then

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.180
essentially do what
we've got here.

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.620
So it's a little bit more
involved here, I'm going to

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:52.130
set my counter to one, just to
keep checking, then say, while

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.950
the absolute value of the
guess squared minus x is

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.340
greater than epsilon, that is
to say, why my guess is not

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.390
yet good enough, and the counter
is not greater than a

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:09.220
hundred, I'll get
the next guess.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.480
Notice by the way, I have a
print statement here which

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.120
I've commented out, but I sort
of figured that my program

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.500
would not work correctly the
first time, and so, I, when I

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:24.000
first typed and put in a print
statement, it would let me see

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.100
what was happening each
iteration through this loop,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.980
so that if it didn't work, I
could get a sense of why not.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.760
In the next lecture, when we
look for the bug in this

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.880
program, you will see me
uncomment out that print

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.720
statement, but for now, we
go to the next thing.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.200
And we're here, we know the
guess wasn't good enough, so I

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.690
now say, if the guess squared
was less than x, then I will

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:58.330
change the low bound
to be the guess.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:03.100
Otherwise, I'll change the high
bound to be the guess.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.960
So I move either the low bound
or I move the high bound,

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.960
either way I'm cutting
the search space

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.530
in half each step.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.110
I'll get my new guess.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.970
I'll increment my counter,
and off I go.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.440
In the happy event that
eventually I get a good enough

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.230
guess, you'll see a--

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.160
I'll exit the loop.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.030
When I exit the loop, I checked,
did I exit it because

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:32.530
I exceeded the counter,
I didn't have

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.150
a good-enough guess.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:39.140
If so, I'll print the message
iteration count exceeded.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:46.300
Otherwise, I'll print the
result and return it.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.740
Now again, if I were writing a
square root function to be

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.570
used in another program, I
probably wouldn't bother

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.140
printing the result and the
number of iterations and all

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.950
of that, but again, I'm doing
that here for, because we want

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:58.780
to see what it's doing.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.240
All right.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.580
We'll run it a couple times
and then I'll let

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:06.420
you out for the day.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:20.600
Let's go do this.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.850
All right.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.200
We're here.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.280
Well, notice when I run
it, nothing happens.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.960
Why did nothing happen?

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.690
Well, nothing happens, it
was just a function.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.030
Functions don't do anything
until I call them.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.360
So let's call it.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:49.860
Let's call square root bi with
40.001 Took only one at--

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.970
iteration, that was pretty
fast, estimated two as an

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.720
answer, we're pretty happy
with that answer.

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.990
Let's try another example.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.320
Let's look at nine.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.530
I always like to, by the way,
start with questions whose

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.690
answer I know.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.160
We'll try and get a little
bit more precise.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:12.360
Well, all right.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.620
Here it took eighteen
iterations.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.910
Didn't actually give me the
answer three, which we know

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.100
happens to be the answer, but it
gave me something that was

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.900
within epsilon of three, so it
meets the specification, so I

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.430
should be perfectly happy.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:38.690
Let's look at another example.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:46.960
Try a bigger number here.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.310
All right?

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:50.310
So I've looked for the square
root of a thousand, here it

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.000
took twenty-nine iterations,
we're kind of creeping up

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.960
there, gave me an estimate.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.280
Ah, let's look at our infamous
example of two, see

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:12.200
what it does here.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.030
Worked around.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:20.790
Now, we can see it's actually
working, and I'm getting

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:25.670
answers that we believe are
good-enough answers, but we

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.250
also see that the speed of
what we talk about as

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.270
convergence-- how many
iterations it takes, the

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.480
number of iterations-- is
variable, and it seems to be

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.620
related to at least two things,
and we'll see more

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.520
about this in the
next lecture.

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.320
The size of the number whose
square root we're looking for,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:49.240
and the precision to which
I want the answer.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:54.870
Next lecture, we'll look at a,
what's wrong with this one,

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.140
and I would ask you to between
now and the next lecture,

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.830
think about it, see if you can
find the bug yourself, we'll

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:05.740
look first for the bug, and then
after that, we'll look at

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.820
a better method of finding
the answer.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.270
Thank you.
