00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.120
PROFESSOR ERIC GRIMSON: Last
time, we ended up, we sort of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.380
did this tag team thing,
Professor Guttag did the first

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200
half, I did the second half of
the lecture, and the second

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.430
half of the lecture, we
started talking about

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.610
complexity.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.170
Efficiency.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.560
Orders of growth.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.340
And that's what we're going to
spend today on, is talking

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.080
about that topic.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.300
I'm going to use it
to build over the

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.050
next couple of lectures.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.530
I want to remind you that we
were talking at a fairly high

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.450
level about complexity.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170
We're going to get down into
the weeds in a second here.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.680
But the things we were trying
to stress were that it's an

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.010
important design decision, when
you are coming up with a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.820
piece of code, as to what kind
of efficiency your code has.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.170
And the second thing that we
talked about is this idea that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.630
we want you to in fact learn
how to relate a choice you

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.296
make about a piece of
code to what the

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.640
efficiency is going to be.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670
So in fact, over the next thirty
or forty minutes, we're

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.920
going to show you a set of
examples of sort of canonical

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980
algorithms, and the different
classes of complexity.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.930
Because one of the things that
you want to do as a good

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.900
designer is to basically
map a new problem

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.890
into a known domain.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.460
You want to take a new problem
and say, what does

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.490
this most look like?

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.390
What is the class of algorithm
that's-- that probably applies

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.380
to this, and how do I pull
something out of that, if you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.230
like, a briefcase of possible
algorithms to solve?

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.350
All right, having said that,
let's do some examples.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.540
I'm going to show you a sequence
of algorithms,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.680
they're mostly simple
algorithms, that's OK.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.410
But I want you to take away from
this how we reason about

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.200
the complexity of these
algorithms. And I'll remind

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.960
you, we said we're going to
mostly talk about time.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.530
We're going to be counting the
number of basic steps it takes

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.150
to solve the problem.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.520
So here's the first example
I want to do.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.390
I'm going to write a function
to compute integer power

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.860
exponents. a to the b where
b is an integer.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.210
And I'm going to do it only
using multiplication and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.010
addition and some simple tests.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.680
All right?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.290
And yeah, I know it comes built
in, that's OK, what we

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.410
want to do is use it as an
example to look at it.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.960
So I'm going to build something
that's going to do

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.920
iterative exponentiation.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.950
OK?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.980
And in fact, if you look at the
code up here, and it's on

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.300
your handout, the very first
one, x 1, right here-- if I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.400
could ask you to look at it--
is a piece of code to do it.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.980
And I'm less interested in the
code than how we're going to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.670
analyze it, but let's look
at it for a second.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.300
All right, you can see that
this little piece of code,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.390
it's got a loop in there,
and what's it doing?

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.380
It's basically cycling
through the loop,

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.050
multiplying by a each time.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.750
So first time through the
loop, the answer is 1.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.860
Second time it-- sorry, as it
enters the loop, at the time

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.260
it enter-- exits,
the answer is a.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.080
Next time through the loop
it goes to a squared.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.620
Next time through the loop
it goes to a cubed.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.420
And it's just gathering together
the multiplications

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.090
while counting down
the exponent.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240
And you can see it when we get
down to the end test here,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.990
we're going to pop out of
there and we're going to

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.190
return the answer.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.810
I could run it, it'll
do the right thing.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.830
What I want to think about
though, is, how much

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.970
time does this take?

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.040
How many steps does it take
for this function to run?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.500
Well, you can kind of
look at it, right?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.000
The key part of that
is that WHILE loop.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.450
And what are the steps
I want to count?

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.810
They're inside that loop--

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.530
I've got the wrong glasses so
I'm going to have to squint--

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.640
and we've got one test which
is a comparison, we've got

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.050
another test which is a
multiplication-- sorry, not a

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.850
test, we've got another step
which is a multiplication--

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.360
and another step that
is a subtraction.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.350
So each time through the loop,
I'm doing three steps.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.430
Three basic operations.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.930
How many times do I go
through the loop?

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.330
Somebody help me out.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.870
Hand up?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.140
Sorry. b times.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.740
You're right.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.706
Because I keep counting down
each time around-- mostly I've

00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:59.480
got to unload this candy, which
is driving me nuts, so--

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.560
thank you. b times.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.430
So I've got to go 3 b steps.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.830
All right, I've got to go
through the loop b times, I've

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.730
got three steps each time, and
then when I pop out of the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.280
loop, I've got two more steps.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.150
All right, I've got the
initiation of answer and the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.730
return of it.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.050
So I take 2 plus 3 b steps
to go through this loop.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.390
OK.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.910
So if b is 300, it takes 902
steps. b is 3000, it takes

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.995
9002 steps. b is 30,000
you get the point, it

00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:35.520
takes 90,002 steps.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.780
OK.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.860
So the point here is, first of
all, I can count these things,

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.750
but the second thing you can
see is, as the size of the

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.240
problems get larger, that
additive constant, that 2,

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.600
really doesn't matter.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.770
All right?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.480
The difference between 90,000
steps and 90,002 steps, who

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.210
cares about the 2, right?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.220
So, and typically, we're not
going to worry about those

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.980
additive constants.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.260
The second one is, this
multiplicative constant here

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.620
is 3, in some sense also
isn't all that crucial.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.860
Does it really matter to you
whether your code is going to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.350
take 300 years or 900
years to run?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.880
Problem is, how big
is that number?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.570
So we're going to typically
also not worry about the

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.880
multiplicative constants.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.280
This factor here.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.190
What we really want to worry
about is, as the size of the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.170
problem gets larger, how
does this thing grow?

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.090
How does the cost go up?

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.030
And so what we're going to
primarily talk about as a

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:46.310
consequence is the rate of
growth as the size of the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.200
problem grows.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.890
If it was, how much bigger does
this get as I make the

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.450
problem bigger?

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.560
And what that really says is,
that we're going to use this

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.720
using something we're
going to just

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.170
call asymptotic notation--

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.820
I love spelling this word--
meaning, as in the limit as

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.340
the size of the problem gets
bigger, how do I characterize

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.820
this growth?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.870
All right?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.820
You'll find out, if you go on
to some of the other classes

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.390
in course 6, there are a lot of
different ways that you can

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.950
measure this.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.280
The most common one, and the
one we're going to use, is

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.990
what's often called
big Oh notation.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.430
This isn't big Oh as in, oh my
God I'm shocked the markets

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.130
are collapsing, This is called
big Oh because we use the

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.950
Greek letter, capital letter,
omicron to represent it.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.500
And the way we're going to do
this, or what this represents,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.540
let me write this carefully for
you, big Oh notation is

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:53.450
basically going to be an upper
limit to the growth of a

00:06:53.450 --> 00:07:00.690
function as the input grow--
as the input gets large.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:06.020
Now we're going to see a bunch
of examples, and I know those

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.080
are words, let me give
you an example.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:16.690
I would write f of x is in
big Oh of n squared.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.360
And what does it say?

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.160
It says that function, f of x,
is bounded above, there's an

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.940
upper limit on it, that this
grows no faster than quadratic

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.130
in n, n squared.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.440
OK.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.190
And first of all, you say,
wait a minute, x and n?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.430
Well, one of the things we're
going to see is x is the input

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.860
to this particular problem, n is
a measure of the size of x.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.280
And we're going to talk about
how we come up with that. n

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.830
measures the size of x.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.450
OK.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.030
In this example I'd use b.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.250
All right, as b get-- b is the
thing that's changing as I go

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.700
along here, but it could be
things like, how many elements

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.830
are there in a list if the input
is a list, could be how

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.700
many digits are there in a
string if the input's a

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.630
string, it could be the size of
the integer as we go along.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:02.690
All right.?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.810
And what we want to do then, is
we want to basically come

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.020
up with, how do we characterize
the growth--

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.630
God bless you-- of this problem
in terms of this

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.660
quadra-- sorry, terms of
this exponential growth

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.540
Now, one last piece of math.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.260
I could cheat.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.070
I said I just want
an upper bound.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.440
I could get a really big upper
bound, this thing grows

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.720
exponentially.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.970
That doesn't help me much.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.910
Usually what I want to talk
about is what's the smallest

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.420
size class in which this
function grows?

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.890
With all of that, what that
says, is that this we would

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.100
write is order b.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.910
That algorithm is linear.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.740
You can see it.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.310
I've said the product
was is 2 plus 3 b.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.070
As I make b really large, how
does this thing grow?

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.480
It grows as b.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.620
The 3 doesn't matter, it's
just a constant,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.590
it's growing linearly.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.570
Another way of saying it is,
if I, for example, increase

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.480
the size of the input by
10, the amount of time

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480
increases by 10.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.610
And that's a sign that
it's linear.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.150
OK.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.450
So there's one quick example.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.260
Let's look at another example.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.200
If you look at x 2, this one
right here in your handout.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.580
OK.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.360
This is another way of doing
exponentiation, but this one's

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.550
a recursive function.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.820
All right?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.730
So again, let's look at it.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.620
What does it say to do?

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.220
Well, it's basically saying
a similar thing.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.060
It says, if I am in the base
case, if b is equal to 1, the

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.800
answer is just a.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.280
I could have used if b is equal
to 0, the answer is 1,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.490
that would have also worked.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.060
Otherwise, what do I say?

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.600
I say, ah, I'm in a nice
recursive way, a to the b is

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:41.230
the same as a times a
to the b minus 1.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.610
And I've just reduced that
problem to a simpler version

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.050
of the same problem.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.340
OK, and you can see that this
thing ought to unwrap, it's

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.560
going to keep extending out
those multiplications until

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.490
gets down to the base
case, going to

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.650
collapse them all together.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:53.960
OK.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.180
Now I want to know what's the
order of growth here?

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.130
What's the complexity of this?

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.040
Well, gee.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.170
It looks like it's pretty
straightforward, right?

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.670
I've got one test there, and
then I've just got one thing

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.310
to do here, which has got
a subtraction and a

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.930
multiplication.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.470
Oh, but how do I know how
long it takes to do x 2?

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.930
All right, we were counting
basic steps.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.380
We don't know how long
it takes to do x 2.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.230
So I'm going to show you
a little trick for

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.050
figuring that out.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.802
And in particular, I'm going to
cheat slightly, I'm going

00:10:25.802 --> 00:10:28.200
to use a little bit of abusive
mathematics, but I'm going to

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.110
show you a trick to
figure it out.

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:36.130
In the case of a recursive
exponentiator, I'm going to do

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:36.890
the following trick.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.890
I'm going to let t of b be the
number of steps it takes to

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.750
solve the problem of size b.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.520
OK, and I can figure this out.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.140
I've got one test, I've got
a subtraction, I've got a

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:55.670
multiplication, that's three
steps, plus whatever number of

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.100
steps it takes to solve a
problem of size b minus 1.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.480
All right, this is what's called
a recurrence relation,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.370
there are actually cool
ways to solve them.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.080
We can kind of eyeball it.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.130
In particular, how would I
write an expression for

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.100
t of b minus 1?

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.270
Well the same way.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.230
This is 3 plus 3 plus
t of b minus 2.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.690
Right?

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.980
I'm using exactly the same
form to reduce this.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.350
You know, you can see what's
going to happen.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.590
If I reduce that, it would be
3 plus t of b minus 3, so in

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:33.660
general, this is 3 k plus
t of b minus k.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:33.830
OK.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.370
I'm just expanding it out.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.320
When am I done?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.580
How do I stop this?

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.670
Any suggestions?

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.360
Don't you hate it when
professors ask questions?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.830
Yeah.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.070
Actually, I think I want
b minus k equal to 1.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:52.720
Right?

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.990
When this gets down to t of
1, I'm in the base case.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:01.550
So I'm done when b minus
k equals 1, or k

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.010
equals b minus 1.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.900
Right, that gets me down to the
base case, I'm solving a

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.800
problem with size 1, and in that
case, I've got two more

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.730
operations to do, so I plug this
all back in, I-- t of b

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:19.840
is I'm going to put k for b
minus 1 I get 3 b minus 1 plus

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.050
t of 1, so t of 1 is 2, so this
is 3 b minus 1 plus 2, or

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.670
3 b minus 1.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:30.900
OK.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.560
A whole lot of work
to basically say,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.740
again, order b is linear.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.510
But that's also nice, it lets
you see how the recursive

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.930
thing is simply unwrapping but
the complexity in terms of the

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.460
amount of time it takes is
going to be the same.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.310
I owe you a candy.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.110
Thank you.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.510
OK.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.440
At this point, if we stop,
you'll think all algorithms

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:53.820
are linear.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.410
This is really boring.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.450
But they're not.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:56.540
OK?

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.540
So let me show you another way
I could do exponentiation.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.880
Taking an advantage
of a trick.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:08.200
I want to solve a to the b.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.080
Here's another way
I could do that.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.400
OK.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:23.040
If b is even, then a to the b
is the same as a squared all

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.020
to the b over 2.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.820
All right, just move
the 2's around.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.470
It's the same thing.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.270
You're saying, OK, so what?

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.370
Well gee, notice.

00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.500
This is a primitive operation.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.280
That's a primitive operation.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.910
But in one step, I've reduced
this problem in half.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.340
I didn't just make
it one smaller, I

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.850
made it a half smaller.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.840
That's a nice deal.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.180
OK.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.870
But I'm not always going
to have b as even.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.810
If b is odd, what do I do?

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:56.490
Well, go back to what
I did before.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.870
Multiply a by a to
the b minus 1.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:00.980
You know, that's nice, right?

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.770
Because if b was odd, then b
minus one is even, which means

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.740
on the next step, I can cut
the problem in half again.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.210
OK?

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:17.160
All right. x 3, as you can see
right here, does exactly that.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.760
OK?

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.290
You can take a quick look at
it, even with the wrong

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.850
glasses on, it says if a--
sorry, b is equal to 1, I'm

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.740
just going to return a.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.860
Otherwise there's that funky
little test. I'll do the

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.580
remainder multiplied by 2,
because these are integers,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.580
that gives me back an integer,
I just check to see if it's

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.710
equal to b, that tells me
whether it's even or odd.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.420
And in the even case, I'd
square, divide by half, call

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:41.790
this again: in the odd case,
I go b minus 1 and

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.210
then multiply by a.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.190
I'll let you chase it through,
it does work.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.260
What I want to look
at is, what's the

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.030
order of growth here?

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.690
This is a little different,
right?

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.890
It's going to take a little bit
more work, so let's see if

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.270
we can do it.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.400
In the b even case, again I'm
going to let t of b be the

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.750
number of steps I want
to go through.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.610
And we can kind of eyeball
this thing, right?

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.470
If b is even, I've got a test to
see if b is equal to 1, and

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.880
then I've got to do the
remainder, the multiplication,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.160
and the test, I'm up to four.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.240
And then in the even case, I've
got to do a square and

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:17.830
the divide.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:24.670
So I've got six steps, plus
whatever it takes to solve the

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.950
problem size b over 2, right?

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:33.450
Because that's the recursive
call. b as odd, well I can go

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.940
through the same
kind of thing.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.610
I've got the same first four
steps, I've got a check to see

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.130
is it 1, I got a check to see if
it's even, and then in the

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.500
odd case, I've got to subtract 1
from b, that's a fifth step,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.560
I've got to go off and solve
the recursive problem, and

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.810
then I'm going to do one more
multiplication, so it's 6

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.320
plus, in this case,
t of b minus 1.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.500
Because it's now solving
a one-smaller problem.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.240
On the next step though, this,
we get substituted by that.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.190
Right, on the next step, I'm
back in the even case, it's

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:09.150
going to take six more steps,
plus t of b minus 1.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.580
Oops, sorry about
that, over 2.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.490
Because b minus 1 is now even.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.250
Don't sweat the details here,
I just want you to see the

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:17.930
reason it goes through it.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.350
What I now have, though,
is a nice thing.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:25.510
It says, in either case, in
general, t of b-- and this is

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.740
where I'm going to abuse
notation a little bit-- but I

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:33.900
can basically bound it by t, 12
steps plus t of b over 2.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.710
And the abuse is, you know,
it's not quite right, it

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:36.900
depends upon whether it's all
ready, but you can see in

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.605
either case, after 12 steps, 2
runs through this and down to

00:16:39.605 --> 00:16:41.200
a problem size b over 2.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.830
Why's that nice?

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:49.150
Well, that then says after
another 12 steps, we're down

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.570
to a problem with size
t of b over 4.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:59.875
And if I pull it out one more
level, it's 12 plus 12 plus t

00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:04.590
of b over 8, which in general is
going to be, after k steps,

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.390
12 k because I'll have 12 of
those to add up, plus t of b

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:13.570
over 2 to the k.

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.840
When am I done?

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.060
When do I get down
to the base case?

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.650
Somebody help me out.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.350
What am I looking for?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.790
Yeah.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.240
You're jumping slightly ahead of
me, but basically, I'm done

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.760
when this is equal
to 1, right?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.790
Because I get down to the base
case, so I'm done when b u is

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.010
over 2 to the k is equal to 1,
and you're absolutely right,

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:44.400
that's when k is log
base 2 of b.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.170
You're sitting a long ways back,
I have no idea if I'll

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.170
make it this far or not.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.040
Thank you.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.250
OK.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.800
There's some constants
in there, but this

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.550
is order log b.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.490
Logarithmic.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.040
This matters.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.000
This matters a lot.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.610
And I'm going to show you an
example in a second, just to

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.650
drive this home, but notice
the characteristics.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.570
In the first two cases,
the problem reduced

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.970
by 1 at each step.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.150
Whether it was recursive
or iterative.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.710
That's a sign that it's
probably linear.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.800
This case, I reduced the size
of the problem in half.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.920
It's a good sign that this is
logarithmic, and I'm going to

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.010
come back in a second to why
logs are a great thing.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.410
Let me show you one more class,
though, about-- sorry,

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.130
let me show you two more classes
of algorithms. Let's

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.900
look at the next one g-- and
there's a bug in your handout,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.210
it should be g of n and m, I
apologize for that, I changed

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:40.170
it partway through and
didn't catch it.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:40.490
OK.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:45.530
Order of growth here.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.960
Anybody want to volunteer
a guess?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.830
Other than the TAs, who know?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:54.300
OK.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.470
Let's think it through.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:57.330
I've got two loops.

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.710
All right?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.530
We already saw with one of the
loops, you know, it looked

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.350
like it might be linear,
depending on what's inside of

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.350
it, but let's think
about this.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.200
I got two loops with g.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.060
What's g do?

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.260
I've got an initialization of
x, and then I say, for i in

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.740
the range, so that's basically
from 0 up to n minus

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.250
1, what do I do?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.080
Well, inside of there, I've got
another loop, for j in the

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.870
range from 0 up to m minus 1.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.980
What's the complexity
of that inner loop?

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.730
Sorry?

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.260
OK.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.400
You're doing the whole
thing for me.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.700
What's the complexity just
of this inner loop here?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.250
Just this piece.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:36.260
How many times do I go
through that loop? m.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:36.440
Right?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.050
I'm going to get back to your
answer in a second, because

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.100
you're heading in the
right direction.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.440
The inner loop, this part
here, I do m times.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.520
There's one step inside of it.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.160
Right?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.900
How many times do I go
through that loop?

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.230
Ah, n times, because for each
value of i, I'm going to do

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.830
that m thing, so that is, close
to what you said, right?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.460
The order complexity here, if
I actually write it, would

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:08.530
be-- sorry, order n times m, and
if m was equal to n, that

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:14.860
would be order n squared,
and this is quadratic.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:19.660
And that's a different
behavior.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.180
OK.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.420
What am I doing?

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.050
Building up examples of
algorithms. Again, I want you

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.460
to start seeing how to map the
characteristics of the code--

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.110
the characteristics of the
algorithm, let's not call it

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.850
the code-- to the complexity.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.300
I'm going to come back to that
in a second with that, but I

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.850
need to do one more example,
and I've got to use my

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.660
high-tech really expensive
props.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.060
Right.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.880
So here's the fourth or fifth,
whatever we're up to, I guess

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.330
fifth example.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.620
This is an example of a problem

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.580
called Towers of Hanoi.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.840
Anybody heard about
this problem?

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.520
A few tentative hands.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.100
OK.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.180
Here's the story as
I am told it.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.470
There's a temple in the
middle of Hanoi.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.150
In that temple, there
are three very large

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.390
diamond-encrusted posts, and on
those posts are sixty-four

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.950
disks, all of a different
size.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.170
And they're, you know, covered
with jewels and all sorts of

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.170
other really neat stuff.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.410
There are a set of priests in
that temple, and their task is

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:15.470
to move the entire stack of
sixty-four disks from one post

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:19.380
to a second post. When they do
this, you know, the universe

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.740
ends or they solve the financial
crisis in Washington

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.470
or something like that actually
good happens, right?

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.690
Boy, none of you have 401k's,
you're not even wincing at

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.010
that thing.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.210
All right.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.930
The rules, though, are, they
can only move one disk at a

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.500
time, and they can never cover
up a smaller disk with a

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.980
larger disk.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.120
OK.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.720
Otherwise you'd just move the
whole darn stack, OK?

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.030
So we want to solve
that problem.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.780
We want to write a piece of
code that helps these guys

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.850
out, so I'm going to show
you an example.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.490
Let's see if we can figure
out how to do this.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.240
So, we'll start with
the easy one.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.160
Moving a disk of size 1.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.240
OK, that's not so bad.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.700
Moving a stack of size 2, if I
want to go there, I need to

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.980
put this one temporarily over
here so I can move the bottom

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.380
one before I move it over.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.920
Moving a stack of size 3, again,
if I want to go over

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.800
there, I need to make sure I
can put the spare one over

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.850
here before I move the bottom
one, I can't cover up any of

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.350
the smaller ones with
the larger one, but

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:09.200
I can get it there.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.110
Stack of size 4, again I'm going
there, so I'm going to

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.620
do this initially, no I'm not,
I'm going to start again.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.800
I'm going to go there initially,
so I can move this

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.980
over here, so I can get the base
part of that over there,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.290
I want to put that one there
before I put this over here,

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.145
finally I get to the point where
I can move the bottom

00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:26.330
one over, now I've got to be
really careful to make sure

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.350
that I don't cover up the bottom
one in the wrong way

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:30.980
before I get to the stage where
I wish they were posts

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.590
and there you go.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.520
All right?

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.510
I mean, I can make money at
Harvard Square doing this

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.420
stuff, right?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.140
All right, you ready
to do five?

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.470
Got the solution?

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.350
Not so easy to see.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.210
All right, but this is actually
a great one of those

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.270
educational moments.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.200
This is a great example
to think recursively.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.320
If I wanted to think about this
problem recursively--

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.530
what do I mean by thinking
recursively?

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.020
How do I reduce this to a
smaller-size problem in the

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.160
same instant?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.610
And so, if I do that, this
now becomes really easy.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.070
If I want to move this stack
here, I'm going to take a

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:10.990
stack of size n minus 1, move
it to the spare spot, now I

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:13.970
can move the base disk over,
and then I'm going to move

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.300
that stack of size n
minus 1 to there.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.270
That's literally
what I did, OK?

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.760
So there's the code.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.460
Called towers.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.020
I'm just going to have you--
let you take a look at it.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.990
I'm giving it an argument,
which is the size of the

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.730
stack, and then just labels
for the three posts.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.540
A from, a to, and a spare.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.330
And in fact, if we look at
this-- let me just pop it over

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.930
to the other side--

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:44.400
OK, I can move a tower, I'll say
of size 2, from, to, and

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.170
spare, and that was
what I did.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:55.540
And if I want to move towers,
let's say, size 5, from, to,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:01.140
and spare, there are
the instructions

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.860
for how to move it.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.330
We ain't going to
do sixty-four.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.720
OK.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.020
All right.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.100
So it's fun, and I got a little
bit of applause out of

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.030
it, which is always nice for me,
but I also showed you how

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.420
to think about it recursively.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:16.290
Once you hear that description,
it's easy to

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.440
write the code, in fact.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.430
This is a place where the
recursive version of it is

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.760
much easier to think about
than the iterative one.

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.380
But what I really want to talk
about is, what's the order of

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:25.820
growth here?

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.830
What's the complexity
of this algorithm?

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.550
And again, I'm going to do it
with a little bit of abusive

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.560
notation, and it's a little more
complicated, but we can

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.370
kind of look at.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.890
All right?

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.000
Given the code up there, if I
want to move a tower of size

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.090
n, what do I have to do?

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:47.050
I've got to test to see if I'm
in the base case, and if I'm

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:52.230
not, then I need to move a tower
of size n minus 1, I

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.360
need to move a tower of size
1, and I need to move a

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.050
second-- sorry about that--
a second tower of

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.000
size n minus 1.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.910
OK. t of 1 I can also reduce.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.540
In the case of a tower of size
1, basically there are two

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.290
things to do, right?

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.460
I've got to do the test, and
then I just do the move.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:16.420
So the general formula is that.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.020
Now.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.580
You might look at that and say,
well that's just a lot

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.450
like what we had over here.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:22.610
Right?

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:25.880
We had some additive constant
plus a simpler version of the

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.070
same problem reduced
in size by 1.

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.110
But that two matters.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.780
So let's look at it.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.900
How do I rea-- replace the
expression FOR t of n minus 1?

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.650
Substitute it in again. t
of n minus 1 is 3 plus 2

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:40.950
t of n minus 2.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:49.890
So this is 3, plus 2 times
3, plus 4 t minus 2.

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.410
OK.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.640
And if I substitute it again, I
get 3 plus 2 times 3 plus 4

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.850
times 3 plus 8 t n minus 3.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.610
This is going by a little
fast. I'm just

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.500
substituting in.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.090
I'm going to skip some steps.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.210
But basically if I do this, I
end up with 3 times 1 plus 2

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.590
plus 4 to 2 to the k
minus 1 for all of

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.120
those terms, plus 2--

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:30.960
I want to do this right, 2 to
the k, sorry-- t of n minus k.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.250
OK.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.620
Don't sweat the details, I'm
just expanding it out.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.720
What I want you to see is,
because I've got two versions

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.130
of that problem.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.660
The next time down I've
got four versions.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.980
Next time down I've got
eight versions.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.510
And in fact, if I substitute, I
can solve for this, I'm done

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.150
when this is equal to 1.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.500
If you substitute it all
in, you get basically

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:54.850
order 2 to the n.

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.590
Exponential.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.850
That's a problem.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.250
Now, it's also the case that
this is fundamentally what

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.370
class this algorithm falls
into, it is going to take

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.160
exponential amount of time.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.120
But it grows pretty rapidly, as
n goes up, and I'm going to

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.460
show you an example
in a second.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.290
Again, what I want you
to see is, notice the

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.710
characteristic of that.

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:21.240
That this recursive call had two
sub-problems of a smaller

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.450
size, not one.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.490
And that makes a
big difference.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.530
So just to show you how big a
difference it makes, let's run

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.810
a couple of numbers.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:33.410
Let's suppose n is 1000,
and we're running

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.770
at nanosecond speed.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:52.550
We have seen log, linear,
quadratic, and exponential.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:55.320
So, again, there could be
constants in here, but just to

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.980
give you a sense of this.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.850
If I'm running at nanosecond
speed, n, the size of the

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.820
problem, whatever it is, is
1000, and I've got a log

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:08.940
algorithm, it takes 10
nanoseconds to complete.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.570
If you blink, you miss it.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:18.770
If I'm running a linear
algorithm, it'll take one

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.680
microsecond to complete.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.570
If I'm running a quadratic
algorithm, it'll take one

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:29.570
millisecond to complete.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.600
And if I'm running
an exponential

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.830
algorithm, any guesses?

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:50.310
I hope Washington doesn't take
this long to fix my 401k plan.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.460
All right?

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.250
10 to the 284 years.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.930
As Emeril would say, pow!

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.400
That's a some spicy whatever.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.600
All right.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.220
Bad jokes aside, what's
the point?

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.700
You see, these classes have
really different performance.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.990
Now this is a little
misleading.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.210
These are all really fast, so
just to give you another set

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.200
of examples, I'm not
going to do the--

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:17.600
If I had a problem where the log
one took ten milliseconds,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.340
then the linear one would take
a second, the quadratic one

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.880
would take 16 minutes.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.670
So you can see, even the
quadratic ones can

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.280
blow up in a hurry.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.820
And this goes back to
the point I tried

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.130
to make last time.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.360
Yes, the computers are really
fast. But the problems can

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.910
grow much faster than you can
get a performance boost out of

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:39.930
the computer.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.270
And you really, wherever
possible, want to avoid that

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.760
exponential algorithm, because
that's really deadly.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.660
Yes.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.520
All right.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.790
The question is, is there a
point where it'll quit.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.130
Yeah, when the power goes out,
or-- so let me not answer it

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.080
quite so facetiously.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.680
We'd be mostly talking
about time.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.890
In fact, if I ran one of these
things, it would just keep

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:01.930
crunching away.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.030
It will probably quit at some
point because of space issues,

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.130
unless I'm writing an algorithm
that is using no

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.670
additional space.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:09.250
Right.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.770
Those things are going to stack
up, and eventually it's

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:11.540
going to run out of space.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.730
And that's more likely to
happen, but, you know.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.280
The algorithm doesn't know that
it's going to take this

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.800
long to compute, it's just busy
crunching away, trying to

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.190
see if it can make it happen.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.860
OK.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.290
Good question, thank you.

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:26.010
All right.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:29.510
I want to do one more extended
example here., because we've

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.670
got another piece to do, but I
want to capture this, because

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.390
it's important, so let me
again try and say it the

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.610
following way.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:37.590
I want you to recognize classes
of algorithms and

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.420
match what you see in the
performance of the algorithm

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.680
to the complexity of
that algorithm.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.020
All right?

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:47.270
Linear algorithms tend to
be things where, at one

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.100
pass-through, you reduce
the problem by a

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.790
constant amount, by one.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.450
If you reduce it by two, it's
going to be the same thing.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.400
Where you go from problem of
size n to a problem of

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.460
size n minus 1.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.600
A log algorithm typically is one
where you cut the size of

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.750
the problem down by some
multiplicative factor.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.960
You reduce it in half.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.810
You reduce it in third.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.660
All right?

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.700
Quadratic algorithms
tend to have this--

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.640
I was about to say additive,
wrong term-- but

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.630
doubly-nested, triply-nested
things are likely to be

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.420
quadratic or cubic algorithms,
all right, because you know--

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.310
let me not confuse things--
double-loop quadratic

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.000
algorithm, because you're doing
one set of things and

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.360
you're doing it some other
number of times, and that's a

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.970
typical signal that that's
what you have there.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.390
OK.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:30.910
And then the exponentials, as
you saw is when typically I

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:36.200
reduce the problem of one size
into two or more sub-problems

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.930
of a smaller size.

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.970
And you can imagine this gets
complex and there's lots of

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.580
interesting things to do to
look to the real form, but

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.960
those are the things that
you should see.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.480
Now.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.790
Two other things, before we
do this last example.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.210
One is, I'll remind you, what
we're interested in is

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:51.800
asymptotic growth.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.040
How does this thing grow as I
make the problem size big?

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.950
And I'll also remind you, and
we're going to see this in the

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.480
next example, we talked
about looking at

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.530
the worst case behavior.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.610
In these cases there's no best
case worst case, it's just

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.800
doing one computation.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.570
We're going to see an example
of that in a second.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.850
What we really want to worry
about, what's the worst case

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.000
that happens.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.410
And the third thing I want you
to keep in mind is, remember

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.760
these are orders of growth.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.370
It is certainly possible, for
example, that a quadratic

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.810
algorithm could run faster
than a linear algorithm.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.330
It depends on what the input is,
it depends on, you know,

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.480
what the particular cases are.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.300
So it is not the case that,
on every input, a linear

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.590
algorithm is always
going to be better

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.140
than a quadratic algorithm.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.490
It is just in general that's
going to hold true, and that's

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.880
what I want you to see.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.260
OK.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.560
I want to do one last example.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:41.170
I'm going to take a little bit
more time on it, because it's

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.600
going to both reinforce these
ideas, but it's also going to

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.190
show us how we have to think
about what's a primitive

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.720
step., and in a particular,
how do data structures

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.760
interact with this analysis?

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.790
Here I've just been running
integers, it's pretty simple,

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.110
but if I have a data structure,
I'm going to have

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.320
to worry about that
a little bit more.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.130
So let's look at that.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:00.290
And the example I want to look
at is, suppose I want to

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:04.360
search a list that I know is
sorted, to see if an element's

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.920
in the list. OK?

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:17.875
So the example I'm going to
do, I'm going to search a

00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:20.850
sorted list. All right.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.250
If you flip to the second side
of your handout, you'll see

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.640
that I have a piece of code
there, that does this-- let

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.580
me, ah, I didn't want to
do that, let me back up

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.870
slightly-- this is the algorithm
called search.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.020
And let's take a look at it.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.050
OK?

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.730
Basic idea, before I even look
at the code, is pretty simple.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.960
If I've got a list that is
sorted, in let's call it, just

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.670
in increasing order, and I
haven't said what's in the

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.830
list, could be numbers, could
be other things, for now,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:46.800
we're going to just assume
they're integers.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.140
The easy thing to do would be
the following: start at the

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.010
front end of the list, check
the first element.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.130
If it's the thing I'm looking
for, I'm done.

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.740
It's there.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.010
If not, move on to
the next element.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:57.900
And keep doing that.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.690
But if, at any point, I get to
a place in the list where the

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:04.240
thing I'm looking for is smaller
than the element in

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.180
the list, I know everything else
in the rest of the list

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.530
has to be bigger than that,
I don't have to

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.710
bother looking anymore.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.724
It says the element's
not there.

00:34:10.724 --> 00:34:12.450
I can just stop.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:12.750
OK.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:14.550
So that's what this piece
of code does here.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:15.390
Right.?

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:17.700
I'm going to set up a variable
to say, what's the answer I

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.090
want to return, is
it there or not.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.200
Initially it's got that
funny value none.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.260
I'm going to set up an index,
which is going to tell me

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.990
where to look, starting at the
first part of the list, right?

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.630
And then, when I got--

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.810
I'm also going to count how many
comparisons I do, just so

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.230
I can see how much work
I do here, and then

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.010
notice what it does.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:40.330
It says while the index is
smaller than the size of the

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.840
list, I'm not at the end of the
list, and I don't have an

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.960
answer yet, check.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.660
So I'm going to check to see
if-- really can't read that

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.250
thing, let me do it this way--
right, I'm going to increase

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.890
the number of compares, and I'm
going to check to say, is

00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:57.250
the thing I'm looking for at
the i'th spot in the list?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.250
Right, so s of i saying, given
the list, look at the i'th

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.790
element, is it the same thing?

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.700
If it is, OK.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.590
Set the answer to true.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.900
Which means, next time through
the loop, that's going to pop

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.930
out and return an answer.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:17.490
If it's not, then check to see,
is it smaller than that

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.880
element in the current
spot of the list?

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.200
And if that's true, it says
again, everything else in the

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.600
list has to be bigger than this,
thing can't possibly be

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.790
in the list, I'm taking
advantage of the ordering, I

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.880
can set the answer to false,
change i to go to the next

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.956
one, and next time through the
loop, I'm going to pop out and

00:35:31.956 --> 00:35:34.140
print it out.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.800
OK?

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:37.490
Right.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.460
Order of growth here.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:46.650
What do you think?

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.840
Even with these glasses on,
I can see no hands up, any

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.600
suggestions?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.250
Somebody help me out.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.540
What do you think the order
of growth is here?

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:58.300
I've got a list, walk you
through it an element at a

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.780
time, do I look at each
element of the

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.890
list more than once?

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.600
Don't think so, right?

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.970
So, what does this suggest?

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.100
Sorry?

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.420
Constant.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.910
Ooh, constant says, no matter
what the length of the list

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.630
is, I'm going to take the
same amount of time.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.890
And I don't think that's
true, right?

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.080
If I have a list ten times
longer, it's going to take me

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.890
more time, so-- not a
bad guess, I'm still

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.190
reward you, thank you.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.080
Somebody else.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.500
Yeah.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:30.930
Linear.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:31.930
Why?

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:39.290
You're right, by the
way, but why?

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.140
Yeah.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.880
All right, so the answer was
it's linear, which is

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.710
absolutely right.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.730
Although for a reason
we're going to

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.620
come back in a second.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.450
Oh, thank you, I hope your
friends help you out with

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:49.920
that, thank you.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.670
Right?

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.290
You can see that this
ought to be linear,

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.200
because what am I doing?

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.220
I'm walking down the list. So
one of the things I didn't

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.350
say, it's sort of implicit here,
is what is the thing I

00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.700
measuring the size of
the problem in?

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.450
What's the size of the list?

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:08.230
And if I'm walking down the
list, this is probably order

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.910
of the length of the list s,
because I'm looking at each

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.210
element once.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:14.840
Now you might say,
wait a minute.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.300
Thing's ordered, if I stop part
way through and I throw

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.760
away half the list, doesn't
that help me?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.430
And the answer is yes, but it
doesn't change the complexity.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.960
Because what did we say?

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.150
We're measuring the
worst case.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.300
The worst case here is, the
things not in the list, in

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.520
which case I've got to go all
the way through the list to

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.220
get to the end.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.390
OK.

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:37.110
Now, having said that, and I've
actually got a subtlety

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.500
I'm going to come back to in a
second, there ought to be a

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.810
better way to do this.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:41.370
OK?

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:47.180
And here's the better
way to think about.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.640
I'll just draw out sort of a
funny representation of a

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.780
list. These are sort of the
cells, if you like, in memory

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.060
that are holding the elements
of the list. What we've been

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.020
saying is, I start
here and look.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.900
If it's there, I'm done.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.030
If not, I go there.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.600
If it's there, I'm done, if not,
I keep walking down, and

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.240
I only stop when I get to a
place where the element I'm

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.150
looking for is smaller than
the value in the list., in

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.870
which case I know the
rest of this is too

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:13.650
big and I can stop.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.080
But I still have to go
through the list.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.830
There's a better way to think
about this, and in fact

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.600
Professor Guttag has already
hinted at this in the last

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.180
couple of lectures.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.740
The better way to think about
this is, suppose, rather than

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:26.900
starting at the beginning, I
just grabbed some spot at

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.880
random, like this one.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.120
And I look at that value.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.340
If it's the value I'm looking
for, boy, I ought to go to

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:35.630
Vegas, I'm really lucky.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.840
And I'm done, right?

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.330
If not, what could I do?

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.780
Well, I could look at the value
here, and compare it to

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.690
the value I'm trying to find,
and say the following; if the

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:51.010
value I'm looking for is bigger
than this value, where

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:53.240
do I need to look?

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:53.760
Just here.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.940
All right?

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.580
Can't possibly be there,
because I know

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.080
this thing is over.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.460
On the other hand, if the value
I'm looking for here--

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.810
sorry, the value I'm looking for
is smaller than the value

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.350
I see here, I just need
to look here.

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.730
All right?

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.030
Having done that, I could do the
same thing, so I suppose I

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.040
take this branch, I can pick a
spot like, say, this one, and

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.260
look there.

00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.180
Because there, I'm done,
if not, I'm either

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.750
looking here or there.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:31.350
And I keep cutting
the problem down.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:31.760
OK.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.400
Now, having said that, where
should I pick to

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.220
look in this list?

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.630
I'm sorry?

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.270
Halfway.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.580
Why?

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:50.060
You're right, but why?

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:50.660
Yeah.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.250
So the answer, in case you
didn't hear it, was, again, if

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.800
I'm a gambling person, I could
start like a way down here.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.220
All right?

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.320
If I'm gambling, I'm saying,
gee, if I'm really lucky,

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.220
it'll be only on this side, and
I've got a little bit of

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:03.910
work to do, but if I'm unlucky,
I'm scrawed, the past

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.690
pluperfect of screwed, OK.,
or a Boston fish.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.140
I'll look at the rest of that
big chunk of the list, and

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.290
that's a pain.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:15.480
So halfway is the right thing
to do, because at each step,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.850
I'm guaranteed to throw away at
least half the list. Right?

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.640
And that's nice.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.010
OK.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:25.060
What would you guess the order
of growth here is?

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:26.360
Yeah.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.590
Why?

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:29.970
Good.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:30.520
Exactly.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:30.920
Right?

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.570
Again, if you didn't hear it,
the answer was it's log.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.700
Because I'm cutting down the
problem in half at each time.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.890
You're right, but there's
something we have to do to add

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.800
to that, and that's the last
thing I want to pick up on.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.370
OK.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.610
Let's look at the code--
actually, let's test this out

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.090
first before we do it.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:47.895
So I've added, as Professor
Guttag did-- ah, should have

00:40:47.895 --> 00:40:51.130
said it this way, let's write
the code for it first, sorry

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.810
about that--

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.970
OK, I'm going to write a little
thing called b search.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.680
I'm going to call it down here
with search, which is simply

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.290
going to call it, and then
print an answer out.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.240
In binary search-- ah, there's
that wonderful phrase, this is

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.560
called a version of binary
search, just like you saw

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.970
bin-- or bi-section methods,
when we were doing numerical

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:11.090
things-- in binary search, I
need to keep track of the

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:13.570
starting point and the
ending point of the

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.320
list I'm looking at.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.730
Initially, it's the beginning
and the end of it.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.805
And when I do this test, what I
want to do, is say I'm going

00:41:18.805 --> 00:41:21.780
to pick the middle spot, and
depending on the test, if I

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.560
know it's in the upper half, I'm
going to set my start at

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.710
the mid point and the end stays
the same, if it's in the

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.583
front half I'm going to keep
the front the same and I'm

00:41:29.583 --> 00:41:30.860
going to change the endpoint.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:33.350
And you can see that
in this code here.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.130
Right?

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.940
What does it say to do?

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.850
It says, well I'm going to print
out first and last, just

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.240
so you can see it, and then I
say, gee, if last minus first

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.330
is less than 2, that is, if
there's no more than two

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.710
elements left in the list, then
I can just check those

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:50.380
two elements, and return
the answer.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.700
Otherwise, we find
the midpoint, and

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.590
notice what it does.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.620
First, it's pointing to the
beginning of the list, which

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.160
initially might be down here at
0 but after a while, might

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.800
be part way through.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.390
And to that, I simply
add a halfway

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.000
point, and then I check.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.880
If it's at that point, I'm done,
if not, if it's greater

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.340
than the value I'm looking
for, I either take

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.180
one half or the other.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:15.510
OK.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.270
You can see that thing is
cutting down the problem in

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.380
half each time, which is good,
but there's one more thing I

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.070
need to deal with.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.250
So let's step through this
with a little more care.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.640
And I keep saying, before
we do it, let's just

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.390
actually try it out.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:27.110
So I'm going to go over
here, and I'm going

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.590
to type test search--

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:33.240
I can type-- and if you look at
your handout, it's just a

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.130
sequence of tests that
I'm going to do.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:36.740
OK.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.300
So initially, I'm going to set
up the list to be the first

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.950
million integers.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.140
Yeah, it's kind of simple, but
it gives me an ordered list of

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.990
these things, And let's run it.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:46.020
OK.

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:48.310
So I'm first going to look for
something that's not in the

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.310
list, I'm going to see, is minus
1 in this list, so it's

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.070
going to be at the far end,
and if I do that in

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.510
the basic case, bam.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.790
Done.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.140
All right?

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.970
The basic, that primary search,
because it looks at

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.400
the first element, says
it's smaller than

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.850
everything else, I'm done.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:06.790
If I look in the binary case,
takes a little longer.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:07.840
Notice the printout here.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.280
The printout is simply telling
me, what are the

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:11.230
ranges of the search.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:15.030
And you can see it wrapping its
way down, cutting in half

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.250
at each time until it
gets there, but it

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.250
takes a while to find.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:18.520
All right.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.220
Let's search to see though now
if a million is in this list,

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.470
or 10 million, whichever way
I did this, it must be a

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:26.520
million, right?

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:31.150
In the basic case, oh,
took a little while.

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:35.180
Right, in the binary
case, bam.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.280
In fact, it took the same number
of steps as it did in

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.030
the other case, because
each time I'm cutting

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.710
it down by a half.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:41.040
OK.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.140
That's nice.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.930
Now, let's do the following;
if you look right here, I'm

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.400
going to set this now to--

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.780
I'm going to change my range
to 10 million, I'm going to

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:51.070
first say, gee, is a
million in there,

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:54.680
using the basic search.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.190
It is.

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.280
Now, I'm going to say, is 10
million in this, using the

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.310
basic search.

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.400
We may test your hypothesis,
about how long does it take,

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.580
if I time this really well, I
ought to be able to end when

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.610
it finds it, which should
be right about now.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.080
That was pure luck.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:14.400
But notice how much
longer it took.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.040
On the other hand, watch what
happens with binary.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.720
Is the partway one there?

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.810
Yeah.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.780
Is the last one there?

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:22.190
Wow.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.480
I think it took one more step.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.690
Man, that's exactly what
logs should do, right?

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:30.190
I make the problem ten times
bigger, it takes one

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:31.680
more step to do it.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.020
Whereas in the linear case, I
make it ten times bigger, it

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.660
takes ten times longer to run.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.480
OK.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.700
So I keep saying I've got one
thing hanging, it's the last

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.460
thing I want to do, but I wanted
you see how much of a

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.110
difference this makes.

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.030
But let's look a little more
carefully at the code for

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.160
binary search-- for search 1.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.560
What's the complexity
of search 1?

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.000
Well, you might say it's
constant, right?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.140
It's only got two things to do,
except what it really says

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.450
is, that the complexity of
search 1 is the same as the

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.060
complexity of b search,
because that's

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.210
the call it's doing.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:00.380
So let's look at b search.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.030
All right?

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.600
We've got the code for
b search up there.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.450
First step, constant, right?

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.970
Nothing to do.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:13.680
Second step, hm.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.480
That also looks constant,
you think?

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.280
Oh but wait a minute.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.200
I'm accessing s.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.290
I'm accessing a list. How long
does it take for me to get the

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:28.490
nth element of a list?

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.610
That might not be a
primitive step.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.480
And in fact, it depends
on how I store a list.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:42.620
So, for example, in this case,
I had lists that I knew were

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:44.620
made out of integers.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:50.820
As a consequence, I have
a list of ints.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.400
I might know, for example,
that it takes four memory

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.350
chunks to represent one
int, just for example.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:46:01.250
And to find the i'th element,
I'm simply going to take the

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.240
starting point, that point at
the beginning of memory where

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:10.850
the list is, plus 4 times i,
that would tell me how many

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:13.530
units over to go, and that's the
memory location I want to

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:15.720
look for the i'th element
of the list.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.890
And remember, we said we're
going to assume a random

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:21.730
access model, which says, as
long as I know the location,

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.680
it takes a constant amount of
time to get to that point.

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.800
So if the-- if I knew the
lists were made of just

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.100
integers, it'd be really
easy to figure it out.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.570
Another way of saying it is,
this takes constant amount of

00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.790
time to figure out where to
look, it takes constant amount

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.860
of time to get there, so in fact
I could treat indexing

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.630
into a list as being
a basic operation.

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.660
But we know lists can be
composed of anything.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.400
Could be ints, could be floats,
could be a combination

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.380
of things, some ints, some
floats, some lists, some

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.410
strings, some lists of
lists, whatever.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:58.970
And in that case, in general
lists, I need to figure out

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.270
what's the access time.

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.400
And here I've got a choice.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.660
OK, one of the ways I could
do would be the following.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:10.350
I could have a pointer to the
beginning of the list where

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:17.550
the first element here is the
actual value, and this would

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:23.810
point to the next element in
the list. Or another way of

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.610
saying it is, the first part
of the cell could be some

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.070
encoding of how many cells do
I need to have to store the

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:31.690
value, and then I've got some
way of telling me where to get

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:35.320
the next element of the list.
And this would point to value,

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:42.730
and this would point off
someplace in memory.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.480
Here's the problem with that
technique, and by the way, a

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.995
number of programming
languages use

00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:46.930
this, including Lisp.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.630
The problem with that technique,
while it's very

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:51.750
general, is how long does it
take me to find the i'th

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.240
element of the list?

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.410
Oh fudge knuckle.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.090
OK.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:58.910
I've got to go to the first
place, figure out how far over

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.030
to skip, go to the next place,
figure out how far over to

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.660
skip, eventually I'll
be out the door.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.620
I've got to count my way down,
which means that the access

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.120
would be linear in the length
of the list to find the i'th

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.720
element of the list, and that's
going to increase the

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.330
complexity.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.290
There's an alternative, which
is the last point I want to

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:22.180
make, which is instead what I
could do, I should have said

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.510
these things are called linked
lists, we'll come back to

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:29.540
those, another way to do it,
is to have the start of the

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:36.480
list be at some point in memory,
and to have each one

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.210
of the successive cells
in memory point off

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.340
to the actual value.

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.500
Which may take up some arbitrary
amount of memory.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.880
In that case, I'm back
to this problem.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.570
And as a consequence, access
time in the list is constant,

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:56.290
which is what I want.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.010
Now, to my knowledge, most
implementations of Python use

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:01.665
this way of storing lists,
whereas Lisp

00:49:01.665 --> 00:49:02.760
and Scheme do not.

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.950
The message I'm trying to get
to here, because I'm running

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.670
you right up against time, is
I have to be careful about

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.660
what's a primitive step.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.460
With this, if I can assume
that accessing the i'th

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.670
element of a list is constant,
then you can't see that the

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.790
rest of that analysis looks just
like the log analysis I

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:23.590
did before, and each step, no
matter which branch I'm

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.710
taking, I'm cutting the
problem down in half.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.250
And as a consequence,
it is log.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:35.920
And the last piece of this, is
as said, I have to make sure I

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.190
know what my primitive elements
are, in terms of

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.090
operations.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:44.660
Summary: I want you to recognize
different classes of

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.360
algorithms. I'm not going
to repeat them.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.870
We've seen log, we've seen
linear, we've seen quadratic,

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.790
we've seen exponential.

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.510
One of the things you should
begin to do, is to recognize

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:57.070
what identifies those classes of
algorithms, so you can map

00:49:57.070 --> 00:49:59.420
your problems into
those ranges.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.640
And with that, good
luck on Thursday.
