00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.980
PROFESSOR: Last time we were
talking about binary search

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.370
and I sort of left a promise
to you which I need to pick up.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.130
I want to remind
you, we were talking

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.999
about search, which is a very
fundamental thing that we do

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.290
in a whole lot of applications.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.930
We want to go find
things in some data set.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.650
And I'll remind you that we sort
of a separated out two cases.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.090
We said if we had
an ordered list,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.420
we could use binary search.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.660
And we said that was log
rhythmic, took log n time where

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.140
n is the size of the list.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.140
If it was an unordered
list, we were basically

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.574
stuck with linear search.

00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:04.990
Got to walk through
the whole list

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.198
to see if the thing is there.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:08.289
So that was of order in.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:10.080
And then one of the
things that I suggested

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.650
was that if we could figure
out some way to order it,

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:22.392
and in particular, if we could
order it in n log n time,

00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:24.100
and we still haven't
done that, but if we

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.670
could do that, then we
said the complexity changed

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.880
a little bit.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.020
But it changed in a way
that I want to remind you.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.810
And the change was,
that in this case,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.720
if I'm doing a single
search, I've got a choice.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.860
I could still do the linear
case, which is order n

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.170
or I could say, look, take
the list, let's sort it

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.480
and then search it.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.500
But in that case,
we said well to sort

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.710
it was going to take n log n
time, assuming I can do that.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.610
Once I have it sorted I can
search it in log n time,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.860
but that's still isn't
as good as just doing n.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.220
And this led to this
idea of amortization,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.172
which is I need to not
only factor in the cost,

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.380
but how am I going to use it?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.520
And typically, I'm not going
to just search once in a list,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.250
I'm going to search
multiple times.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.650
So if I have to do k searches,
then in the linear case,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.370
I got to do order
n things k times.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.070
It's order k n.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.390
Whereas in the ordered case,
I need to get them sorted,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.870
which is still n log n, but
then the search is only log n.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.880
I need to do k of those.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.600
And we suggested well
this is better than that.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.820
This is certainly
better than that.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.270
m plus k all times log n
is in general going to be

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.750
much better than k times n.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.300
It depends on n
and k but obviously

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.580
as n gets big, that one
is going to be better.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.330
And that's just a
way of reminding you

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.959
that we want to think
carefully, but what

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.750
are the things we're
trying to measure when

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.090
we talk about complexity here?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.480
It's both the size of
the thing and how often

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.540
are we going to use it?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.131
And there are some
trade offs, but I still

00:03:10.131 --> 00:03:11.880
haven't said how I'm
going to get an n log

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.560
n sorting algorithm, and
that's what I want to do today.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.030
One of the two things
I want to do today.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.610
To set the stage for
this, let's go back just

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.600
for a second to binary search.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.710
At the end of the lecture
I said binary search

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:39.660
was an example of a divide
and conquer algorithm.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.860
Sort of an Attila the
Hun kind of approach

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.940
to doing things if you like.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.140
So let me say -- boy, I
could have made a really bad

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.340
political joke there,
which I will forego, right.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.760
Let's say what this actually
means, divide and conquer.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.340
Divide and conquer says
basically do the following:

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:14.254
split the problem into several
sub-problems of the same type.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.670
I'll come back in
a second to help

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.800
binary searches matches
in that, but that's

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.880
what we're going to do.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.920
For each of those
sub-problems we're

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.710
going to solve
them independently,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.124
and then we're going to
combine those solutions.

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:36.540
And it's called divide and
conquer for the obvious reason.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.670
I'm going to divide it up into
sub-problems with the hope

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.152
that those sub-problems
get easier.

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:43.110
It's going to be easier
to conquer if you like,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.150
and then I'm going
to merge them back.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.840
Now, in the binary search
case, in some sense,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.140
this is a little bit trivial.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.480
What was the divide?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.715
The divide was breaking a big
search up into half a search.

00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:58.340
We actually threw
half of the list away

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.380
and we kept dividing it
down, until ultimately we

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.000
got something of
size one to search.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.770
That's really easy.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.510
The combination was also
sort of trivial in this case

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.930
because the solution
to the sub-problem

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.300
was, in fact, the solution
to the larger problem.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.940
But there's the idea
of divide and conquer.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.820
I'm going to use exactly that
same ideas to tackle sort.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.840
Again, I've got an unordered
list of n elements.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.010
I want to sort it into a
obviously a sorted list.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.270
And that particular
algorithm is actually

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.950
a really nice algorithm
called merge sort.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:37.800
And it's actually a
fairly old algorithm.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.720
It was invented in 1945 by John
von Neumann one of the pioneers

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.060
of computer science.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.050
And here's the idea
behind merge sort,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.960
actually I'm going to back
into it in a funny way.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.340
Let's assume that I could
somehow get to the stage

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.560
where I've got two sorted lists.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.171
How much work do I have to do
to actually merge them together?

00:06:04.171 --> 00:06:05.420
So let me give you an example.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:13.610
Suppose I want to merge two
lists, and they're sorted.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.190
Just to give you an
example, here's one list,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.830
3121724 Here's
another list, 12430.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.020
I haven't said how I'm going
to get those sorted lists,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.790
but imagine I had two
sorted lists like that.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.370
How hard is it to merge them?

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.940
Well it's pretty easy, right?

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.540
I start at the
beginning of each list,

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.820
and I say is one
less than three?

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.170
Sure.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.470
So that says one should be the
first element in my merge list.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.220
Now, compare the first element
in each of these lists.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.810
Two is less than
three, so two ought

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.910
to be the next
element of the list.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.920
And you get the idea.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.045
What am I going to do next?

00:06:57.045 --> 00:07:00.020
I'm going to compare
three against four.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.070
Three is the
smallest one, and I'm

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.260
going to compare
four games twelve,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.132
which is going to give me four.

00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:07.840
And then what do?

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.860
I have to do twelve against
thirty, twelve is smaller,

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.590
take that out.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:22.250
Seventeen against thirty,
twenty-four against thirty

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.100
And by this stage I've got
nothing left in this element,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.010
so I just add the
rest of that list in.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.300
Wow I can sort two lists,
so I can merge two lists.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.100
I said it poorly.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.110
What's the point?

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.000
How many operations did
it take me to do this?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.150
Seven comparisons, right?

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.150
I've got eight elements.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:47.290
It took me seven
comparisons, because I

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.020
can take advantage
of the fact I know

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.627
I only ever have to look at the
first element of each sub-list.

00:07:52.627 --> 00:07:54.460
Those are the only
things I need to compare,

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.365
and when I run out of one list,
I just add the rest of the list

00:07:57.365 --> 00:07:58.140
in.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.474
What's the order of
complexity of merging?

00:08:02.474 --> 00:08:03.890
I heard it somewhere
very quietly.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.217
STUDENT: n.

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:06.550
PROFESSOR: Sorry, and thank you.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.290
Linear, absolutely right?

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.517
And what's n by the way here?

00:08:10.517 --> 00:08:11.350
What's it measuring?

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.017
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:08:14.017 --> 00:08:15.350
PROFESSOR: In both lists, right.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:21.230
So this is linear, order n and
n is this sum of the element,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:30.590
or sorry, the number of
elements in each list.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.740
I said I was going to
back my way into this.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.410
That gives me a way
to merge things.

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:40.020
So here's what
merge sort would do.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:47.150
Merge sort takes this idea
of divide and conquer,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.610
and it does the
following: it says

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:58.440
let's divide the list in half.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.940
There's the divide and conquer.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.884
And let's keep dividing
each of those lists in half

00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:07.300
until we get down to something
that's really easy to sort.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.716
What's the simplest
thing to sort?

00:09:08.716 --> 00:09:12.220
A list of size one, right?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:26.820
So continue until we
have singleton lists.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.710
Once I got a list
of size one they're

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.140
sorted, and then combine them.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.060
Combine them by doing
emerge the sub-lists.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.540
And again, you see that flavor.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.640
I'm going to just
keep dividing it up

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.160
until I get something
really easy,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.410
and then I'm going to combine.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.070
And this is different
than binary search now,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.945
the combine is going to
have to do some work.

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:54.352
So, I'm giving you a piece
of code that does this,

00:09:54.352 --> 00:09:56.310
and I'm going to come
back to it in the second,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.405
but it's up there.

00:09:57.405 --> 00:09:58.780
But what I'd like
to do is to try

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.434
you sort sort of a
little simulation of how

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:02.100
this would work.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.850
And I was going to originally
make the TAs come up here

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.760
and do it, but I don't
have enough t a's

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.830
to do a full merge sort.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.380
So I'm hoping, so I also have
these really high-tech props.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.242
I spent tons and tons
of department money

00:10:12.242 --> 00:10:13.200
on them as you can see.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.250
I hope you can see this
because I'm going to try

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.750
and simulate what
a merge sort does.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.950
I've got eight things
I want to sort here,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.640
and those initially start
out here at top level.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.920
The first step is
divide them in half.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.440
All right?

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.702
I'm not sure how
to mark it here,

00:10:29.702 --> 00:10:31.160
remember I need to
come back there.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.189
I'm not yet done.

00:10:33.189 --> 00:10:33.730
What do I do?

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:40.805
Divide them in half again.

00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:42.430
You know, if I had
like shells and peas

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.229
here I could make
some more money.

00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:44.770
What do I do?

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:50.980
I divide them in
half one more time.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.450
Let me cluster them
because really what I have,

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:56.240
sorry, separate them out.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.980
I've gone from one
problem size eight down

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.170
to eight problems of size one.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.540
At this stage I'm at
my singleton case.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.229
So this is easy.

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:04.770
What do I do?

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.950
I merge.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:17.180
And the merge is,
put them in order.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.030
What do I do next?

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.510
Obvious thing, I merge these.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.800
And that as we saw was
a nice linear operation.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:30.900
It's fun to do it upside
down, and then one more merge

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.040
which is I take the smallest
elements of each one

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:40.350
until I get to where I want.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.760
Wow aren't you impressed.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.610
No, don't please don't
clap, not for that one.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.622
Now let me do it a second
time to show you that --

00:11:48.622 --> 00:11:49.580
I'm saying this poorly.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.790
Let me say it again.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.327
That's the general idea.

00:11:52.327 --> 00:11:53.660
What should you see out of that?

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.280
I just kept sub-dividing
down until I

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.210
got really easy problems,
and then I combine them back.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.380
I actually misled you
slightly there or maybe a lot,

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.760
because I did it in parallel.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.180
In fact, let me just shuffle
these up a little bit.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.180
Really what's going to
happen here, because this

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.650
is a sequential
computer, is that we're

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.940
going to start off up
here, at top level,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:19.530
we're going to divide
into half, then

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.490
we're going to do the
complete subdivision

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.160
and merge here before we ever
come back and do this one.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.030
We're going to do a division
here and then a division there.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.850
At that stage we can merge
these, and then take this down,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.150
do the division merge
and bring them back up.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:41.880
Let me show you an
example by running that.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.300
I've got a little list
I've made here called test.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:53.360
Let's run merge sort on it, and
then we'll look at the code.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.170
OK, what I would like you to
see is I've been printing out,

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.420
as I went along, actually
let's back up slightly

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.950
and look at the code.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.440
There's merge sort.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.140
Takes in a list.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.098
What does it say to do?

00:13:05.098 --> 00:13:07.880
It says check to see if
I'm in that base case.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.050
It's the list of
length less than two.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.740
Is it one basically?

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.090
In which case, just
return a copy the list.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.279
That's the simple case.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.820
Otherwise, notice
what it says to do.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:24.640
It's says find the mid-point
and split the list in half.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.070
Copy of the back end, sorry,
copy of the left side,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.380
copy of the right side.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.690
Run merge sort on those.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.430
By induction, if it
does the right thing,

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.740
I'm going to get back
two lists, and I'm

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.814
going to then merge
them together.

00:13:36.814 --> 00:13:37.980
Notice what I'm going to do.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.370
I'm going to print here
the list if we go into it,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.310
and print of the when we're
done and then just return that.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.160
Merge up here.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.190
There's a little
more code there.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.565
I'll let you just
grok it but you

00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:51.200
can see it's basically
doing what I did over there.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.230
Setting up two indices
for the two sub-list,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.460
it's just walking down,
finding the smallest element,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.890
putting it into a new list.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.700
When it gets to the end
of one of the lists,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.339
it skips to the next part, and
only one of these two pieces

00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:05.005
will get called because
only one of them

00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:06.421
is going to have
things leftovers.

00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:08.502
It's going to add
the other pieces in.

00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:09.960
OK, if you look at
that then, let's

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.585
look at what happened
when we ran this.

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:16.480
We started off with a
call with that list.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.030
Ah ha, split it in half.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.190
It's going down the
left side of this.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.700
That got split in half,
and that got split in half

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.180
until I got to a list of one.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.620
Here's the first
list of size one.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.120
There's the second
list of size one.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.600
So I merged them.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.560
It's now in the right order, and
that's coming from right there.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.320
Having done that,
it goes back up

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.210
and picks the second sub-list,
which came from there.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.150
It's a down to base
case, merges it.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.770
When these two merges
are done, we're

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.690
basically at a
stage in that branch

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.730
where we can now merge those two
together, which gives us that,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.330
and it goes through
the rest of it.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:00.000
A really nice algorithm.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.210
As I said, an example
of divide and conquer.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.600
Notice here that it's different
than the binary search case.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.240
We're certainly dividing
down, but the combination now

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.370
actually takes some work.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.082
I'll have to actually figure out
how to put them back together.

00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:16.540
And that's a general
thing you want

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.040
to keep in mind
when you're thinking

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.159
about designing a divide and
conquer kind of algorithm.

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:23.450
You really want to get the
power of dividing things up,

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.645
but if you end up doing a ton of
work at the combination stage,

00:15:26.645 --> 00:15:28.020
you may not have
gained anything.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.290
So you really want to
think about that trade off.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:37.682
All right, having said that,
what's the complexity here?

00:15:37.682 --> 00:15:40.140
Boy, there's a dumb question,
because I've been telling you

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.540
for the last two lectures
the complexity is n log n,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.790
but let's see if it really is.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.440
What's the complexity here?

00:15:46.440 --> 00:16:01.727
If we think about it, we start
off with the problem of size n.

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:02.310
What do we do?

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.530
We split it into two
problems of size n over 2.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.340
Those get split each into two
problems of size n over 4,

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:14.790
and we keep doing that
until we get down to a level

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:20.270
in this tree where we have
only singletons left over.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.480
Once we're there, we
have to do the merge.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.980
Notice what happens here.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:30.420
We said each of the merge
operations was of order n.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.430
But n is different.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.630
Right?

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.450
Down here, I've just
got two things to merge,

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.950
and then I've got
things of size two

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.530
to merge and then things
of size four to merge.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.690
But notice a trade off.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.960
I have n operations if you
like down there of size one.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.140
Up here I have n over two
operations of size two.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.680
Up here I've got n over four
operations of size four.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.950
So I always have to do
a merge of n elements.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.480
How much time does that take?

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.210
Well, we said it, right?

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.950
Where did I put it?

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.900
Right there, order n.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:16.402
So I have order n operations
at each level in the tree.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:17.860
And then how many
levels deep am I?

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.900
Well, that's the divide, right?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:26.480
So how many levels do I have?

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.100
Log n, because at each stage
I'm cutting the problem in half.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.570
So I start off
with n then it's n

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.460
over two n over
four n over eight.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:40.806
So I have n operations log n
times, there we go, n log n.

00:17:40.806 --> 00:17:42.180
Took us a long
time to get there,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.340
but it's a nice
algorithm to have.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:51.670
Let me generalize this slightly.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.150
When we get a problem,
a standard tool

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.900
to try and attack
it with is to say,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.800
is there some way to break
this problem down into simpler,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.820
I shouldn't say simpler, smaller
versions of the same problem.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.512
If I can do that,
it's a good candidate

00:18:07.512 --> 00:18:08.470
for divide and conquer.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.928
And then the things I have to
ask is how much of a division

00:18:10.928 --> 00:18:12.210
do I want to do?

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.950
The obvious one is
to divide it in half,

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.366
but there may be cases where
there are different divisions

00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:18.270
you want to have take place.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.632
The second question I want to
ask is what's the base case?

00:18:21.632 --> 00:18:23.215
When do I get down
to a problem that's

00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:26.740
small enough that it's
basically trivial to solve?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.460
Here it was lists of size one.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.557
I could have stopped at
lists of size two right.

00:18:30.557 --> 00:18:31.640
That's an easy comparison.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.850
Do one comparison and return one
of two possible orders on it,

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.410
but I need to decide that.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.930
And the third thing I need to
decide is how do I combine?

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.260
You know, point out to you
in the binary search case,

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.037
combination was trivial.

00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:46.120
The answer to the final
search was just the answer

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.270
all the way up.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.157
Here, a little more
work, and that's

00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:50.490
why I'll come back to that idea.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.081
If I'm basically
just squeezing jello,

00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:55.080
that is, I'm trying to
make the problem simpler,

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.500
but the combination turns
out to be really complex,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.050
I've not gained anything.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.100
So things that are good
candidates for divide

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.280
and conquer are
problems where it's

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.400
easy to figure out
how to divide down,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.880
and the combination is
of little complexity.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.792
It would be nice if it
was less than linear,

00:19:11.792 --> 00:19:13.250
but linear is nice
because then I'm

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.950
going to get that n log
in kind of behavior.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.880
And if you ask the TAs
in recitation tomorrow,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.517
they'll tell you that you see
a lot of n log n algorithms

00:19:20.517 --> 00:19:21.350
in computer science.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.220
It's a very common
class of algorithms,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.210
and it's very
useful one to have.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.500
Now, one of the questions
we could still ask

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.660
is, right, we've got
binary search, which

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.880
has got this nice log behavior.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.130
If we can sort things, you know,
we get this n log n behavior,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.490
and we got a n log
n behavior overall.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.412
But can we actually do
better in terms of searching.

00:19:47.412 --> 00:19:49.120
I'm going to show you
one last technique.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.470
And in fact, we're going to put
quotes around the word better,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.580
but it does better than even
this kind of binary search,

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:04.090
and that's a method
called hashing.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:08.402
You've actually seen hashing,
you just don't know it.

00:20:08.402 --> 00:20:09.860
Hashing is the the
technique that's

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.720
used in Python to
represent dictionaries.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.840
Hashing is used
when you actually

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.460
come in to Logan Airport
and Immigration or Homeland

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.060
Security checks your
picture against a database.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.880
Hashing is used every time you
enter a password into a system.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.320
So what in the world is hashing?

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.180
Well, let me start with
a simple little example.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:35.850
Suppose I want to represent
a collection of integers.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.690
This is an easy little example.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.080
And I promise you that
the integers are never

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.580
going to be anything other
than between the range of zero

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:45.607
to nine.

00:20:45.607 --> 00:20:47.690
OK, so it might be the
collection of one and five.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:48.670
It might be two,
three, four, eight.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.128
I mean some collection
of integers,

00:20:50.128 --> 00:20:52.980
but I guarantee you it's
between zero and nine.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.690
Here's the trick I can play.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:11.840
I can build -- I can't count --
I could build a list with spots

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.390
for all of those elements, zero,
one, two, three, four, five,

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.040
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.750
And then when I want
to create my set,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:24.230
I could simply put
a one everywhere

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.090
that that integer falls.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:27.940
So if I wanted to
represent, for example,

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.360
this is the set
two, six and eight,

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.279
I put a one in those slots.

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:37.570
This seems a little weird,
but bear with me for second,

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.940
in fact, I've given you a
little piece a code to do it,

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:45.890
which is the next piece
of code on the hand out.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.960
So let's take a look
at it for second.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.140
This little set of code here
from create insert and number.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:53.897
What's create do?

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.480
It says, given a low
and a high range,

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.230
in this case it would
be zero to nine.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.197
I'm going to build a list.

00:22:00.197 --> 00:22:02.530
Right, you can see that little
loop going through there.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:03.220
What am I doing?

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.079
I'm creating a list with just
that special symbol none in it.

00:22:07.079 --> 00:22:08.120
So I'm building the list.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.972
I'm returning that as my set.

00:22:09.972 --> 00:22:11.430
And then to create
the object, I'll

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.050
simply do a set of inserts.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.130
If I want the values two,
six and eight in there,

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:18.520
I would do an insert of two
into that set, an insert of six

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.827
into that set, and an insert
of eight into the set.

00:22:20.827 --> 00:22:21.660
And what does it do?

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.945
It marks a one in
each of those spots.

00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:26.070
Now, what did I want to do?

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.650
I wanted to check membership.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:28.840
I want to do search.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.430
Well that's simple.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.390
Given that representation
and some value,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.300
I just say gee is it there?

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:43.500
What's the order
complexity here?

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.310
I know I drive you
nuts asking questions?

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.530
What's the order
complexity here?

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:57.870
Quadratic, linear,
log, constant?

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.500
Any takers?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.124
I know I have the wrong glasses
on the see hands up too, but...

00:23:01.124 --> 00:23:04.320
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.350
PROFESSOR: Who said it?

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:06.290
STUDENT: Constant.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.559
PROFESSOR: Constant, why?

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:09.600
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.683
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you.

00:23:10.683 --> 00:23:11.890
All right, it is constant.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.280
You keep sitting back there
where I can't get to you.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.690
Thank you very much.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.480
It has a constant.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.250
Remember we said
we design lists so

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.850
that the access, no matter
where it was on the list

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.910
was of constant time.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.810
That is another way of saying
that looking up this thing here

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:29.960
is constant.

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.009
So this is constant
time, order one.

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:37.050
Come on, you know,
representing sets of integers,

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.520
this is pretty dumb.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.557
Suppose I want to have
a set of characters.

00:23:41.557 --> 00:23:42.390
How could I do that?

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.320
Well the idea of
a hash, in fact,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.880
what's called a hash function
is to have some way of mapping

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.060
any kind of data into integers.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.260
So let's look at the second
example, all right, --

00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:01.700
I keep doing that -- this piece
of code from here to here gives

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.860
me a way of now creating
a hash table of size 256.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.252
Ord as a built in
python representation.

00:24:09.252 --> 00:24:11.460
There is lots of them around
that takes any character

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.600
and gives you back an integer.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.760
In fact, just to show that
to you, if I go down here

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:32.250
and I type ord, sorry,
I did that wrong.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.660
Let me try again.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:38.889
We'll get to
exceptions in a second.

00:24:38.889 --> 00:24:39.930
I give it some character.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.706
It gives me back an
integer representing.

00:24:42.706 --> 00:24:43.330
It looks weird.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.870
Why is three come back
to some other thing?

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.360
That's the internal
representation

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.610
that python uses for this.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:51.080
If I give it some
other character, yeah,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.230
it would help if I could type,
give it some other character.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.460
It gives me back
a representation.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.430
So now here's the idea.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.280
I build a list
256 elements long,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.240
and I fill it up with those
special characters none.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.880
That's what create is
going to do right here.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.130
And then hash character takes
in any string or character,

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.270
single character,
gives me back a number.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.170
Notice what I do.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.220
If I want to create
a set or a sequence

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.430
representing these things, I
simply insert into that list.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.990
It goes through and puts
ones in the right place.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.587
And then, if I want to find
out if something's there,

00:25:29.587 --> 00:25:30.420
I do the same thing.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.890
But notice now, hash
is converting the input

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.060
into an integer.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.130
So, what's the idea?

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.470
If I know what my
hash function does,

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:46.850
it maps, in this case
characters into a range zero

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.720
to 256, which is zero to 255,
I create a list that long,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.350
and I simply mark things.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.164
And my look up is
still constant.

00:25:55.164 --> 00:25:56.080
Characters are simple.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.790
Suppose you want to
represent sets of strings,

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.379
well you basically just
generalize the hash function.

00:26:01.379 --> 00:26:03.170
I think one of the
classic ones for strings

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.080
is called the
Rabin-Karp algorithm.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.870
And it's simply the
same idea that you

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:13.810
have a mapping from your
import into a set of integers.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.880
Wow, OK, maybe not so wow,
but this is now constant.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.920
This is constant time access.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.000
So I can do searching in
constant time which is great.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.070
Where's the penalty?

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.970
What did I trade off here?

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.950
Well I'm going to
suggest that what I did

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:40.080
was I really traded
space for time.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.240
It makes me sound like an
astro physicist somehow right?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.860
What do I mean by that?

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.000
I have constant time
access which is great,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.660
but I paid a price, which is
I had to use up some space.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.290
In the case of
integers it was easy.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.060
In the case of characters, so I
have to give up a list of 256,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.390
no big deal.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.450
Imagine now you
want to do faces.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.190
You've got a picture
of somebody's face,

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.300
it's a million pixels.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:07.410
Each pixel has a range of
values from zero to 256.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.477
I want to hash a face with
some function into an integer.

00:27:11.477 --> 00:27:13.310
I may not want to do
the full range of this,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.550
but I may decide I have to use
a lot of gigabytes of space

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.199
in order to do a trade off.

00:27:18.199 --> 00:27:19.740
The reason I'm
showing you this is it

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.880
that this is a gain, a common
trade off in computer science.

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.015
That in many cases,
I can gain efficiency

00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:28.220
if I'm willing to give up space.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.470
Having said that though,
there may still be a problem,

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.719
or there ought to be a problem
that may be bugging you

00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:36.320
slightly, which is
how do I guarantee

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.660
that my hash function takes
any input into exactly one

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.600
spot in the storage space?

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.190
The answer is I can't.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.680
OK, in the simple
case of integers

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.480
I can, but in the case
of something more complex

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.790
like faces or fingerprints
or passwords for that matter,

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.850
it's hard to design
a hash function that

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.970
has completely even
distribution, meaning

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.950
that it takes any input into
exactly one output spot.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.560
So what you typically do
and a hash case is you

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.300
design your code
to deal with that.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.230
You try to design -- actually
I'm going to come back to that

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.290
in a second.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.820
It's like you're trying to use
a hash function that spread

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.060
things out pretty evenly.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.280
But the places you store
into in those lists

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.082
may have to themselves
have a small list in there,

00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:17.540
and when you go to
check something,

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.831
you may have to do a linear
search through the elements

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:20.930
in that list.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.050
The good news is the
elements in any one spot

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.090
in a hash table are likely to
be a small number, three, four,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.670
five.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:27.790
So the search is really easy.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.280
You're not searching
a million things.

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.863
You're searching
three or four things,

00:28:30.863 --> 00:28:34.090
but nonetheless, you have
to do that trade off.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.250
The last thing I want
to say about hashes

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:46.057
are that they're actually
really hard to create.

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:48.390
There's been a lot of work
done on these over the years,

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.720
but in fact, it's pretty hard
to invent a good hash function.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.305
So my advice to
you is, if you want

00:28:53.305 --> 00:28:56.340
to use something was a
hash, go to a library.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.580
Look up a good hash function.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.244
For strings, there's
a classic set of them

00:29:00.244 --> 00:29:01.160
that work pretty well.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.930
For integers, there are
some real simple ones.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.470
If there's something
more complex,

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.000
find a good hash function, but
designing a really good hash

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.070
function takes a lot of
effort because you want it

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.610
to have that even distribution.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.290
You'd like it to have
as few duplicates

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.730
if you like in each spot in
the hash table for each one

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.800
of the things that you use.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.760
Let me pull back
for a second then.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.640
What have we done over the
last three or four lectures?

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.790
We've started introducing
you to classes of algorithms.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.100
Things that I'd like
you to be able to see

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.310
are how to do some simple
complexity analysis.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.670
Perhaps more importantly, how
to recognize a kind of algorithm

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.940
based on its properties and
know what class it belongs to.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.640
This is a hint.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.560
If you like, leaning
towards the next quiz,

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.714
that you oughta be
able to say that

00:29:48.714 --> 00:29:50.130
looks like a
logarithmic algorithm

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.780
because it's got a
particular property.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.280
That looks like an
n log n algorithm

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.821
because it has a
particular property.

00:29:54.821 --> 00:29:56.740
And the third
thing we've done is

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.190
we've given you now a set of
sort of standard algorithms

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.710
if you like.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.270
Brute force, just walk
through every possible case.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.080
It works well if the
problem sizes are small.

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.090
We've had, there are a number
of variants of guess and check

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.540
or hypothesize and test, where
you try to guess the solution

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.270
and then check it and use
that to refine your search.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.925
Successive approximation,
Newton-Raphson

00:30:19.925 --> 00:30:21.300
was one nice
example, but there's

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.200
a whole class of things that
get closer and closer, reducing

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.550
your errors as you go along.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.807
Divide and conquer
and actually I

00:30:29.807 --> 00:30:31.890
guess in between there
bi-section, which is really

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:34.820
just a very difficult of
successive approximation,

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.140
but divide and conquer
is a class of algorithm.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.620
These are tools that you
want in your tool box.

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.370
These are the kinds
of algorithms that you

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.810
should be able to recognize.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.990
And what I'd like you to begin
to do is to look at a problem

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.690
and say, gee, which
kind of algorithm

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.600
is most likely to be
successful on this problem,

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:54.340
and map it into that case.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:56.810
OK, starting next -- don't
worry I'm not going to quit 36

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.810
minutes after -- I got
one more topic for today.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.780
But jumping ahead, I'm
going to skip in a second

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.880
now to talk about one last
linguistic thing from Python,

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.410
but I want to preface Professor
Guttag is going to pick up

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.951
next week, and what we're going
to start doing then is taking

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.960
these classes of algorithms
and start looking at much more

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:13.870
complex algorithms.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:16.200
Things you're more likely
to use in problems.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.780
Things like knapsack
problems as we move ahead.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.780
But the tools you've
seen so far are really

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:23.155
the things that
were going to see

00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:24.860
as we build those algorithms.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.920
OK, I want to spend
the last portion

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.420
of this lecture doing one last
piece of linguistics stuff.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.640
One last little thing
from Python, and that's

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:44.760
to talk about exceptions.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.597
OK, you've actually
seen exceptions a lot,

00:31:48.597 --> 00:31:51.180
you just didn't know that's what
they were, because exceptions

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.689
show up everywhere in Python.

00:31:52.689 --> 00:31:54.230
Let me give you a
couple of examples.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.480
I'm going to clear
some space here.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.840
Before I type in
that expression,

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.417
I get an error, right?

00:32:02.417 --> 00:32:03.250
So it's not defined.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.190
But in fact, what this did
was it threw an exception.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.840
An exception is called
a name error exception.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.820
It says you gave me something
I didn't know how to deal.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.460
I'm going to throw
it, or raise it,

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.910
to use the right
term to somebody

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.410
in case they can
handle it, but it's

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.430
a particular kind of exception.

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:24.500
I might do something like,
remind you I have test.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:31.834
If I do this, try and get the
10th element of a list that's

00:32:31.834 --> 00:32:32.500
only eight long.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.210
I get what looks like an
error, but it's actually

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.130
throwing an exception.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.080
The exception is right there.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.730
It's an index
error, that is it's

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.720
trying to do something going
beyond the range of what

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.055
this thing could deal with.

00:32:45.055 --> 00:32:47.180
OK, you say, come on, I've
seen these all the time.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.013
Every time I type
something into my program,

00:32:49.013 --> 00:32:50.830
it does one of
these things, right?

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.450
When we're just interacting
with idol, with the interactive

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.150
editor or sorry, interactive
environment if you like,

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.589
that's what you expect.

00:32:58.589 --> 00:33:00.130
What's happening is
that we're typing

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.200
in something, an expression
it doesn't know how to deal.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.116
It's raising the exception,
but is this simply

00:33:04.116 --> 00:33:07.600
bubbling up at the top level
saying you've got a problem.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:11.210
Suppose instead
you're in the middle

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.830
of some deep piece of code and
you get one of these cases.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.660
It's kind of annoying if
it throws it all the way

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.450
back up to top level
for you to fix.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.880
If it's truly a bug, that's
the right thing to do.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.095
You want to catch it.

00:33:25.095 --> 00:33:27.690
But in many cases exceptions
or things that, in fact,

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.280
you as a program designer
could have handled.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.870
So I'm going to
distinguish in fact

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.160
between un-handled
exceptions, which

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:43.442
are the things that we saw
there, and handled exceptions.

00:33:43.442 --> 00:33:45.650
I'm going to show you in a
second how to handle them,

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:46.858
but let's look at an example.

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.200
What do I mean by a
handled exception?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.230
Well let's look at the
next piece of code.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.210
OK, it's right here.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:56.700
It's called read float.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.109
We'll look at it in a second.

00:33:58.109 --> 00:33:59.900
Let me sort of set the
stage up for this --

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.210
suppose I want to input --
I'm sorry I want you as a user

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.850
to input a floating
point number.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.070
We talked about
things you could do

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.320
to try make sure that happens.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.778
You could run
through a little loop

00:34:10.778 --> 00:34:12.370
to say keep trying
until you get one.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.650
But one of the ways I could deal
with it is what's shown here.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.830
And what's this
little loop say to do?

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.580
This little loop says
I'm going to write

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.484
a function or procedures
that takes in two messages.

00:34:23.484 --> 00:34:25.150
I'm going to run
through a loop, and I'm

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:26.983
going to request some
input, which I'm going

00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:28.150
to read in with raw input.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.040
I'm going to store
that into val.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.880
And as you might
expect, I'm going

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.522
to then try and see if I can
convert that into a float.

00:34:35.522 --> 00:34:37.730
Oh wait a minute, that's a
little different than what

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:38.730
we did last time, right?

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.682
Last time we checked
the type and said

00:34:40.682 --> 00:34:41.890
if it is a float you're okay.

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:42.680
If not, carry on.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.971
In this case what would happen?

00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:46.800
Well float is going to
try and do the cohersion.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.540
It's going to try and turn it
into a floating point number.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:52.990
If it does, I'm great, right.

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.100
And I like just to return val.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.700
If it doesn't, floats
going to throw or raise,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.330
to use the right
term, an exception.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.040
It's going to say something
like a type error.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.650
In fact, let's try it over here.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:09.177
I if I go over here, and
I say float of three,

00:35:09.177 --> 00:35:10.510
it's going to do the conversion.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:14.830
But if I say turn
this into a float,

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.790
ah it throws a value
error exception.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.610
It says it's a wrong kind
of value that I've got.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.880
So I'm going to write a
little piece of code that

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.950
says if it gives me a
float, I'm set, But if not,

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:29.130
I'd like to have the code
handle the exception.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.470
And that's what this funky
try/except thing does.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:43.570
This is a try/except block
and here's the flow of control

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.170
that takes place in there.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.217
When I hit a try-block.

00:35:47.217 --> 00:35:48.550
It's going to literally do that.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.090
It's going to try and
execute the instructions.

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.310
If it can successfully
execute the instructions,

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.870
it's going to skip
past the except block

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.720
and just carry on with
the rest of the code.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.920
If, however, it raises an
exception, that exception,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.940
at least in this case where
it's a pure accept with no tags

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.140
on it, is going to get,
be like thrown directly

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.927
to the except block, and it's
going to try and execute that.

00:36:12.927 --> 00:36:14.760
So notice what's going
to happen here, then.

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.960
If I give it something that
can be turned into a float,

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.380
I come in here,
I read the input,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.000
if it can be turned
into a float,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.600
I'm going to just return
the value and I'm set.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.070
If not, it's basically
going to throw it

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.570
to this point, in which case
I'm going to print out an error

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.240
message and oh yeah, I'm
still in that while loop,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.960
so it's going to go around.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.320
So in fact, if I
go here and, let me

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.490
un-comment this
and run the code.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:41.950
It says enter a float.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:48.940
And if I give it something that
can be -- sorry, I've got, yes,

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.480
never mind the grades crap.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.190
Where did I have that?

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.014
Let me comment that out.

00:36:58.014 --> 00:37:00.180
Somehow it's appropriate
in the middle of my lecture

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.650
for it to say whoops at me but
that wasn't what I intended.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:08.959
And we will try this again.

00:37:08.959 --> 00:37:10.250
OK, says it says enter a float.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.541
I give it something that can
be converted into a float,

00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:13.485
it says fine.

00:37:13.485 --> 00:37:15.360
I'm going to go back
and run it again though.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:21.290
If I run it again, it
says enter a float.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:24.750
Ah ha, it goes into that accept
portion, prints out a message,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.026
and goes back around the
while loop to say try again.

00:37:27.026 --> 00:37:28.400
And it's going to
keep doing this

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.360
until I give it something
that does serve as a float.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.810
Right, so an exception
then has this format

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.172
that I can control
as a programmer.

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.380
Why would I want to use this?

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.070
Well some things I can
actually expect may happen

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.424
and I want to handle them.

00:37:45.424 --> 00:37:46.840
The float example
is a simple one.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.780
I'm going to
generalize in a second.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.910
Here's a better example.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:52.135
I'm writing a piece of code
that wants to input a file.

00:37:52.135 --> 00:37:53.510
I can certainly
imagine something

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:54.740
that says give me
the file name, I'm

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.010
going to do something with it.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.270
I can't guarantee that the
file may exist under that name,

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.530
but I know that's
something that might occur.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.415
So a nice way to handle
it is to write it

00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:04.810
as an exception
that says, here's

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.480
what I want to do
if I get the file.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.476
But just in case the
file name is not there,

00:38:09.476 --> 00:38:11.600
here's what I want to do
in that case to handle it.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.275
Let me specify what the
exception should do.

00:38:15.275 --> 00:38:16.650
In the example I
just wrote here,

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:17.900
this is pretty trivial, right.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:19.590
OK, I'm trying to input floats.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.650
I could generalize
this pretty nicely.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.210
Imagine the same
kind of idea where

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.576
I want to simply say I want
to take input of anything

00:38:25.576 --> 00:38:28.200
and try and see how to make sure
I get the right kind of thing.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:35.240
I want to make it polymorphic.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.250
Well that's pretty easy to do.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:43.410
That is basically the
next example, right here.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:49.110
In fact, let me
comment this one out.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.880
I can do exactly the
same kind of thing.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.270
Now what I'm going to try and
do is read in a set of values,

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:59.190
but I'm going to give a type of
value as well as the messages.

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.220
The format is the same.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.290
I'm going to ask for
some input, and then I

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.840
am going to use that
procedure to check,

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.810
is this the right type of value.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:10.260
And I'm trying to use that to
do the coercion if you like.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.880
Same thing if it works, I'm
going to skip that, if it not,

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.296
it's going to throw
the exception.

00:39:14.296 --> 00:39:16.300
Why is this much nice?

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.119
Well, that's a
handy piece of code.

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:19.535
Because imagine
I've got that now,

00:39:19.535 --> 00:39:23.960
and I can now store that away in
some file name, input dot p y,

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.150
and import into every one
of my procedure functions,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.240
pardon me, my files
of procedures,

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.160
because it's a standard way
of now giving me the input.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.060
OK, so far though, I've
just shown you what

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.680
happens inside a peace a code.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.740
It raises an exception.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.470
It goes to that accept clause.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:42.140
We don't have to use it
just inside of one place.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.430
We can actually use
it more generally.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.480
And that gets me to the last
example I wanted to show you.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:55.519
Let me uncomment this.

00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:56.810
Let's take a look at this code.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:00.010
This looks like a
handy piece of code

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.740
to have given what we
just recently did to you.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.810
All right, get grades.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:06.230
It's a little function that's
going to say give me a file

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:09.570
name, and I'm going to
go off and open that up

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.870
and bind it to a local variable.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.744
And if it's successful,
then I'd just

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:16.160
like to go off and do some
things like turn it into a list

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.770
so I can compute average score
or distributions or something

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.270
else.

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.700
I don't really care
what's going on here.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.190
Notice though what I've done.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.300
Open, it doesn't
succeed is going

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:31.705
to raise a particular kind of
exception called I O error.

00:40:31.705 --> 00:40:33.830
And so I've done a little
bit different things here

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:39.519
which is I put the accept part
of the block with I O error.

00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:40.310
What does that say?

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.840
It says if in the code up here
I get an exception of that sort,

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:46.920
I'm going to go to this
place to handle it.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.960
On the other hand, if
I'm inside this procedure

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.360
and some other
exception is raised,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.200
it's not tagged
by that one, it's

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.316
going to raise it up the chain.

00:40:55.316 --> 00:40:57.690
If that procedure was called
by some other procedure it's

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.040
going to say is there an
exception block in there

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.936
that can handle that.

00:41:00.936 --> 00:41:02.810
If not, I am going to
keep going up the chain

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.929
until eventually I
get to the top level.

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.220
And you can see that down here.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.320
I'm going to run
this in a second.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.736
This is just a
piece of code where

00:41:08.736 --> 00:41:10.700
I'm going to say, gee,
if I can get the grades,

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.020
do something, if not carry on.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:19.287
And if I go ahead and run this
-- now it's going to say woops,

00:41:19.287 --> 00:41:19.786
at me.

00:41:19.786 --> 00:41:25.760
What happened?

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.170
I'm down here and
try, I'm trying

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.120
do get grades, which is a call
to that function, which is not

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.932
bound in my computer.

00:41:33.932 --> 00:41:34.890
That says it's in here.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:36.450
It's in this try-block.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:41.350
It raised an exception, but
it wasn't and I O error.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.490
So it passes it back, past this
exception, up to this level,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.910
which gets to that exception.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.210
Let me say this a
little bit better then.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.240
I can write exceptions
inside a piece of code.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.570
Try this, if it
doesn't work I can

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.240
have an exception that catches
any error at that level.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.360
Or I can say catch only these
kinds of errors at that level,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.190
otherwise pass
them up the chain.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.250
And that exception will
keep getting passed up

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.680
the chain of calls
until it either

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.180
gets to the top
level, in which case

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.830
it looks like what
you see all the time.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:14.330
It looks like an error, but it
tells you what the error came

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.080
from, or it gets an exception
, it can deal with it.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.580
OK, so the last thing
to say about this

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:37.940
is what's the difference between
an exception and an assert?

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.660
We introduced
asserts earlier on.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.350
You've actually seen them
in some pieces of code,

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:47.150
so what's the difference
between the two of them?

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.920
Well here's my way
of describing it.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.090
The goal of an assert,
or an assert statement,

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.600
is basically to say,
look, you can make sure

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.150
that my function is going
to give this kind of result

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.380
if you give me inputs
of a particular type.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.630
Sorry, wrong way of saying it.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:05.220
If you give me
inputs that satisfy

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.302
some particular constraints.

00:43:07.302 --> 00:43:08.760
That was the kind
of thing you saw.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.260
Asserts said here are
some conditions to test.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:13.770
If they're true, I'm going to
let the rest of the code run.

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.840
If not, I'm going
to throw an error.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.590
So the assertion
is basically saying

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:24.750
we got some
pre-conditions, those

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.100
are the clauses inside the
assert that have to be true,

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:34.120
and there's a post
condition. and in essence,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.780
what the assert is saying is, or
rather the programmer is saying

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.370
using the assert is, if you
give me input that satisfies

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:41.995
the preconditions,
I'm guaranteeing

00:43:41.995 --> 00:43:43.780
to you that my code is
going to give you something

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.050
that meets the post condition.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:46.737
It's going to do
the right thing.

00:43:46.737 --> 00:43:48.820
And as a consequence, as
you saw with the asserts,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.560
if the preconditions aren't
true, it throws an error.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.480
It goes back up the top
level saying stop operation

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.100
immediately and goes
back up the top level.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.774
Asserts in fact are
nice in the sense

00:44:00.774 --> 00:44:02.190
that they let you
check conditions

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.730
at debugging time
or testing time.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:07.610
So you can actually use them to
see where your code is going.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.070
An exception, when you use
an exception, basically what

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.030
you're saying is, look,
you can do anything

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.447
you want with my
function, and you

00:44:13.447 --> 00:44:15.030
can be sure that I'm
going to tell you

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:16.340
if something is going wrong.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.840
And in many cases I'm
going to handle it myself.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.300
So as much as possible,
the exceptions

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.296
are going to try to
handle unexpected things,

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:27.920
actually wrong term,
you expected them,

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.210
but not what the user did.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.940
It's going to try
to handle conditions

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.760
other than the
normal ones itself.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.790
So you can use the
thing in anyway.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.290
If it can't, it's going to try
and throw it to somebody else

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:41.190
to handle, and only
if there is no handler

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:45.270
for that unexpected condition,
will it come up to top level.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.400
So, summarizing
better, assert is

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.360
something you put in
to say to the user,

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.790
make sure you're giving
me input of this type,

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.164
but I'm going to guarantee
you the rest of the code works

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:54.810
correctly.

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.880
Exceptions and exception
handlers are saying,

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:59.400
here are the odd
cases that I might see

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.650
and here's what I'd like
to do in those cases

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.950
in order to try and be
able to deal with them.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:10.970
Last thing to say is why would
you want to have exceptions?

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.140
Well, let's go back to
that case of inputting

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.570
a simple little floating point.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:18.270
If I'm expecting
mostly numbers in,

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.936
I can certainly try
and do the coercion.

00:45:19.936 --> 00:45:22.910
I could have done that
just doing the coercion.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:25.990
The problem is, I want
to know if, in fact, I've

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.020
got something that's not
of the form I expect.

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.490
I'm much better having
an exception get handled

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.525
at the time of input
than to let that prop --

00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:35.900
that value rather propagate
through a whole bunch of code

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.960
until eventually it hits
an error 17 calls later,

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.460
and you have no clue
where it came from.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.190
So the exceptions
are useful when

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:45.420
you want to have
the ability to say,

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.032
I expect in general
this kind of behavior,

00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:50.490
but I do know there are some
other things that might happen

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:53.510
and here's what I'd like to
do in each one of those cases.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:56.100
But I do want to make sure that
I don't let a value that I'm

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.700
not expecting pass through.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.480
That goes back to that idea
of sort of discipline coding.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.530
It's easy to have
assumptions about what

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.730
you think are going to come into
the program when you writ it.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.250
If you really know what
they are use them as search,

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.500
but if you think there's
going to be some flexibility,

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.540
you want to prevent the user
getting trapped in a bad spot,

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.860
and exceptions as a consequence
are a good thing to use.
