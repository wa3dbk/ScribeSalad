00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.460
PROFESSOR: I want to pick
up exactly where I

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.260
left off last time.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.080
When I was talking about various
sins one can commit

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.140
with statistics.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:45.400
And I had been talking about the
sin of data enhancement,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.280
where the basic idea there is,
you take a piece of data, and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.820
you read much more into
it than it implies.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.810
In particular, a very common
thing people do with data is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.900
they extrapolate.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:08.080
I'd given you a couple
of examples.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:17.270
In the real world, it's often
not desirable to say that I

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.770
have a point here, and a point
here, therefore the next point

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.840
will surely be here.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.400
And we can just extrapolate
in a straight line.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.560
We before saw some examples
where I had an algorithm to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.410
generate points, and we fit a
curve to it, used the curve to

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.190
predict future points,
and discovered

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.720
it was nowhere close.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.650
Unfortunately, we often see
people do this sort of thing.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.950
One of my favorite stories is,
William Ruckelshaus, who was

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.140
head of the Environmental
Protection Agency

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.740
in the early 1970s.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.840
And he had a press conference,
spoke about the increased use

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.360
of cars, and the decreased
amount of carpooling.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.970
He was trying to get people to
carpool, since at the time

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.980
carpooling was on the way down,
and I now quote, "each

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.760
car entering the central city,
sorry, in 1960," he said,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.630
"each car entering the central
city had 1.7 people in it.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.540
By 1970. this had dropped
to less than 1.2.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.660
If present trends continue, by
1980, more than 1 out of every

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.890
10 cars entering the city will
have no driver." Amazingly

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.990
enough, the press reported this
as a straight story, and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.130
talked about how we would be
dramatically dropping.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.640
Of course, as it happened,
it didn't occur.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.470
But it's just an example of, how
much trouble you can get

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.880
into by extrapolating.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.870
The final sin I want to talk
about is probably the most

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:13.830
common, and it's called the
Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.626
Now before I get into
that, are any of

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:17.390
you here from Texas?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.670
All right, you're going
to be offended.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.870
Let me think, OK, anybody
here from Oklahoma?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.380
You'll like it.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.610
I'll dump on Oklahoma, it will
be much better then.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.530
We'll talk about the Oklahoma
sharpshooter fallacy.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.780
We won't talk about the
BCS rankings, though.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800
So the idea here is a
pretty simple one.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.020
This is a famous marksman who
fires his gun randomly at the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.470
side of a barn, has a bunch of
holes in it, then goes and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.480
takes a can of paint and draws
bullseyes around all the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.550
places his bullets
happened to hit.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.770
And people walk by the barn
and say, God, he is good.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.750
So obviously, not a good thing,
but amazingly easy to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.400
fall into this trap.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.790
So here's another example.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.840
In August of 2001, a paper which
people took seriously

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.950
appeared in a moderately serious
journal called The New

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:33.050
Scientist. And it announced that
researchers in Scotland

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
had proven that anorexics
are likely to have

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.830
been born in June.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.080
I'm sure you all knew that.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.750
How did how did they
prove this?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.570
Or demonstrate this?

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:59.950
They studied 446 women.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.790
Each of whom had been
diagnosed anorexic.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:21.520
And they observed that about 30
percent more than average

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:33.620
were born in June.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.950
Now, since the monthly average
of births, if you divide this

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.200
by 12, it's about 37, that
tells us that 48

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.210
were born in June.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.360
So at first sight, this seems
significant, and in fact if

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.370
you run tests, and ask what's
the likelihood of that many

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.270
more being born in 1
month, you'll find

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.780
that it's quite unlikely.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.680
In fact, you'll find the
probability of this happening

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:16.210
is only about 3 percent, of it
happening just by accident.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.180
What's wrong with
the logic here?

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.670
Yes?

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.010
STUDENT: They only studied
diagnosed anorexics.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.210
PROFESSOR: No, because they were
only interested in the

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.700
question of when are anorexics
born, so it made sense to only

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:31.390
study those.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.630
Now maybe you're right, that we
could study that, in fact,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.860
more people are born
in June period.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.740
That could be true.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.100
This would be one of
the fallacies we

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.220
looked at before, right?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.990
That there's a lurking variable
which is just that

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.550
people are more likely
to be born in June.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.610
So that's certainly
a possibility.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.320
What else?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.370
What else is the flaw?

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:04.610
Where's the flaw
in this logic?

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.680
Well, what did they do?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.380
They participated in the
Oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.960
What they did is, they looked
at 12 months, they took the

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.190
months with the most births in
it, which happened to be June,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.460
and calculated the probability
of 3 percent.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.130
They didn't start with the
hypothesis that it was June.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.770
They started with 12 months, and
then they drew a bullseye

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.890
around June.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.560
So the right question to ask
is, what's the probability,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.930
not that June had 48 babies, but
that at least one of the

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:55.090
12 months had 48 babies.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:04.570
That probability is a lot to
higher than 3 percent, right?

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:10.540
In fact, it's about
30 percent.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:17.750
So what we see is, again
perfectly reasonable

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.440
statistical techniques, but
not looking at things

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.810
in the right way.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.760
And answering the
wrong question.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.100
That make sense to everybody?

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.990
And you can see why people can
fall into this trap, right?

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.820
It was a perfectly sensible,
seemingly sensible argument.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.560
So the moral of this particular
thing is, be very

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:48.840
careful about looking at your
data, drawing a conclusion,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.330
and then saying how probable
was that to have occurred?

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.120
Because again, you're probably,
or maybe, drawing

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.790
the bullseye around something
that's already there.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:05.840
Now if they had taken another
set of 446 anorexics, and

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.390
again June was the month,
then there would be some

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.320
credibility in it.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.560
Because they would have started
with the hypothesis,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.700
not that there existed a month,
but that June was

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.480
particularly likely.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.300
But then they would have to also
check and make sure that

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.690
June isn't just a popular
month to be born, as was

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.500
suggested earlier.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.560
All right, I could go on and
on with this sort of thing,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.990
it's kind of fun.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.210
But I won't.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.900
Instead I'm going to torture
you with yet one more

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.310
simulation.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.420
You may be tempted at this
point to just zone out.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.100
Try not to.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.460
And as an added incentive for
you to pay attention, I'm

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.300
going to warn you that this
particular simulation will

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:58.080
appear in the final,
or a variant of it.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.160
And what we'll be doing is,
early next week we'll be

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.790
distributing code, which we'll
ask you to study, about two or

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.580
three pages of code, and then
on the final we'll be asking

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.570
you questions about the code.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.140
Not that you have to memorize
it, we'll give

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.690
you a copy of it.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.140
But you should understand
it before you walk

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.750
in to take the final.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.130
Because there will not be time
to look at that code for the

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.720
first time during the
quiz, and figure

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.130
out what it's doing.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:38.640
OK, so let's look at it.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.930
I should also warn you that this
code includes some Python

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.100
concepts, at least one, that
you have not yet seen.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.370
We'll see it briefly today.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.950
This is on purpose, because one
of the things I hope you

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.520
have learned to do this
semester, is look up things

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.760
you don't know, and figure
out what they do.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.810
What they mean.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.830
Because we obviously can't, in
any course, or even any set of

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.270
courses, tell you everything
you'll ever

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.150
want to know in life.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:10.290
So intentionally, we've seeded
some things in this program

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.190
that will be unfamiliar, so
during the time you're

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.440
studying the program, get
online, look it up, figure out

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.150
what they do.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.580
If you have trouble, we will be
having office hours, where

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.920
you can go and get some help.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.720
But the TAs will expect you to
have at least tried to figure

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.620
it out yourself.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:27.980
Yeah?

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.420
STUDENT: Will the final
be open note?

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.450
PROFESSOR: Final will be open
book, open notes, just like

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.570
the quizzes.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.680
It will be the first two hours
of the allotted time, we won't

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.400
go the whole 3 hours, OK?

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.300
So it won't be hugely longer
than the quizzes.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.700
It would be a little
bit longer.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:56.250
And again, very much in the
same style of the quizzes.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.350
All right, let's look at this.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.990
Let's assume that you've won the
lottery, and have serious

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:09.570
money that you foolishly wish to
invest in the stock market.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:15.890
There are two basic strategies
to choose from, in investing.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:27.450
You can either have what's
called an indexed portfolio,

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:41.510
or a managed portfolio.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.300
Indexed portfolios, you
basically say, I want to own

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.430
all of the stocks that there
are, and if the stock market

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.630
goes up, I make money, if
the stock market goes

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.160
down, I lose money.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.760
I'm not going to be thinking
I'm clever, and can pick

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.350
winners and losers, I'm
just betting on

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:00.000
the market as a whole.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.570
They're attractive, in
that a, they don't

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.660
require a lot of thought.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.270
And b, they have what's called
a low expense ratio, since

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.660
they're easy to implement, you
don't pay anyone to be

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.670
brilliant to implement
if for you.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.100
So they're very low fees.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.090
A managed portfolio, you find
somebody you think is really

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:26.680
smart, and you pay them a fair
amount of money, and in return

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.420
they assert that they will pick
winners for you, and in

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.420
fact, you will outperform
the stock market.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.600
And if it goes up 6 percent,
well you'll go up 10 percent

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.460
or more, and if it goes down,
don't worry, I'm so smart your

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:45.200
stocks won't go down.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.520
There's a lot of debate
about which is the

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:52.800
better of these two.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.570
And so now we're going to try
and see if we can write a

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:01.190
simulation that will give us
some insight as to which of

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.010
these might be better
or worse.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:10.780
All right, so that's
the basic problem.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:16.110
Now, as we know, and by the way
we're not going to write a

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.600
perfect simulation here, because
we're going to try and

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.070
do it in 40 minutes,
or 30 minutes.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.590
And it would take at least an
hour do a perfect simulation

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.140
of the stock market.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.090
All right.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.190
First thing we need to do is
have some sort of a theory.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.730
When we did the spring, we had
this theory of Hooke's Law

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.010
that told us something, and we
built a simulation, or built

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.830
some tools around that theory.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.460
Now we need to think about a
model of the stock market.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.190
And the model we're going to use
is based on what's called

00:14:53.190 --> 00:15:00.840
the Efficient Market
Hypothesis.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.070
So the moral here, again, is
whenever you're doing an

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.490
implementation of a simulation,
you do need to

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:12.210
have some underlying theory
about the model.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.900
What this model asserts
is that markets are

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:31.130
informationally efficient.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.280
That is to say, current prices
reflect all publicly known

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:43.510
information about each stock,
and therefore are unbiased.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.860
That if people thought that
the stock was underpriced,

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.170
well people would buy more of
it in the price would have

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.070
risen already.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.570
If people thought the stock was
overpriced, well, people

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.810
would have tried to sell it, and
it would have come down.

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.420
So this is a very popular
theory, believed by many

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:06.880
famous economists today, and
in the past. And says, OK,

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.700
that effectively means that
the market is memoryless.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.330
OK, that it doesn't matter what
the price of the stock

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.610
was yesterday.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.100
Today, it's priced given the
best-known information, and so

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:29.900
tomorrow it's equally likely
to go up or down.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.640
Relative to the whole
market, right?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.640
It's well known that over
periods of multiple decades,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.090
the market has a tendency
to go up.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.620
And so there's an upward bias to
the stock market, contrary

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.150
to what you may have
seen recently.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.480
But that no particular stock
is more or less likely to

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.610
outperform the market, because
all the information is

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.690
incorporated in the price.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:01.100
And that leads to a notion of
being able to model the

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.800
market, how?

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.010
How would you model individual
stocks if you believe this

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:14.350
hypothesis?

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.520
Somebody?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.340
What's going to happen?

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.640
STUDENT: Random walk.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.910
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly right.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.260
So we would model it
as a random walk.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.110
In fact, there's a very famous
book called A Random Walk Down

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:30.240
Wall Street, that was one of
the first to make this

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.040
hypothesis.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.730
Now later, we may decide to
abandon this model, but for

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:43.010
the moment let's accept that.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.500
And let's think about how
we're going to build the

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.810
simulation.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:58.190
Whenever I think about how to
build an interesting program,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.070
and I hope whenever you think
about it, the first thing I

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:05.720
think about is, what are the
classes I might want to have,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.680
what are the types?

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.130
And it seems pretty obvious
that at least two of the

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:18.070
things I'm going to want
are stock and market.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.770
After all, I'm going to try and
build a simulation of the

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.170
stock market, so I might as
well have the notion of a

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:31.330
market, and probably the
notion of a stock.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.880
Which should I implement
first?

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:40.200
Well, my usual style of
programming would be to

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.260
implement the one that's lowest
down in the hierarchy,

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.370
near the bottom.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.810
I won't be able to show you what
a market does unless I

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:55.430
have stocks, but I can look at
what an individual stock does

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.120
without having a market.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.620
So why do I implement
this first?

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:06.080
Because it will be easier to
unit test. I can build class

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.780
stock, and I can test class
stock, before I

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:16.080
have a class market.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:30.740
So now let's look at it.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:38.510
Clean up the desktop
a little bit.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.490
This is similar to, but not
identical to, what you have in

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:48.390
your handout.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.150
All right, so there's
class stock.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:58.350
And I'm going to initialize
it, create them, with an

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.710
opening price.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.400
When a stock is first listed in
the market, it comes with

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.040
some price.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.550
I'm gonna keep as part of each
stock, it's history of prices,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.860
which we can initialize, well,
I've initialized it as empty,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.210
but that's probably the
wrong thing, right?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:26.500
I probably should have had it
being the, starting here,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:32.040
right, the opening price.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.650
Now comes an interesting part.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.620
Self dot distribution.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:46.990
Well, I lied to you a little bit
in my description of what

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:53.760
it meant to have the Efficient
Market Hypothesis.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:59.670
I said that no stock is likely
to outperform the market or

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.480
underperform the market.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.980
But it's not quite true, because
typically what they

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:21.120
actually do that, is they say
it's adjusted for risk.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.240
It's clear that some stocks are
more volatile than others.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.830
If you will buy stock in an
electrical utility which has a

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.940
guaranteed revenue stream,
because no matter how bad the

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.790
economy gets, a lot of people
still use electricity, you

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:43.450
don't expect it to
fluctuate a lot.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:49.850
If you buy stock in a high
tech company, that sells

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:53.580
things on the internet, you
might expect it to fluctuate

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.160
enormously.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.570
Or if you buy stock in a
retailer, you might expect it

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.530
to go up or down more
dramatically with the economy,

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.470
and so in fact there is a notion
of risk, and I'm not

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.370
going to do this in this
simulation, but usually people

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.240
have to be paid to take risk.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.660
And so it's usually the case
that you can get a higher

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.870
return if you're willing
to take more risk.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:27.420
We might or might not have time
to come back to that.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:32.980
But more generally, the point
is, that each stock actually

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.150
behaves a little bit
differently.

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.350
There's a distribution
of how it would move.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:45.040
So even if, on average, the
stock is expected to not move

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:50.840
at all from where it starts,
some stocks will be expected

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.500
to just trundle along
without much

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.630
change, not very volatile.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:02.550
And other stocks might jump up
and down a lot because they're

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.370
very volatile.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.240
Even if the expected value
is the same, they'd

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.300
move around a lot.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.500
So how can we model this
kind of thing?

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.930
Well, we've already looked
at the basic notion.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.850
Last time we looked at the
notion, last lecture we looked

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:25.640
at the idea of a distribution.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.610
And when we do a simulation,
we're pulling the samples from

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.330
some distribution.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.340
It could be normal, everything,
that would be a

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.530
Gaussian, where if you recall
there was a mean, and a

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:47.510
standard deviation, and most
values were going to be close

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:49.480
to the mean.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.170
Especially if there is a small
standard deviation.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:56.340
If there's a large standard
deviation it would be spread.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.680
Or it could be uniform,
where every

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.190
value was equally probable.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.560
We also looked at exponential.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:08.300
So we're going to assign to each
stock, when we create it,

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.230
a distribution.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:17.330
Some way of visualizing, or
thinking about, where we draw

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.370
the price changes from.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:26.880
This gets us into a new
linguistic concept, which

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.790
we'll see down here.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.310
You don't have this particular
code on your handout, you do

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.340
have a code that uses
the same concept.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:39.430
So here's my unit
test procedure.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.240
And here's where I'm going
to create distributions.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.460
And I'm going to look at two.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.930
A random-- a uniform,
and a Gaussian.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:56.810
What lambda that does, it
creates on the fly a function,

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.370
as the program runs.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.440
That I can then pass around.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.520
So here, I'm going to look at
the thing random dot uniform,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.880
for example, between minus
volatility and plus

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.270
volatility.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.710
So ignoring the lambda, what
do we expect random dot

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.340
uniform to do?

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:26.020
It has equally likely, in the
range from minus volatility to

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:35.470
plus volatility, it will return
any value in here.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.640
But notice the previous line,
where I am computing

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.620
volatility.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:47.680
If I wanted every stock to have
the same volatility, I

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.710
could just do that, if
you will, at the

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.940
time I wrote my program.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.240
But here I want it
to be determined,

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.280
chosen at run time.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:03.070
So first, I choose a volatility
randomly, from some

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.950
distribution of possible
volatilities from 0 to, in

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:12.930
this case, 0.2.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:17.140
Think of this as the percentage
move per day.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:22.070
So 2/10 of a percent, would
be the move here.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:28.130
And then I'll create this
function, this distribution d

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.720
1, which will, whenever I call
it, give me a random, a

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.930
uniformly selected value
between minus and plus

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.210
volatility.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:48.670
Then when I create the stock,
here, I can pass it

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:54.040
in, pass in d 1.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.310
OK, it's a new concept.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:58.240
I don't expect you'll all
immediately grab it, but you

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:05.000
will need to understand it
before the quiz comes along.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.110
And then I could also do a
Gaussian one here, with the

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.230
mean of 0 and the standard
deviation of volatility

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.530
divided by 2.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:15.260
Where do these parameters
come from?

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.530
I made them up out
of whole cloth.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.620
Later we'll talk about how 1
could think about them more

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.710
intelligently.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:29.210
Now what do I do with that?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.040
All right, we'll see
that in a minute.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:38.120
But people understand what
the basic idea here is.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:44.110
Now, I can set the
price of a stock.

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:47.910
And when I do that, I'll
append it to history.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.380
I can, oh, these have got
some remnants which we

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.330
really don't need.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:58.290
I'll get rid of this which is
just an uninteresting thing.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:05.020
And let's look at make move.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.490
Because this is the
interesting thing.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:11.520
Make move is what we call to
change the price of a stock,

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.800
at the beginning or end
of a day if you will.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.730
So the first thing it does, is
it says, if self dot price is

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.360
0, I'm just going to return.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.550
This is not the right thing
to do, by the way.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.790
Again, there are some
bugs in here.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.120
You won't find these bugs
in your handout, right?

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.240
Code is different
in the handout.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.400
But I wanted to show these to
you so we could think about.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.820
What I'm more interested in here
than in the result of the

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.220
simulation, is the process
of creating it.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:48.400
So why did I put this here?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.900
Why did I say if self dot
price equals 0 return?

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.660
Because the first time I wrote
the program, I didn't have

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:00.730
anything like that here,
and a stock could go

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.040
to 0 and then recover.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.650
Or even go to negative values.

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:09.110
Well we know stock prices
are never negative.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.010
And in fact we know if the price
goes to 0, it's delisted

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.460
from the exchange.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.460
So I said, all right, we better
make a special case of

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:24.130
that. it turns out, that this
will be a bug, and I want you

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:29.740
to think about why it's wrong
for me to put this check here.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.750
The check needs to be somewhere
in the program, but

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:36.270
this is not the right
place for it.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.640
So think about why I didn't
leave it here.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.620
OK, then we'll get the old
price, which we're going to

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:49.180
try and remember, and now comes
the interesting part.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.010
We're going to try and
figure out how the

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.840
price should change.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.650
So I'm first going to
compute something

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.650
called the base move.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.280
Think of this as kind of the
basis from which we'll be

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.880
computing the actual move.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:12.030
I'll draw something from the
distribution, so this is

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.720
interesting, I'm now calling
self dot distribution, and

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.270
remember this will be different
for each stock.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.840
It will return me some random
value from either the Gaussian

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.460
or the normal distribution.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.840
With a different volatility for
the stocks because that

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.340
was also selected randomly,
plus some market bias.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.670
Saying, well, the market on
average will go up a little

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.530
bit, or go down a little bit.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.500
And then I'll set the new price,
if you will, self dot

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:52.240
price, to self dot price times
1 plus the base move.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.410
So notice what this says.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:31:00.670
If the base move is 0, then
the price doesn't change.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:02.740
So that makes sense.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.780
Interesting question.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:12.800
Why do you think I said self
dot price times 1 plus the

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.280
base move, rather than just
adding the base move to the

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.480
stock, price of the stock?

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:22.090
Again, the first time I coded
this, I had an addition there

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.710
instead of a multiplication.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:31.190
What would the ramifications
of an addition there be?

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.360
That would say, how much the
stock changed is independent

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.430
of its current price.

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:43.780
And when I ran that it, I got
weird results, because we know

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:49.750
that a Google priced at, say,
300, is much more likely to

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:53.440
move by 10 points in
a day than a stock

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.290
that's priced at $0.50.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.120
So in fact, it is the case, if
you look at data, and by the

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.360
way, that's the way I ended
up setting a lot of these

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.840
parameters and playing with
it, was comparing what my

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.190
simulation said to historical
stock data.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.540
And indeed it is the case that
the price of the stock, the

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.060
move, the amount of move, tends
to be proportional to

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.130
the price of the stock.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.910
Expensive stocks move more.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.430
Interestingly enough, the
percentage moves are not much

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:29.630
different between cheap stocks
and expensive stocks.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:34.770
And that's why, I ended up using
a multiplicative factor,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:47.880
rather than an additive
factor.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.060
This is again a general
lesson.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.150
As you build these kinds of
simulations, or anything like

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:57.950
this, you need to think through
whether things should

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.880
be multiplicative or additive.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.160
Because you get very different
results, typically.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.270
Multiplicative is what you want
to do if the amount of

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.900
change is proportional to the
current size, whether it's

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.970
price or anything else, and
additive if the change is

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.840
independent of the current
value, typically, is I think

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:27.140
the general way to
think about it.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.350
Now, you'll see this other
kind of peculiar thing.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:39.880
So I've now set the price, and
then I've got this test here.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:45.570
If mo, mo stands for momentum.

00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:53.390
I'm now exploring the question
of whether or not stock prices

00:33:53.390 --> 00:34:03.000
are indeed memoryless,
or the stock changes.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.240
And the fancy word for
that is Poisson.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:14.710
People often model things as
Poisson processes, which is to

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:20.410
say, processes in which past
behavior has no impact on

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:24.030
future behavior, it's
memoryless.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:29.200
And in fact, that's what the
Efficient Market Hypothesis

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.940
purports to say.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.930
It says that, since all the
information is in the current

00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.790
price, you don't have to worry
about whether it went up or

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:45.610
down yesterday, to decide what
it's going to do today.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:48.500
There are people who don't
believe that, and instead

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.470
argue that there is this
notion called momentum.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:54.690
These are called momentum
investors.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.180
And they say, what's most likely
to happen today, is

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.110
what happened yesterday.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.490
Or more likely.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.810
If the stock went up yesterday,
it's more likely to

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:08.360
go up today, than if it didn't
go up yesterday.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.180
So I wasn't sure which religion
I was willing to

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.910
believe in, if either, so I
added a parameter called, if

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.870
you believe in momentum,
then you should change

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.970
the price by --

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.310
And here I just did something
taking a Gaussian times the

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:32.230
last change, and, in
fact, added it in.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.610
So if it went up yesterday, it
will more likely go up today,

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.130
because I'm throwing in a
positive number, otherwise a

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:41.430
negative number.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.750
Notice that this is additive.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:48.910
Because it's dealing with
yesterday's price.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.140
Change, with the change.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:56.740
OK, so that's why we're
dealing with that.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:59.950
Now, here's where I should've
put in this test

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.660
that I had up here.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.850
Get it out from there.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.860
Because what I want to do is,
say if self dot price is less

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:14.390
than 0.01, I'm going to set it
to 0, just keep it there.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:19.770
That doesn't solve the problem
we had before though, right?

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:26.020
Then I'm going to append it, and
keep the last change for

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.360
future use.

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.220
OK, people understand what's
going on here?

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.140
And then show history is just
going to produce a plot.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.990
We've seen that a million
times before.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.840
Any questions about this?

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.480
Well, I have a question?

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.640
Does it make any sense?

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.000
Is it going to work at all?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.220
So now let's test it.

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:57.790
So, I now have this
unit test program

00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:01.360
called unit test stock.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.450
I originally did not make it a
function, I had it in-line,

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.600
and I realized that was really
stupid, because I wanted to do

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.720
it a lot of times.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.710
So it's got an internal
procedure, internal function,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:20.260
local to the unit test, that
runs the simulation.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:25.880
And it takes the set of stocks
to simulate, a fig, figure

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.290
number, this is going to print
a bunch of graphs, and I want

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.320
to say what graph it is,
and whether or not I

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.940
believe in big mo.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.470
It sets the mean to 0, and then
for s in the stocks, it

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:46.340
moves it, giving it the bias
and the momentum, then it

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:49.190
shows the history.

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:53.440
And then computes the mean of,
getting me the mean of all the

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.160
stocks in it.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.570
We've seen this sort of thing
many times before.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.810
I've then got some constants.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.190
By the way, I want to emphasize
that I've named

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.860
these constants to make
it easier to change.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:10.710
Starting with 20 stocks,
100 days.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:15.940
And then what I do is, I stock
sub 1, stocks 1 will be the

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.430
empty list, stocks 2 is the
empty list. Why do you think

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:27.010
I'm starting with bias of 0?

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:32.490
Because, what do you think the
mean should be, if I simulate

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:35.990
various things that
the bias of 0?

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.585
I start $100 as the average
price of the stock, what

00:38:39.585 --> 00:38:42.240
should the average price
of the stock be?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.350
If my code is correct, what
should the average price be,

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:50.270
after say, 100 days,
if there's no bias.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.480
Pardon?

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.810
100, exactly.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.580
Since there's no upward
or downward bias.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.130
They may fluctuate wildly, but
if I look at enough stocks,

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.600
the average should be
right around 100.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.690
I don't know what the average
would be if I chose a

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.080
different bias.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.940
It's a little bit complicated,
so I chose the simplest bias.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.360
Important lesson, so that
there would be some

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.250
predictability in the results,
and I would have some, if you

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:22.300
will, smoke test for knowing
whether or not I was getting,

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.530
my code seemed to be working.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:31.800
All right, and initially, well,
maybe initially, just to

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:39.360
be simple I'm going to start
momentum equal to false.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.990
Because, again, it seems simpler
have a model where

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.790
there's no momentum.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.630
I'm looking for the simplest
model possible for the first

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.230
time I run it.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.780
And then we looked at this
little loop before, for i in

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:55.470
range number of stocks, I'm
going to create two different

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.330
lists of stocks, one where the
moves, or distributions, are

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:04.530
chosen from a uniform, and the
other where they're Gaussian.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.780
Because I'm sort of curious as
to, again, which is the right

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:14.090
way to think about
this, all right?

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:18.940
And then, I'm going
to just call it.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.030
We'll see what we get.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.780
So let's do it.

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.730
Let's hope that all the
changes I mad have not

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:29.920
introduced a syntax error.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.670
All right, well at least
it did something.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:39.750
Let's see what it did.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:43.740
So the test on the left, you'll
remember, was the one

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.930
with test one, I believe, was
the uniform distribution, and

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.180
test two is the Gaussian.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.290
So, but let's, what should
we do first?

00:40:55.290 --> 00:41:00.240
Well, let's do the smoke test
number one: is the mean more

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.790
or less what we expected?

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.740
Well, it looks like it's dead on
100, which was our initial

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:09.120
price in test two.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.440
And in test one it's a
little bit above 100.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.960
But, we didn't do that many
stocks, or that many days, so

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:24.230
it's quite plausible
that it's correct.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:28.000
But, just to be sure, not to be
sure, but just to increase

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:46.740
my confidence, I'm going
to just run it again.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:51.110
Well, here I'm a little bit
below 100 and in two, and test

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:53.510
one a little bit below
100 as well.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.820
You remember last time was
a little bit above 100.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.900
I feel pretty good about this,
and in fact I ran it a lot of

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.540
times in my office.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.100
And it just bounces around,
hovering around 100.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.760
Course, this is the wrong
way to do it.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.690
I should really just put it in
a nice test harness, where I

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:14.370
run 100, 200, 1,000 trials, but
I didn't want to bore you

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.930
with that here.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:20.950
So we'll see that, OK, we passed
the first smoke test.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:25.130
We seem to be where
we expect to be.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:30.080
Well, let's try smoke
test two.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.420
What else might we want to see,
to see if we got things

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.580
working properly?

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:39.590
Well, I kind of ignored the
notion of bias by making it 0,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:49.730
so let's give it a
big bias here.

00:42:49.730 --> 00:43:09.830
Assuming it will
let me edit it.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.550
We just gotta start it
up again, it's the

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:34.890
safest thing to do.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.120
You wouldn't think I would
have, I don't have -- all

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.800
right, be that way about it.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.440
Fortunately, we've been
through this before.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.750
We know if we relaunch
the Finder.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:58.300
Who says Mac OS is flawless?

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:07.290
All right, we were down here,
and I was saying, let's try a

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.490
larger, introduce a bias.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.580
Again, we're trying to see
if it does what we

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.970
think it might do.

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:17.020
So what do you think it
should do with a bias?

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.710
Where should the mean be now?

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:24.730
Still around 100?

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.300
Or higher, right?

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.660
Because we've now put in
a bias suggesting that

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.460
it should go up.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.090
Oops.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.720
It wouldn't have hurt it.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.550
All right.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:49.730
So let's run it.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:54.220
Sure enough, for one, we see,
test two, it's a little bit

00:44:54.220 --> 00:45:02.760
over 100, and for test one
it's way over 100.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:11.130
Well, let's make sure
it's not a fluke.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:21.730
Try it again.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:26.940
So, sure enough, changing the
bias changed the price, and

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.170
even changed it in the
right direction.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.990
So we can feel pretty
comfortable that it's doing

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.380
something good with that.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.350
We could also feel pretty
comfortable that that's

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.140
probably way too high
a bias, right?

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.740
We would not expect that the
mean should be over 160, or in

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.850
one case, 150, after only
100 days trading, right?

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:53.580
Things don't typically go
up 50% in 100 days.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:46:00.000
They go down 50%, but --

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.590
All right, so that's good.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:06.960
Oh, let's look at something
else now.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.360
Let's go back to where,
a simpler bias here.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.440
We'll run it again.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.910
And think about, what's the
difference between the

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:26.110
Gaussian and the normal?

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:35.490
Can we deduce anything
about those?

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.870
Not, well, let me ask you.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:45.260
What do you think, yes or no?

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.450
Anybody see anything
interesting here?

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.730
Yeah?

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:52.625
STUDENT: The variance of the
Gaussian seems to be less than

00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:54.860
the variance of the uniform.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:55.960
PROFESSOR: The variance
of the Gaussian --

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.620
STUDENT: -- is less.

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:02.810
PROFESSOR: So all right, that
appears to be the case here.

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:04.860
But let's run it again,
as we've done with

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.490
all the other tests.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.680
So we have a hypothesis.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.440
Let's not fall victim to the
Oklahoma sharpshooter.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:19.860
We'll test our hypothesis, or at
least examine it again, see

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:27.230
if it's, in some sense,
repeatable.

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:32.860
Well, now what do we see?

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.880
Doesn't seem to be true
this time, right?

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:37.960
Not obviously.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.240
So, we're not sure about this.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.960
So this is something
that we would need

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:49.420
to investigate further.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.320
And we would need, to have to
look at it, and it's going to

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:57.470
be very tricky, by the way, as
to what the right answer is.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:04.200
But if you think about it, it
would not be surprising if the

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.350
Gaussians, at least, gave us
some surprising, more extreme,

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:12.030
results, than the uniform.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.950
Because the uniform, as we've
set it up here, is bounded.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:22.280
The minimum and the maximum
is bounded.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:26.950
With the Gaussian,
there's a tail.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.830
And you might every once in a
while get this, at least as

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.450
we've done it in this
case, this large

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.570
move out at the end.

00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.790
You might not.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.460
There's nothing profound about
this, other than the

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.350
understanding that the details
of how you set these things up

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:47.210
can matter a lot.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:54.770
Well, the final thing I want
to look at is momentum.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:49:07.040
So let's go back, and let's
set mo to true here.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.930
Well, doesn't want us to
set mo to true here.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:16.720
Ah, there it does.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.460
So, and now let's run it
and see what happens.

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:25.850
What do you think
should happen?

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:26.410
Anybody?

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:31.726
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:31.726 --> 00:49:36.620
PROFESSOR: I think
you're right.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.420
These ones should curl, see
if I can -- oh, not bad.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:48.610
Let's run it.

00:49:48.610 --> 00:49:53.460
Well, it's a little hard
to see, but things

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.500
tend to take off.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.895
Because once things started
moving, it tends to move in

00:49:59.895 --> 00:50:05.640
that direction.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.710
All right.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.750
How do we go about choosing
these parameters?

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.880
How do we go about deciding
what to do?

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.510
Well, we play with it, the way
I've been playing with it, and

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:22.490
compare the results to some
set of real data.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:26.820
And then we try and get our
simulation to match the past,

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.600
and hope that that will help
it predict the future.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.480
We're not enough time to
go through all the,

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.460
to do that a lot.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.850
I will be posting code that
you can play with, and I

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:42.850
suggest you go through exactly
this kind of exercise.

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.590
Because this is really the way
that people do develop

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.930
simulations.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.810
They don't, out of whole
cloth, get it

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:50.700
right the first time.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:54.580
They build them, they do what if
games, they play with them,

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.870
and then they try and adjust
them to get them right.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:00.980
The nice thing here is, you can
decide whether you believe

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:04.370
momentum and see what it would
mean, or not mean, etc.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.940
All right, one more lecture.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.140
See you guys next week.
