00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.450
PROFESSOR: I want to take a few
minutes at the start of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.620
today's lecture to wrap
up a few more

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.460
things about debugging.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.470
And then I'll move on
to the main event.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.750
Just a few small points.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.030
First of all, keep in mind that
the bug is probably not

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.970
where you think it is.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.860
Because if a bug were there,
you'd have already found it.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.020
There are some simple things
that you should always look at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.940
when you're looking for bugs.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.590
Reversed order of arguments.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.850
You might have a function that
takes to floats and you just

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.080
passed them in the
wrong order.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.190
You may have noticed that when
Professor Grimson and I used

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.650
examples in class, we were
pretty careful how we name our

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.500
parameters.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.720
And I often end up using the
same names for the actuals and

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.380
the formals.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.740
And this just helps me not get
confused about what order to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.030
do things in.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.310
Spelling.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.220
These are just dumb little
things to look for.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.200
Did you spell all the
identifiers the way

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.970
you think you did.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.980
The problem is, when you
read code you see what

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.190
you expect to see.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.870
And if you've typed in l when
you should've typed a 1, or a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.320
1 when you should've typed an
l, you're likely to miss it.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.990
If you've made a mistake with
upper and lower case.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.540
Things like that.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.060
So just be very careful
looking at that.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.500
Initialization.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.060
A very common bug is to
initialize a variable.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.530
Go through a loop, and then
forget to reinitialize it when

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.280
it needs to be reinitialized
again.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.890
So it's initialized outside
the loop when it should be

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.390
initialized inside the loop.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.460
Or conversely, inside the
loop when it should

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.820
be outside the loop.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.020
So look carefully at when
variables are being

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.330
initialized.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.180
Object versus value equality.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.180
Particularly when you use double
equals, are you asking

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.130
whether you've got the same
object or the same value?

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.750
They mean very different things,
as we have seen.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.060
Keep track of that.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.390
Related to that is aliasing.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.470
And you'll see that, by the way,
on the problem set that

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380
we're posting tomorrow.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.410
Where we're going to ask you
to just look at some code,

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.360
that there's some issues there
with the fact that you alias

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.910
things, maybe on purpose,
maybe on accident.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.290
And by that I mean two different
ways to get to the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.240
same value, the same object.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.010
Frequently that introduces
bugs into the program.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:42.860
A particular instance of that
is deep versus shallow copy.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.750
When you decide to make a copy
of something like a list, you

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.360
have to think hard about are you
only copying the top level

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.070
of the list, but if it's, say,
a list that contains a list,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.990
are you also getting
a new copy of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.030
everything it contains?

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.750
It doesn't matter if it's a list
of integers or a list of

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.630
strings or a list of tuples, but
it matters a lot if it's a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.750
list of lists.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.910
Or a list of anything that
could be mutable.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.680
So when you copy, what
are you getting?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.620
When you copy a dictionary,
for example.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.810
Think through all of that.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.780
And again, a related problem
that people run into is

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.190
side-effects.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.510
You call a function and it
returns a value, but maybe it,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.590
on purpose or on accident,
modifies one of the actual

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.300
parameters.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.680
So you could each make
a list of things.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.290
Every experienced programmer
over time develops a personal

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.470
model of the mistakes
they make.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.650
I know the kinds of things
I get wrong.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.075
And so when I'm looking for a
bug, I always say, oh, have

00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:04.030
you done this dumb thing
you always do.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.790
So be a little bit
introspective.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.970
Keep track of the mistakes
you make.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.690
And if your program doesn't
work, that should be your

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.570
first guess.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.360
Couple of other hints.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:30.330
Keep a record of what
you've tried.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.800
People will look at things and
they'll come in and that'll

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.030
talk to a TA, and the TA will
say, did you try this?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.500
And the person will
say, I don't know.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.620
That leads you to end up
doing the same thing

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.150
over and over again.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.440
This gets back to my main theme
of Tuesday, which is be

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.220
systematic.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.720
Know what you've already tried,
don't waste your time

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.600
trying it again.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:08.700
Think about reconsidering
your assumptions.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.320
A huge one is, are you actually
running the code

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.670
you're looking at
in your editor.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.020
This is a mistake I make
all the time in Python.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.350
I sit there in idle, and
I edit some code.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.140
I then click on the shell,
rather than hitting F5, try

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.710
and run it and say, it's
not doing what I

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.080
thought I should do.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.640
And I'll sit there staring at
the output, staring at the

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.880
code, not realizing that
that output was not

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.160
produced by that code.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.320
It's a mistake I've learned
that I make.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.550
It's an easy one to
make in Python.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.760
Lots of assumptions like that.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.190
You thought you knew what the
built-in function sort did,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.220
method sort did.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.610
Well, does it do what
you think it does?

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.130
Does append do what
you think it does?

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.340
Go back and say, alright,
I've obviously, some

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.220
assumption is not right.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:21.630
When you're debugging somebody
else's code, debug the code,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:27.460
not the comments.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.200
I've often made the mistake
of believing the comments

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.900
somebody wrote in your code
about what some function does.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.860
Sometimes it's good
to believe it.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.850
But sometimes you
have to read it.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.840
Important thing.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.540
When it gets really
tough, get help.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.590
Swallow your pride.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.810
Any one of my graduate students
will tell you that

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.470
from time to time I walk into
their office and say, do you

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.080
have a minute?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.960
And if they foolishly say yes,
I drag them back to my office

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.010
and say I'm stuck on this bug,
what am I doing wrong?

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.030
And it's amazing what -- well,
a, they're smarter than I am

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.030
which helps.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:18.040
But even if they weren't smarter
than I am, just a

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.260
fresh set of eyes.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.710
I've read through the same thing
twenty times and I've

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.260
missed something obvious.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.365
Someone who's never seen it
before looks at and says, did

00:08:27.365 --> 00:08:31.230
you really mean to do this?

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.890
Are you sure you didn't want to
do for i in range of list,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.800
rather than for i in list?

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.540
That sort of thing.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.560
Makes a big difference to just
get that set of eyes.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.180
And in particular, try and
explain to somebody else what

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.780
you think the program
is doing.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.850
So I'll sit there with the
student and I'll say, I'm

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.630
going to try and explain to
you why what I think this

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.120
program is doing.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.760
And probably 80% of the time,
halfway through my

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.400
explanation, I say,
oh, never mind.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.240
I'm embarrassed.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.180
And I send them away.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.520
Because just the act of
explaining it to him or her

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.920
has helped me understand it.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.060
So when you're really stuck,
just get somebody.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.530
And try and explain to them why
you think your program is

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.060
doing what it's doing.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.930
Another good thing to do
when you're really

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:36.460
stuck is walk away.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.230
Take a break.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.810
Come back and look at it with
fresh eyes of your own.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.480
Effectively, what you're doing
here is perhaps trading

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.510
latency for efficiency.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.400
It may, if you go back, come
back and two hours later,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.380
maybe you'll, it'll take you
at least two hours to have

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.000
found the bugs, because you've
been away for two hours.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.390
And maybe if you'd stayed there
and worked really hard

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.280
you'd have found it an hour
and fifty eight minutes.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.970
But is it really worth
the two minutes?

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.990
This is another reason, by
the way, to start it

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.710
long before it's due.

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.580
That you actually have the
leisure to walk away.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.640
All right.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.570
What do you do when you've
found the bug and

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.480
you need to fix it?

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:30.610
Remember the old saw,
haste makes waste.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:36.200
I don't know this but I'll bet
Benjamin Franklin said this.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.920
Don't rush into anything.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.110
Think about the fix, don't make
the first change that

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.540
comes to mind and
see if it works.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.640
Ask yourself, will it fix all
of the symptoms you've seen?

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.620
Or if not, are the symptoms
independent, will at least fix

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.980
some of them?

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.010
What are the ramifications
of the proposed change.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.020
Will it break other things?

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.930
That's a big issue.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.390
You can fix one thing, you
break something else.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.710
So think through what this
change might break.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:15.060
Does it allow you to tidy
up other things?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:22.890
This is important, I
think, that code

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:31.070
should not always grow.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:36.840
We all have a tendency to
fix code by adding code.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.810
And the program just gets bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.070
The more code you have, the
harder it is to get it right.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.390
So, sometimes, what you need
to, so you just pull back.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.180
And say, well, let me
just tidy things up.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.900
That, by the way, is also
a good debugging tool.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.680
Sometimes when I'm really stuck,
I say, alright let me

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.840
stop looking for the bug.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.870
Let me just clean up the
code a little bit.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.220
Make my program prettier.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.480
And in the process of tidying it
up and making it prettier,

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.940
I'll often by accident
find the bug.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.160
So it's a good trick
to remember.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:26.650
Finally, and this is very
important, make sure that you

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.100
can revert.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.010
There's nothing more frustrating
then spending four

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:41.800
hours debugging, and realizing
at the end of four hours your

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.550
program is worse than it
was when you started.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:49.320
And you can't get back to where
it was when you started.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:55.020
So if you look at one of my
directories, you'll find that

00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:02.480
I've been pretty anal about
saving old versions.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.770
I can always pretty much get
back to some place I've been.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.160
So if I've made a set of changes
and I realize I've

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.530
broken something that used to
work, I can find a version of

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.340
the code in which it used to
work, and figure out what was

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.270
going on there.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.820
Disk space is cheap.

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.420
Don't hesitate to save
your old versions.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.030
It's a good thing.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:33.750
Alright, that's the end of my,
maybe sermon is the right word

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.900
on debugging.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.360
Polemic, I don't know.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.230
I hope it will be helpful.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.380
And I hope you'll remember some
of these things as you

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.130
try and get your programs
to work.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:48.360
I now want to get back to
algorithms. And where we've

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.960
sort of been for a while,
and where we

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.940
will stay for a while.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.530
More fundamentally, I want to
get back to what I think of as

00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:03.070
the main theme of 6.00, which
is taking a problem and

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:08.190
finding some way to formulate
the problem so that we can use

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:13.280
computing to help us
get an answer.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.630
And in particular, we're going
to spend the next few lectures

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.620
looking at a class of problems
known as optimization

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:36.300
problems. In general,
every optimization

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.300
problem is the same.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.830
It has two parts.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:50.840
Some function that you're either
attempting to maximize

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:57.550
or minimize the value of.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.630
And these are duals.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:14.370
And some set of constraints
that must be honored.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.600
Possibly an empty set
of constraints.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.730
So what are some of the classic
optimization problems?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.990
Well one of the most well-known
is the so-called

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:33.240
shortest path problem.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.660
Probably almost every one
of you has used a

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.930
shortest path algorithm.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.910
For example, if you go to
Mapquest, or Google Maps and

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.520
ask how do I get from
here to there.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.780
You give it the function,
probably in this case to

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.860
minimize, and it gives you
a choice of functions.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.320
Minimize time, minimize
distance.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.450
And maybe you give it a
set of constraints.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.400
I don't want to drive
on highways.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.630
And it tries to find the
shortest way, subject to those

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:10.260
constraints, to get from Point
A to Point B. And there are

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.160
many, many other instances
of this kind of thing.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.690
And tomorrow it's recitation,
we'll spend quite a bit of

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.650
time on shortest
path problems.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:25.730
Another classic optimization
problem is

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.410
the traveling salesman.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:34.520
Actually, I should probably,
be modern, call it the

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:44.250
traveling salesperson, the
traveling salesperson problem.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:49.390
So the problem here, roughly, is
given, a number of cities,

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.810
and say the cost of traveling
from city to city by airplane,

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:59.110
what's the least cost round
trip that you can find?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.390
So you start at one place, you
have to go to a number of

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.470
other places.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:05.290
End up where you started.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.680
It's not quite the same as the
shortest path, and figure out

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.030
the way to do that
that involves

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.880
spending the least money.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.390
Or the least time, or
something else.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:27.490
What are some of the other
classic optimization problems?

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:36.270
There's bin packing.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:41.190
Filling up some container with
objects of varying size and,

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.650
perhaps, shape.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.820
So you've got the trunk of
your car and you've got a

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.230
bunch of luggage.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.600
More luggage than can
actually fit in.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.420
And you're trying to figure
out what order

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.410
to put things in.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.270
And which ones you can put in.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.770
How to fill up that bin.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:59.140
Very important in shipping.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.980
People use bin packing
algorithms to figure out, for

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.870
example, how to load
up container ships.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:05.800
Things of that nature.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:11.340
Moving vans, all sorts of
things of that nature.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.540
In biology and in natural
language processing and many

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:23.420
other things, we see a lot of
sequence alignment problems.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:31.810
For example, aligning DNA
sequences, or RNA sequences.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:37.280
And, one we'll spend a fair
amount of time on today and

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:43.440
Tuesday is the knapsack
problem.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.570
In the old days people used to
call backpacks knapsacks.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.240
So we old folks sometimes even
still make that mistake.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.640
And the problem there is, you've
got a bunch of things.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.520
More than will fit into the
knapsack, and you're trying to

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.400
figure out which things to
take and which things to

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.550
leave. As you plan
your hiking trip.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:05.910
How much water should
you take.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:06.970
How many blankets?

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.550
How much food?

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.640
And you're trying to optimize
the value of the objects you

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.950
can take subject to the
constraint that the backpack

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.310
is of finite size.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:24.860
Now, why am I telling
you all of this at

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.500
this lightning speed?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:33.950
It's because I want you to think
about it, going forward,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:39.140
about the issue of problem
reduction.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:47.730
We'll come back to this.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.290
What this basically means is,
you're given some problem to

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.580
solve, that you've never
seen before.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:20:00.160
And the first thing you do is
ask is it an instance of some

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.020
problem that other people
have already solved?

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.880
So when the folks at Mapquest
sat down to do their program,

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.870
I guarantee you somebody opened
an algorithms book and

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.030
said, what have other
people done to solve

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.200
shortest path problems?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.130
I'll rely on fifty years of
clever people rather than

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.210
trying to invent my own.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.580
And so frequently what we try
and do is, we take a new

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.960
problem and map it onto an old
problem so that we can use an

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.690
old solution.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.420
In order to be able to do that,
it's nice to have in our

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.005
heads an inventory of previously
solved problems. To

00:20:47.005 --> 00:20:50.920
which we can reduce the
current problem.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.000
So as we go through this
semester, we'll look at,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.350
briefly or not so briefly,
different previously solved

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.960
problems in the hope that at
some time in your future, when

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.140
you have a problem to deal
with, you'll say, I know

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.830
that's really like
shortest path, or

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.970
really like graph coloring.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.000
Let me just take my problem and
turn it into that problem,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.970
and use an existing solution.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.970
So we'll start looking in detail
at one problem, and

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:30.120
that's the knapsack problem.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:30.630
Let's see.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.320
Where do I want to start?

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.140
Oh yes, OK.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.590
So far, we've been looking
at problems that

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:41.270
have pretty fast solutions.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:46.810
Most optimization problems do
not have fast solutions.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.610
That is to say, when you're
dealing with a large set of

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:54.210
things, it takes a while to
get the right answer.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.220
Consequently, you have to
be clever about it.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.700
Typically up till now, we've
looked at things that can be

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.240
done in sublinear time.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:09.450
Or, at worst, polynomial time.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.810
We'll now look at a problem that
does not fall into that.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.720
And we'll start with
what's called the

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:22.210
continuous knapsack problem.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.100
So here's the classic
formulation.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.560
Assume that you are a burglar.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.190
And you have a backpack that
holds, say, eight pounds'

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.980
worth of stuff.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.190
And you've now broken into a
house and you're trying to

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:41.530
decide what to take.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.990
Well, let's assume in the
continuous world, what you is

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.480
you walk into the house and you
see something like four

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:59.580
pounds of gold dust. And you
see three pounds of silver

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:06.750
dust, and maybe ten
pounds of raisins.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.550
And I don't actually
know the periodic

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.110
table entry for raisins.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:16.680
So I'll have to write it out.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:21.730
Well, how would you solve
this problem?

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.950
First, let's say, what
is the problem?

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:27.930
How can we formulate it?

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:33.070
Well, let's assume that what
we want to do is, we have

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.440
something we want to optimize.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.430
So we're looking for
a function to

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.630
maximize, in this case.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.180
What might that function be?

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:51.750
Well, let's say it's some number
of, some amount of, the

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:56.440
cost of the value of gold.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.620
Times however many
pounds of gold.

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:08.870
Plus the cost of silver times
however many - no, gold, is a

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.350
g, isn't it.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:18.040
Pounds of silver, plus the
cost of raisins times the

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.270
number of pounds of raisins.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.740
So that's the function
I want to optimize.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:30.710
I want to maximize
that function.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:40.120
And the constraint is what?

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:45.320
It's that the pounds of gold
plus the pounds of silver plus

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:52.110
the pounds of raisins is
no greater than eight.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.970
So I've got a function to
maximize and a constraint that

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.620
must be obeyed.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.700
Now, the strategy here
is pretty clear.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.760
As often is for the continuous
problem.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.310
What's the strategy?

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.710
I pour in the gold till
I run out of gold.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.740
I pour in the silver until
I run out of silver.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.860
And then I take as many raisins
as will fit in and I

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.600
leave. Right?

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.170
I hope almost every one of you
could figure out that was the

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.910
right strategy.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:29.400
If not, you're not well suited
to a life of crime.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.400
What I just described is an

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:43.930
instance of a greedy algorithm.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:48.220
In a greedy algorithm, at
every step you do what

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.570
maximizes your value
at that step.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.240
So there's no planning ahead.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.960
You just do what's ever best.
It's like when someone gets

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.670
their food and they start
by eating dessert.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.550
Just to make sure they
get to the best part

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:07.640
before they're full.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:12.130
In this case, a greedy algorithm
actually gives us

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:18.430
the best possible solution.

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.370
That's not always so.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:22.580
Now, you've actually all

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.430
implemented a greedy algorithm.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.630
Or are in the process thereof.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.800
Where have we implemented a
greedy algorithm, or have been

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.010
asked to do a greedy
algorithm?

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.960
Well, there are not that many
things you guys have been

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.260
working on this semester.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:41.640
Yeah?

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.760
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.470
PROFESSOR: Exactly right.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:27:01.540
So what you were doing there,
it was a really good throw.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:03.670
But it was a really good answer
you gave. So I'll

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:09.700
forgive you the bad hands.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.600
You were asked to choose
the word that gave

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.340
you the maximum value.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:20.820
And then do it again with
whatever letters you had left.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.950
Was that guaranteed to win?

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.120
To give you the best
possible scores?

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.160
No.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:37.940
Suppose, for example, you had
the letters this, doglets.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.360
Well, the highest scoring word
might have been something like

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:50.200
Doges, these guys used to rule
Venice, but if you did that

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.440
you'd been left with the letters
l and t, which are

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.780
kind of hard to use.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.770
So you've optimized
the first step.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.100
But now you're stuck
with something

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.530
that's not very useful.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:10.960
Whereas in fact, maybe you would
have been better to go

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:19.820
with dog, dogs, and let.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.810
So what we see here is an
example of something very

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.890
important and quite general.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:51.600
Which was that locally optimal
decisions do not always lead

00:28:51.600 --> 00:29:05.340
to a global optimums. So you
can't just repeatedly do the

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.970
apparently local thing
and expect to

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.220
necessarily get to it.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.500
Now, as it happens with the
continuous knapsack problem as

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:21.020
we've formulated it,
greedy is good.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:27.710
But let's look for a slight
variant of it, where greedy is

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.240
not so good.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:56.140
And that's what's called the
zero-one knapsack problem.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.310
This is basically a discrete
version of

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.420
the knapsack problem.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:12.590
The formulation is that we have
n items and at every step

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.520
we have to either take
the whole item

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.060
or none of the item.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.980
In the continuous problem, the
gold dust was assumed to be

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.920
infinitely small.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:27.810
And so you could take as much
of it as you wanted.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.750
Here it's as if you
had gold bricks.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:36.210
You get to take the whole brick
or no brick at all.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:41.610
Each item has a weight and a
value, and we're trying to

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.240
optimize it as before.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.880
So let's look at an example of
a zero-one knapsack problem.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.630
Again we'll go back
to our burglar.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:31:01.100
So the burglar breaks into the
house and finds the following

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.300
items available.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.380
And you'll see in your handout
a list of items and their

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.250
value and how much,
what they weight.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:13.830
Finds a watch, a nice Bose
radio, a beautiful Tiffany

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:19.890
vase, and a large
velvet Elvis.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:23.510
And now this burglar finds, in
fact, two of each of those.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.430
Person is a real velvet Elvis
fan and needed two

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.940
copies of this one.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.130
Alright, and now he's trying
to decide what to take.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.280
Well if the knapsack were large
enough the thief would

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.890
take it all and run, but let's
assume that it can only hold

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.340
eight pounds, as before.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.630
And therefore the thief
has choices to make.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.990
Well, there are three types of
thieves I want to consider:

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:57.570
the greedy thief, the
slow thief, and you.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.420
We'll start with the
greedy thief.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.300
Well, the greedy thief follows
the greedy algorithm.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.150
What do you get if you follow
the greedy algorithm?

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.400
What's the first thing
the thief does?

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:14.720
Takes the most valuable item,
which is a watch.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.110
And then what does
he do after that?

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.570
Takes another watch.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.540
And then?

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:22.900
Pardon?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.330
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:24.890
PROFESSOR: And then?

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.740
PROFESSOR: No.

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.240
Not unless he wants to break
the vase into little pieces

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.430
and stuff it in the corners.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.340
The backpack is now
full, right?

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.660
There's no more room.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:45.590
So the greedy thief take
that and leaves.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:52.420
But it's not an optimal
solution.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.730
What should the thief
have done?

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.860
What's the best thing
you can do?

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.420
Instead of taking that
one vase, the thief

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.890
could take two radios.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.710
And get more value.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:12.300
So the greedy thief, in some
sense, gets the wrong answer.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:16.020
But maybe isn't so dumb.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.070
While greedy algorithms are not
guaranteed to get you the

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.080
right answer all the
time, they're often

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.350
very good to use.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:31.190
And what they're good about is,
they're easy to implement.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.380
And they're fast to run.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.980
You can imagine coding
the solution up

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.860
and it's pretty easy.

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.890
And when it runs, it's pretty
fast. Just takes the most

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.570
valuable, the next most
valuable, the next most

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.390
valuable, I'm done.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:51.000
And the thief leaves,
and is gone.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.400
So that's a good thing.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.460
On the other hand, it's often
the case in the world that

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.300
that's not good enough.

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.990
And we're not looking for an OK
solution, but we're looking

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.280
for the best solution.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:11.440
Optimal means best. And that's
what the slow thief does.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.450
So the slow thief thinks
the following.

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:18.070
Well, what I'll do is I'll
put stuff in the

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.480
backpack until it's full.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.710
I'll compute its value.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.250
Then I'll empty the backpack
out, put another combination

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.170
of stuff compute its value,
try all possible ways of

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.370
filling up the backpack, and
then when I'm done, I'll know

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.200
which was the best. And that's
the one I'll do.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.690
So he's packing and unpacking,
packing and unpacking, trying

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.900
all possible combinations of
objects that will obey the

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.950
constraint.

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:51.140
And then choosing the winner.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.530
Well, this is like an algorithm
we've seen before.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.780
It's not greedy.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.820
What is this?

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.820
What category of algorithm
is that?

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.970
Somebody?

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.420
Louder?

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.150
STUDENT: Brute force.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.530
PROFESSOR: Brute force,
exhaustive

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.410
enumeration, exactly.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.780
We're exhausting all
possibilities.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.490
And then choosing the winner.

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.240
Well, that's what the
slow thief tried.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.240
Unfortunately it took so long
that before he finished the

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.770
owner returned home, called the
police and the thief ended

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.860
up in jail.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.880
It happens.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.890
Fortunately, while sitting in
jail awaiting trial, the slow

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.350
thief decided to figure
what was wrong.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:37.650
And, amazingly enough, he
had studied mathematics.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.520
And had a blackboard
in the cell.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.810
So he was able to work it out.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:47.130
So he first said, well, let me
try and figure out what I was

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.700
really doing and why
it took so long.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.860
So first, let's think about what
was the function the slow

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:02.930
thief was attempting
to maximize.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:10.160
The summation, from i equals 1
to n, where n is the number of

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:20.610
items, so I might label watch
1-0, watch 2-2, I don't care

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:21.650
that they're both watches.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.600
They're two separate items.
And then what I want to

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:34.360
maximize is the sum of the price
of item i times whether

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:40.400
or not I took x i.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:51.090
So think of x as a vector
of 0's and 1's.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.130
Hence the name of the problem.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.500
If I'm going to keep that item,
item i, if I'm going to

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.740
take it, I give it a 1.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:03.800
If I'm not going to take
it I give it a 0.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.140
And so I just take the value of
that item times whether or

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.000
not it's 0 or 1.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:19.840
So my goal here is to choose x
such that this is maximized.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:25.240
Choose x such that that function
is maximized, subject

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.660
to a constraint.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:48.020
And the constraint, is it the
sum from 1 to n of the weight

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:57.950
of the item, times x i, is less
than or equal to c, the

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.760
maximum weight I'm allowed
to put in my backpack.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.810
In this case it was eight.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.600
So now I have a nice, tidy
mathematical formulation of

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.380
the problem.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.490
And that's often the first step
in problem reduction.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.560
Is to go from a problem that has
a bunch of words, and try

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.450
and write it down as a nice,
tight mathematical

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:23.100
formulation.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:28.190
So now I know the formulation
is to find x, the vector x,

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.410
such that this constraint
is obeyed and

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:37.610
this function is maximized.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:38.680
That make sense to everybody?

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.730
Any questions about that?

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.720
Great.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.220
So as the thief had thought,
we can clearly solve this

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:57.270
problem by generating all
possible values of x and

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:03.990
seeing which one solves
this problem.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:06.720
But now the thief started
scratching his head and said,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:13.450
well, how many possible
values of x are there?

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:19.670
Well, how can we think
about that?

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:23.450
Well, a nice way to think
about that is to

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:25.990
say, I've got a vector.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:32.460
So there's the vector with
eight 0's in it.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.140
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:44.120
Indicating I didn't take
any of the items.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.610
There's the vector, and again
you'll see this in your

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:55.610
handout, says I only took
the first item.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.330
There's the one that says I
only took the second item.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.590
There's the one that says
I took the first

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.330
and the second item.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:09.140
And at the last,
I have all 1's.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.870
This series look like anything
familiar to you?

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.050
These are binary
numbers, right?

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:16.380
Eight digit binary numbers.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:21.010
Zero, one, two, three.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:23.030
What's the biggest number
I can represent

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.260
with eight of these?

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.350
Somebody?

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.450
Well, suppose we had
decimal numbers.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.040
And I said I'm giving you
three decimal digits.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.870
What's the biggest number you
can represent with three

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.650
decimal digits?

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:43.970
Pardon?

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:45.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.140
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.670
Which is roughly what?

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:51.420
10 to the?

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:55.020
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:58.390
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.760
Yes.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:01.930
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.400
Exactly right.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.060
So, in this case it's
2 to the 8th.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.890
Because I have eight digits.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.270
But exactly right.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:18.670
More generally, it's
2 to the n.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.910
Where n is the number of
possible items I have to

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:26.460
choose from.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:33.550
Well, now that we've figured
that out, what we're seeing is

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:42.600
that the brute force algorithm
is exponential.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.640
In the number of items we
have to choose from.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.380
Not in the number that we take,
but the number we have

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.330
to think about taking.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:57.120
Exponential growth
is a scary thing.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:01.390
So now we can look at
these two graphs,

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:03.490
look at the top one.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:10.630
So there, we've compared n
squared, quadratic growth,

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:15.650
which by the way Professor
Grimson told you was bad, to,

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.180
really bad, which is
exponential growth.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.870
And in fact, if you look at
the top figure it looks as

00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:27.570
exponential or, quadratic isn't
even growing at all.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:31.090
You see how really fast
exponential growth is?

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.660
You get to fifteen items and
we're up at seventy thousand

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:39.150
already and counting.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.840
The bottom graph has exactly
the same data.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.040
But what I've done is, I've use
the logarithmic y-axis.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.930
Later in the term, we'll spend
quite a lot of time talking

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.130
about how do we visualize
data.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.220
How do we make sense of data.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.270
I've done that because you can
see here that the quadratic

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.890
one is actually growing.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:05.400
It's just growing a
lot more slowly.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.700
So the moral here
is simple one.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:15.910
Exponential algorithms are
typically not useful. n does

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:21.470
not have to get very big for
exponential to fail.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:24.150
Now, imagine that you're trying
to pack a ship and

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:27.780
you've got ten thousand
items to choose from.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:34.790
2 to the 10,000 is a
really big number.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:39.190
So what we see immediately,
and the slow thief decided

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:44.500
just before being incarcerated
for years and years, was that

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.090
it wasn't possible to
do it that way.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:51.210
He threw up his hands and
said, it's an unsolvable

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:52.860
problem, I should have been
greedy, there's no

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.320
good way to do this.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.320
That gets us to the
smart thief.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.780
Why is this thief smart?

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.100
Because she took 600.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.640
And she learned that in fact
there is a good way to solve

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.200
this problem.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.660
And that's what we're going
to talk about next.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:23.060
And that's something called
dynamic programming.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.150
A lot of people think this is
a really hard and fancy

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.770
concept, and they teach in
advanced algorithms classes.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.810
And they do, but in fact
as you'll see it's

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.730
really pretty simple.

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:35.810
A word of warning.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.290
Don't try and figure out
why it's called dynamic

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:39.380
programming.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.800
It makes no sense at all.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:45.880
It was invented by a
mathematician called Bellman.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.370
And he was at the time being
paid by the Defense Department

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.830
to work on something else.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:54.090
And he didn't want them to
know what he was doing.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.250
So he made up a name that he
was sure they would have no

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.820
clue what it meant.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:02.240
Unfortunately, we now have
lived with it forever, so

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.660
don't think of it as actually
being anything dynamic

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.850
particularly.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.870
It's just a name.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.330
It's very useful, and why we
spend time on it for solving a

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:18.260
broad range of problems that
on their surface are

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.870
exponentially difficult.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:25.530
And, in fact, getting very
fast solutions to them.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.300
The key thing in dynamic
programming, and we'll return

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:32.100
to both of these, is you're
looking for a situation where

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:45.280
there are overlapping
sub-problems and what's called

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.590
optimal substructure.

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.620
Don't expect to know what
these mean yet.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.750
Hopefully by the end of the day,
Tuesday, they will both

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.220
make great sense to you.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.920
Let's first look at
the overlapping

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.760
sub-problems example.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.120
You have on your handout,
a recursive

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:07.640
implementation of Fibonacci.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:25.830
Which we've seen before.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.840
What I've done is I've augmented
it with this global

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.560
called num calls just so I can
keep track of how many times

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.920
it gets called.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:48.930
And let's see what happens
if we call fib of 5.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:53.650
Well, quite a few steps.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:47:00.710
What's the thing that you notice
about this output?

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.770
There's something here that
should tip us off that maybe

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:09.080
we're not doing this the most
efficient way possible.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:15.040
I called fib with 5 and then
it calls it with 4.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.870
And then that call
calls fib with 3.

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:21.420
So I'm doing 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.800
And I'm doing 1, 2.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.180
Well, what we see is I'm calling
fib a lot of times

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.760
with the same argument.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:31.800
And it makes sense.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.200
Because I start with fib of 5,
and then I have to do fib of 4

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.510
and fib of 3.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.940
Well, fib of 4 is going to also
have to do a fib of 3 and

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:46.210
a fib of 2 and a fib of
1, and a fib of 0.

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:49.220
And then the fib of 3 is going
to do a fib of 2 and a fib of

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.150
1 and a fib of 0.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:56.120
And so I'm doing the same thing
over and over again.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.420
That's because I have what
are called overlapping

00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:04.630
sub-problems. I have used divide
and conquer, as we seen

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.670
before, to recursively break it
into smaller problems. But

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.850
the smaller problem of fib of
4 and the smaller problem of

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.740
fib of 3 overlap with
each other.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.210
And that leads to a lot of
redundant computation.

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.680
And I've done fib of 5, which
is a small number.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.120
If we look at some other things,
for example, let's get

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:39.860
rid of this.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:56.590
Let's try see fib of 10.

00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:02.590
Well, there's a reason I chose
10 rather than, say, 20.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:09.420
Here fib got called 177 times.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:13.280
Roughly speaking, the analysis
of fib is actually quite

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.020
complex, of a recursive fib.

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:18.290
And I won't go through it, but
what you can see is it's more

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.680
or less, it is in fact,
exponential.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.840
But it's not 2 to
the something.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.950
It's a more complicated thing.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.370
But it grows quite quickly.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:34.240
And the reason it does is
because of this overlapping.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.750
On Tuesday we'll talk about a
different way to implement

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:44.510
Fibonacci, where the growth will
be much less dramatic.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.030
Thank you.
