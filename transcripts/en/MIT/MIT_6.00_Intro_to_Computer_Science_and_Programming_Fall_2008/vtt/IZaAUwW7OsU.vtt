00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.090
PROFESSOR: So you may recall
that, in the last lecture, we

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.220
more or less solved the drunken
student problem,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.050
looking at a random walk.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.510
I now want to move on and
discuss some variants of the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.230
random walk problem that are
collectively known as biased

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:53.260
random walks.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.950
So the notion here is, the walk
is still stochastic but

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.230
there is some bias in the
direction, so the movements

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.500
are not uniformly distributed or
equally distributed in all

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.560
directions.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.940
As I go through this, I want
you to sort of, think in

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.520
advance about what the take-home
message should be.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.740
One, and this is probably the
most important part for today,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.560
is I want to illustrate how by
designing our programs in a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.670
nice way around classes, we
can change them to do

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.430
something else writing a
minimal amount of code.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.180
And the idea here is that
classes are not there just to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.950
provide some syntax that makes
life complicated, but to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.050
actually provide a mechanism
that lets us structure our

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.380
programs in a way that we
can modify them later.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.670
I also want to give you a bit
more experience looking at

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.820
data, and understanding how,
when you get the results of a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.000
simulation or anything else that
provides you with data,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.720
you can plot, them study the
plots, and try and use those

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.460
to develop an understanding
about what's going on.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.860
And finally, I want to just get
you thinking more about

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.560
random behavior.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.080
Because we're going to talk a
lot more this semester and in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.300
general throughout your careers,
you'll see a lot of

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.530
uses of stochastic things.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.280
All right, so let's think about
these biased walks.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.610
So for example, assume that
the drunk grew up in South

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.440
Florida, and really hates
the New England winter.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.730
Well there might be a bias that
even though the drunk is

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.940
not in total control, she's kind
of wandering southward.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.380
So there's a bias when taking a
step to more likely go south

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.400
than certainly north.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.160
Or imagine that the drunk is
photosensitive and moves

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.030
either towards the sun
or away from the sun,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.410
or some such thing.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.910
So we're going to look at
different things of that

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.970
nature and think about, I'll
come back to Chutes and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.390
Ladders later in the lecture,
you can speculate

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.210
on why this is here.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.540
And we'll look at that.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.910
So, this is on the front page
of your handout here.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.560
I've taken the random walk
program we looked at last time

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.370
and changed it a bit.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.210
And in particular,
I've changed the

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.430
way the drunk works.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.170
So let's look at the code.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.570
Wow, haven't even done
anything it's --

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:07.220
see how this works.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.030
So now, drunk itself is a very
small class, one I don't

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.410
actually intend to
ever instantiate.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.880
I've pared it down, it has
only two methods in it.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.890
It has an init, which is the
same as before, and a move

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.150
which is the same as before,
almost the same.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.090
Now I'm going to have the
class usual drunk.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.900
That's the drunk we looked
at the last time.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.780
And this usual drunk will behave
just like the drunk we

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.570
looked at last time.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.260
In here, I'm going to override
the move method of the

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.770
inherited superclass, and what
this is going to do is, it's

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.380
going to make the same random
choice it made before and then

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.580
it's going to call drunk
dot move with

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.420
the new compass point.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.230
So all I've done is, I've taken
a couple of lines of

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.380
code out of the previous
implementation and moved it to

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.390
the subclass.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.540
So it's now, excuse me, in the
subclass I'm making the

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.400
decision about which
direction to move.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.540
Once I've made that decision,
then I can call the drunk in

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.360
the superclass.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:47.930
Notice here, when I've made
the call, drunk dot move.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.640
So usually you're expecting
me to write

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.610
something like d dot move.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.930
The object.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.170
Here, instead I'm specifying
which class to get the move

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:07.710
from, So this is saying, don't
call my local move, call the

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.670
move from the superclass.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.410
There are a number of other
syntaxes I could've used to

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.350
accomplish the same thing.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:24.830
I used this because it seemed
the most straightforward.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.960
Now let's compare the usual
drunk to the cold drunk.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.560
So the cold drunk, again, I've
overridden the move, and now

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.810
it does something different.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.730
It gets the random compass point
as before, but if it

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.420
happens to be south, it
calls drunk dot move

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.500
with twice the distance.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:59.070
So whenever I get the notion
I'm moving south, because I

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.210
love the warmth, I actually move
twice as fast. So instead

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.100
of taking one step, which I do
to the other compass points,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.360
if I happen to be going south
I'll take two steps.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.830
So I'm biased towards
moving southward.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.640
And then I call drunk
dot move.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.340
Otherwise, I call drunk
dot move with

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.540
the distances before.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.800
So I've isolated into the
subclass this notion of being

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.060
heat-seeking.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.170
We've got a third sub class,
ew drunk, known

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:47.100
for east west drunk.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.160
And here, what I've done is, I
choose to compass point and

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.200
then while it's not either east
or west, I choose again.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.790
So this drunk can only move
eastward or westward.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:07.810
Can't move north or south.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:12.790
So again you'll see I'm able to
have three kinds of drunks.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.550
Who as we will see, exhibit
rather different behavior from

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:25.650
each other with a minimal amount
of change to the code.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:33.880
If we look down at the bottom,
we'll see that the code is

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.540
pretty much exactly what
it was last time.

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.340
By the way, this doesn't
quite match the

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.970
code in your handout.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.230
I decided to make the plots
a little bit prettier with

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.550
better titles and things, but
when I tried to put these in

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.740
your handouts it wouldn't fit.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.360
So I have a little more compact
things, but this is, I

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.630
think, a better way
to write it.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.520
But essentially, perform trial,
perform sim, answer

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.940
quest, are all identical to
what they were before.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.850
So because I structured my
program in such a way that the

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.620
drunk's behavior was independent
of all the code

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.420
for the generating the trials
and plotting the results, I

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.920
didn't have to change
any of that.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.680
And this is the key
to good design.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.270
Is to isolate decisions in small
parts of your program,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.650
so when as inevitable happens,
you want to enhance the

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.860
program, or you discover you've
done something wrong,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:48.100
the number changes you
make is not large.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.290
OK, one thing we do need to look
at down here is, it's not

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.550
quite the same as before,
because we'll see that there's

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:06.240
an extra parameter to these
things called drunk type.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.940
So if we start with answer
question, it takes as before,

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.700
the time, the number of trials,
a title, and this one

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.960
extra thing called
the drunk type.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.620
And then when it goes on and
it calls perform sim, it

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.310
passes the drunk type.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:38.710
And this is the key line here.

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.690
Before, you may recall
we just said d equals

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.340
drunk with the arguments.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:51.730
Here, I say d equals
drunk type.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.650
So what is drunk type?

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.710
Drunk type is itself a type.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.350
We can use types, you know
variables can have as their

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.610
values types, parameters can
have as their values types.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.630
So I'm just passing the type
around so that here, when it

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.160
comes time to get a drunk,
I get a drunk of

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.620
the appropriate type.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.110
So I can now answer the question
about a usual drunk,

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:31.700
or a cold drunk,
or a ew drunk.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.880
This is very common kind of
programming paradigm.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.430
We've talked about it before,
but this is yet another

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.500
example of how we use
polymorphism.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.950
Polymorphism.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.470
We write our code in such a way
that it works with many

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.950
types of objects.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.740
Here we're writing code
that will work with

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.630
any subtype of drunk.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.170
Now I'd better not
pass it a float.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.230
You know, if I answer quest, and
instead of something like

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.360
usual drunk or cold drunk or e
w drunk, I pass it float or

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.560
int, the world will come
crashing down around my head.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.720
But I haven't, so you'll see
down here, I pass it num

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.130
steps, number trials,
and usual drunk.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.530
Which is the name of?

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.050
A class.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.760
Any questions about this?

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.160
Yes?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:45.360
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.330
PROFESSOR: Louder, please?

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:53.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.950
PROFESSOR: Good,
good question.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.250
The question is, does a drunk
type make a new drunk?

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.630
Now, I have so much candy to
choose from, I don't know what

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.470
to throw you.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.670
Do you like Tootsie Rolls,
Snickers, Tootsie Roll Pops,

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.220
Dots, what's your choice?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:19.370
Snickers.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.040
OK, so what is it?

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:29.970
Down here nothing is created
when that call was made.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.180
It was if I had typed the
word float or int.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:41.460
I'm merely saying, here is a
type, and the parameter should

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.860
now be bound to that type.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.680
Now any time you use the
parameter, it's just as if you

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.240
had written the string, in
this case, usual drunk.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:08.790
So when I get up to here, think
about, it will take, the

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:19.610
variable drunk type, evaluate
it, it will evaluate to a type

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.040
usual drunk, say, in
the first call.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.040
And then it will, just as if
I had written usual drunk,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:34.430
invoke the init method of drunk,
and create a new drunk,

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.890
but this drunk will be
of type usual drunk

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:40.300
rather than a drunk.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.970
Does that make sense?

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:50.320
All right, so this avoids my
having to write a whole bunch

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.590
of tests, I could have passed
a string, and said if the

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.140
string said usual drunk, then
d equals something.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.860
But here instead of
that, I'm actually

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:07.330
passing the type itself.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.710
OK?

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.300
So other than the fact that I
have to pass the type around,

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.570
this is exactly the
same as before.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:26.150
Now just for fun, we saw that
last time when I asked you

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.100
what did usual drunk do, there
was some confusion.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.410
Not confusion, just a bad guess
about how the drunk

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.950
would wander.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.950
So, let's try it again.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:44.490
What do you think about
the cold drunk?

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.850
Will the cold drunk get further
from the origin than

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.740
the usual drunk?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:51.880
Not further from the origin?

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.450
Who thinks the cold drunk
will be further away

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:56.710
the end of 500 steps?

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:01.610
Who thinks the cold drunk will
not be further away?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.590
And I'll bet we can all agr --
got that right, I think -- and

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.470
I'll bet you'll all agree that,
with higher probability,

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.870
the cold drunk will be south
of the origin than north of

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.520
the origin.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.440
More interesting, how
about the ew drunk?

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:24.120
So this is a drunk that only
goes east or west, east or

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:31.950
west. Will this drunk, well,
first of all, what's the

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.280
expected distance?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.880
Do you think it should
be close to zero or

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.560
not close to zero?

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.180
Who thinks it should
be close to 0?

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.780
Who thinks it won't
be close to 0?

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.370
Well you guys have all fallen
for the same trick you fell

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.530
for last time.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.510
Fooled you twice.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.230
Be careful, one more
and you're out.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.560
As we'll see.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.770
But it's interesting.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:12.680
So let's run this program
and see what happens.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.590
I can take a just a second
or two and we should

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:22.470
get a bunch of plots.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.710
All right, so here's
the usual drunk.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:33.050
100 trials and just as before,
wandered away.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.440
Moderately smooth, but of course
little ups and downs,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.990
maybe suggesting averaging
over 100 trials

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.230
is not quite enough.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.920
I felt a little better if it
were smoother, but the trend

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:52.970
is pretty clear here, I think
we probably don't doubt it.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.530
Well, look at cold drunk.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.520
Like a shot heading south.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.930
So here we see, there's bias,
that if you get south you go

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.670
twice as far makes a
huge difference.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.450
Instead of being roughly 20
steps away, it's roughly 120

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.550
steps away.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:21.500
So we see, and this is something
to think about, a

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.520
small bias can end up making a
huge difference over time.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.230
This is why casinos
do so well.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.370
They don't have to have a very
much of a bias in their favor

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.640
on each roll of the dice in
order to accumulate a lot of

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.410
money over time.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:43.040
It's why if you just weigh your
dice a little bit, so

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.020
that they're not fair, you'll
do very very well.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.100
I'm not recommending that.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.220
Kind of interesting.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.680
The e w drunk is pretty much the
same distance away as the

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.440
usual drunk.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.090
This is why we run these
simulations, is because we

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:10.780
learn things.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.920
Now, I have to confess,
it fooled me, too.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.570
The first time I ran this, I
looked at this and said, wait

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.800
a minute, that's not
what I expected.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.610
So I scratched my head, and
thought about, all right, why

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.770
is it behaving this way?

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.260
This happens me a lot in my own
research, that I crunch

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.950
some data, do some plots, look
at it, get surprised, and on

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.100
the basis of that I learned
something about the underlying

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.960
system I'm modeling.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.910
Because it provokes me to
think in ways I had not

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.510
thought before I saw the data.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.900
This is an important lesson.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.740
You don't ignore the data, you
try and explain the data.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.200
So when I thought about what
happened, I realize that while

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.290
I might have started at the
origin, and after the first

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:07.950
step I'm equally likely
to be here or here.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:17.260
Once I've taken the first step,
now my expected location

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.600
is not zero, right?

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.580
The first step, my expected
location was zero.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.550
Because equally likely to
be plus 1 or minus 1.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:34.810
But once I've taken a step and
I happen to be here, my

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:40.820
expected location, if I'm here,
is plus 1, it's not 0.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.630
Because half the time I'll get
back to 0, but half the time

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.100
I'll get to 2.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:55.100
So once I have moved away from
where I've started, the

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:03.160
expectation of where I'll
end up has changed.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.880
This is kind of a profound thing
to think about, because

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.090
when we look at it, this kind of
behavior explains a lot of

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.820
surprising results in life.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:21.620
Where, if you get a small run of
random events that take you

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:28.170
far from where you started,
it's hard to get back.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:32.160
So if you think about the stock
market, for example, if

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.420
you happen to get unlucky and
have a few days or weeks or

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.490
months, as the case may be,
where you get a run of bad

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.910
days, it's really hard to get
back if all the movements

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:46.770
after that are random.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.710
Because you've established
a new baseline.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.240
And as we'll see later, when
you start doing things at

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.740
random, it's likely you'll get a
few runs in one direction or

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.940
another, and then you've got
a new baseline, and it's

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.960
unlikely to get back to where
you were originally.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.200
We'll see a lot of
examples of this.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:13.530
But that's what's happening
here, and that's why it looks

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.140
the way it does.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.450
That makes sense to people?

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.430
Well, so I had this theory,
as I often do when I have

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.650
theories, I don't believe them,
so I decided I better

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:34.120
write some more code
to check it out.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:40.020
So, what I did is, I took the
previous simulation and now

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:43.330
instead of looking at different
kinds of drunks, I

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.990
got more aggressive in
thinking about my

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.440
analysis of the data.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.590
So again, there's
a lesson here.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:58.900
I decided I wanted to analyze
my data in new ways.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.160
And the beauty of it was, I
could do that without changing

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.912
either any of the code about the
drunk, or any they of the

00:23:07.912 --> 00:23:10.970
code about performing the
simulation, really.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.890
All I had to do was do a
different kind of analysis to

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.250
a first approximation.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:26.170
So, let's look at what
I've done here.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.990
What I've decided to do here is
not only plot, and again, I

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:37.830
think you'll see this code, not
only plot how far from the

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:44.300
origin the drunk is over time,
but I'm going to actually plot

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.870
two other things.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.880
I'm going to use a scatter plot,
I think I use scatter in

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.870
this one, I do, to show
where the drunk is at

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.070
each period of time.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.700
Actually, just all the
places the drunk

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.880
ends up in each trial.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.980
This will give me a visualized
way just see, OK, in my, say,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.860
100 trials, how many the drunk
ended up near the origin, how

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.160
many of them ended up
really far away?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.240
And just, allow me to visualize
what's going on.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.390
And then I'm going to also use
a histogram to sort of

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.400
summarize some things.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:34.430
To get a look at the
distribution of the data.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.620
We've been just looking at
average results, but it's

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.610
often the case that the average
does not really tell

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.190
the whole story.

00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:46.490
You want to ask, well, how many
of the drunks ended up

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.930
really far away?

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.830
How many of the drunks ended
up where they started?

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.780
You can't tell that
from the averages.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.860
So you use a distribution, which
tells you information

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.500
about how many people
ended up where.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.400
So we again saw that, in a less
pleasant context, maybe,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.910
in looking at the quizzes,
remember I sent you some plots

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.470
about the quizzes, and
I didn't just say,

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.320
here was the average.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:20.750
I showed you the distribution
of grades.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.970
That allowed you to see, not
only where you were relative

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.360
to the average, but whether
you were an outlier.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.160
Was your grade much better
than the average?

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.980
Or were there a whole bunch of
people around where you are?

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.090
So there's a lot of information
there, that will

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.280
help us understand what's
really going on.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.940
So we'll run this now.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:48.440
Again, there's nothing very
interesting here about how I

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.200
did it, I just used some of
these Pylab dot hist, which

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.890
gives me a histogram, Pylab dot
scatter, which gives me a

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.970
scatter plot.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.350
I'll take 500 steps,
400 trials.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.600
I've done some more trials here,
so we get some smoother

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.370
lines, better distributions.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.140
And then I'm going to look at
the usual drunk and ew drunk

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:24.790
only, just to save some time.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:31.220
At least I think I am.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.280
My computer runs faster
when it's plugged in.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.040
All right, but we have
our figures here,

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.360
let's look at them.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.960
So here's figure one,
the usual drunk.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.880
Well, all right, as we've
seen this 1000

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.680
times, or at least six.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:55.000
So doing what it usually
does, not quite 20.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.820
This is kind of interesting.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.540
This is the final locations
of the 400 trials

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.340
of the usual drunk.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.990
So we see some information here,
that we really couldn't

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.000
get from the averages.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.560
That there are more of these
points near the middle, but

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.200
there are certainly plenty
scattered around.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.880
And we get to see that, they're
pretty much symmetric

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.760
around where we started.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.770
This is what we would
have hoped, right?

00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.000
If we had looked at it, and we
had seen all the points up

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.250
here, or most of them up here,
we would have said, wait a

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.190
minute, there's something
wrong with my code.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.550
This was supposed to not
be a biased walk,

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.620
but an unbiased walk.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.580
And if I'd seen a bias in this
population, I should have

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.180
gotten nervous that I had
some problems with my

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.760
implementation.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.270
My simulation.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.920
So in addition to helping me
understand results, this gives

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.540
me some confidence that I really
am doing an unbiased

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.080
walk, right?

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.820
Some over here, some
over here.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.000
Not exactly the same, but
close enough that I feel

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:19.350
pretty comfortable.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:25.020
And if I look at the
distribution, which probably I

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.930
could've if I worked really
hard, gotten from the scatter

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:34.880
plot, but I really didn't want
to, we'll see that most of the

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.750
drunks actually do end up pretty
close to the origin.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.960
But that there are a few that
are pretty far away.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.960
And again, it's close to
symmetric around zero.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.590
Which gives me a good feeling
that things are working the

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.520
way they should.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:00.100
This, by the way, is what's
called a normal distribution.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:04.210
Because once upon a time, people
believed this was the

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.850
way things usually happened.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:16.030
This is called either
normal or Gaussian.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.620
The mathematician Gauss was
one of the first people to

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.870
write about this distribution.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.320
We'll come back to this later,
and among other things, we'll

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.770
try and see whether normal
is really normal.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.960
But you see it a lot of times.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.410
And basically what it says is
that most of the values hang

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.360
out around the average,
the middle.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.190
And there are a few outliers,
and as we get further and

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:49.260
further out, fewer and
fewer points occur.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.120
So you'll see these kind of
curves, of distributions,

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.390
occurring a lot.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:56.680
Again, we'll come back to
distributions in a week, or

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.810
actually in a lecture or two.

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:03.690
See a little bit more today,
and then more later on.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:13.800
All right, here's our east west
drunk, again as before,

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:18.470
drifting off to around 18.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.730
Well, look at these dots.

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:26.820
Well, this makes me feel, that
at least I know that the drunk

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.250
is only moving east and west.
And again you'll see, pretty

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:35.640
dense in the middle and
a few outliers.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.730
Managed to get a little further
east than west, but

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:41.520
that happens.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:47.390
East is always more
attractive.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.810
What we might have guessed.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:56.410
And if we look at the
distribution, again we can

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:59.480
look at it, and I'm just giving
you the east west

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:07.160
values here, and again
it's about the same.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.940
So, what do I want you to take
away from these graphs?

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.680
Different plots show you
different things.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.190
So I'm not going to try and
claim that of these three

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.170
different plots we did, one
is the right one to do.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.000
What I'm going to assert
is that you want

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.930
to do all of them.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.280
Try and visualize the data
in multiple ways.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.810
And sometimes it's much easier
to, even if different plots

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:41.240
contain exactly the same
information, and in some sense

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.500
of the scatter plot and the
histogram do contain exactly

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.320
the same information.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.580
In fact, there's more
information in the scatter

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.630
plot, in some sense, because I
see each one individually.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:57.520
But it's, for me, a
lot harder to see.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.090
If I'd ask you from the
scatter plot, are they

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.560
normally distributed?

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.920
You might have had a hard
time answering it.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.180
Particularly for the usual
drunk, where you just saw a

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.760
lot of points.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:13.340
So the idea of some summarizing
it in the

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:18.680
histogram makes it much easier
to make sense of the data, and

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.600
see what you're doing, and to
try and learn the lesson

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:32.260
you're trying to learn.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:37.560
OK, this makes sense
to people?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.700
All right, let's move on.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:48.040
Now we'll go back to this lovely
picture we had before.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.380
Any of you ever play the game
Chutes and Ladders?

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.050
Raise your hand?

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:57.790
OK, some things never
go out of style.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:04.070
Well, imagine your poor drunk
wandering through this board,

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:09.430
and every once in a while,
because I'm kind of a, not a

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.620
nice person, I've eliminated all
the ladders, and have only

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:13.220
some chutes.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.980
And every once in a while
the drunk hits a

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.770
chute and goes whoosh.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:26.560
And in fact, let's, for the
sake of simplicity here,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:32.230
assume that the chutes are
going to, every once in a

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.970
while, the drunk will hit a bad
spot, and go right back to

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.300
the origin.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.470
So this poor, say, heat-seeking
drunk who's

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:44.260
trying to head south, does it
for a while and maybe gets

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.230
zipped right back to where
he or she started.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.440
All right, I've now told
you I want to put

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.740
some, make this happen.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.900
What part of the code do you
think I should change?

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.400
Somebody?

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.090
STUDENT: The field.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:11.360
PROFESSOR: The field,
absolutely.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.280
Those are good to throw
short distances.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:17.760
The field, right, because what
we're talking about here is

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.420
not a property of the drunk,
or a property of the

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:26.120
simulation, but a property of
the space in which the drunk

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:30.000
is wandering.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.210
So again, we see that by
structuring the initial

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.370
program around the natural
abstractions that occur in the

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:46.470
problem, natural kinds of
changes can be localized.

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:52.860
So let's go and change
the field.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.570
So I'm going to have the field
I had before plus this thing

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:03.140
called an odd field.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.850
Odd field will be a
subclass of field.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.790
This is not odd as in
odd or even, this

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:12.770
is odd as in strange.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:19.850
So I'm going to first define
where my chutes are.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:29.540
So is chute will take, will
get the coordinates, and

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.650
assign it to x and y, so it
gets the coordinates of a

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:37.220
place, and then will return
abs x minus abs

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.680
y is equal to zero.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:45.780
So, where are my chutes
going to occur?

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:53.980
Somebody?

00:35:53.980 --> 00:36:00.130
Yeah, kind of radiating
out from the origin.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:06.720
Any place, so I'll have
my origin, here.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.200
Got my graph.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:13.860
And all along here, any place
x and y are equal,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:18.180
there'll be a chute.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.590
Now, I have to be a little bit
careful that it doesn't happen

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:27.110
here, or we won't
get anywhere.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:32.400
So, and then move, in odd field,
will call field dot

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.530
move, which is unchanged from
what it was before.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:43.130
And then it will say, if self
dot is chute, set the location

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.690
back to 0,0.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:50.120
So the poor drunk will move as
before, and if he or she hits

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:58.220
this wormhole, get instantly
teleported back to the origin.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.910
Very small change, but it will
give us rather different

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:08.410
behaviors, at least
I think it will.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:17.460
And then if we look at how we
use it, not much changes.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.670
Except, what do you think is
going to have to change?

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.420
Where will I have to make
the change, somebody?

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:27.840
You can actually see
the code here.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.710
I'll have to get a different
field, right?

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:35.880
So, at the place where I
instantiate a field, instead

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.600
of instantiating a field, I'll
instantiate an odd field.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.130
Now if I'd had 16 different
kinds of odd fields, or even

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:49.500
two, I might well have done
what I did with drunk.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.860
But in order to sort of minimize
things, I've done

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.040
something much smaller.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.400
So let's see, where did
we get the field?

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.780
I don't even remember.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.140
So, here's what I do when I'm
looking at my program and I

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.530
want to see where
something is.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:13.090
I use the text editor, and I'm
going to search for it.

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:24.500
Let's see.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:31.320
Well, it's not there.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.710
There it is.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:37.280
So here when I get my field, I
get my drunk, and then I get a

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:44.280
field which is an odd field.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.460
All right, anyone want to
speculate what will happen

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:54.170
when I run this one?

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:59.150
Think the drunk will be closer
or further from the origin

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.870
when we're done?

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:03.050
Who thinks closer?

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.120
Who thinks further?

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.720
Who thinks no difference?

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.920
Well, you're right, I mean it's
sort of logical if we

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.180
think about it, that if every
once in a while you get to

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.220
zipped, back it's going to be
harder to get further away.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.890
We'll see different behaviors,
by the way, it depends on the

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.200
drunk, right?

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.832
That's true for the usual drunk,
but maybe not for the

00:39:23.832 --> 00:39:27.740
east west drunk.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.590
We can see what happens.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.900
So let's try some.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.030
We'll do it for the usual
drunk, which is the more

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:58.030
interesting case
to start with.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.670
So you'll see whereas before we
were up just shy of 20 most

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:06.140
of the time, here we don't get
very much much, further.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:13.040
We do get steadily further,
but at a lot slower pace.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.220
What do you think it means that,
before you remember, we

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:17.830
saw a pretty smooth line.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.200
Here we see what may look you
like a fat line, but is in

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.660
fact a line with a lot
of wiggles in it.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:30.680
What does that imply, about
what's going on in the

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:36.430
simulation, the fact that line
is jagged rather than smooth

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:41.490
as it was before?

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.390
Pardon?

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:44.070
Can't hear you?

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:44.470
STUDENT: That it jumps.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:50.320
PROFESSOR: Well, certainly it
happens because of the jumps,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.680
but what else is going on?

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.910
But what is it, sort of, imply
more, whoa, sorry about that,

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.410
more generally?

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.190
Right, what it's saying, is
that because of the jumps,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:07.190
there's a lot more variation
from trial to trial.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.860
Not surprising, right, because
you sometimes you hit these

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.480
wormholes and sometimes
you don't.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:15.330
So let's look at this
other figure.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.460
This is kind of interesting.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:24.090
So here's the scatter plot.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:37.070
And if we zoom in on it, what
we see here is, there are

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.710
essentially holes, you
know, these alleys

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:46.410
where no points lie.

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:50.380
Just as we might have
guessed from here.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.940
The only way you would get a
point lying on these alleys,

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.640
if it happened to be the very
last step of the simulation,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.740
not even then, because the last
thing we do is go back to

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.540
the origin.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.840
So we can look at this, and say,
well, sure enough, this

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:15.790
is keeping people off of a
certain part of the field.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.110
All right, some of you will be
happy to know we are, for the

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.590
moment, actually maybe for the
whole rest of the term,

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.010
leaving the notion of drunks.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.880
Though not of random walks.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:30.260
All right, any questions about
what's going on here?

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.970
And again, I would urge you to
sort of study the code and the

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.910
way it's been factored to
accomplish these things.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.370
And play with it, and look
at what you get from the

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.870
different plots.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.620
I now want to pull back from
this specific example, and

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:50.310
spend a few minutes talking
about simulation in general.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:55.720
Computer simulation really grew
hand in hand with the

00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.400
development of the computers,
from the very beginning.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.520
The first large-scale deployment
of computer

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:15.720
simulation was as part of
the Manhattan Project.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.600
This was done during the war
to model the process of

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:29.380
nuclear detonation.

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.840
And, in fact, what they did was
a simulation of 12 hard

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.110
spheres, and what would
happen when they would

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.960
bump into each other.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.300
It was a huge step forward to
do it with simulation, since

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.110
the whole project had been
stalled by their attempt to do

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.830
this analytically.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:51.050
They were unable to actually
solve the problem

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.480
analytically.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.120
And it was only when they hit
upon the notion of using a

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.610
computer, a relatively new
tool in those days, to

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.690
simulate it, that they
were able to get the

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.700
answers they needed.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.910
And they did it using something
called a Monte Carlo

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:19.180
simulation.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.010
Now in fact, that's just what
we've been doing with the

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:24.960
random walk, the Monte Carlo
simulation, and I'll come back

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:27.160
to that in a minute.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.940
In general, the thing to think
about, is we use simulation

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:39.500
when we really can't get a
closed form analytic solution.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.750
If you can put down a system of
equations and easily solve

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:47.510
it to get an answer, that's
usually the right thing to do.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.780
But when we can't easily do
that, the right thing to do is

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:54.940
typically to fall back
on simulation.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.930
Sometimes even when we can do
it analytically, simulation

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:05.340
has some advantages, as we'll
be seeing as we go forward.

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.970
What we're typically doing
when we're simulating

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:31.960
anything, is we're attempting
to generate a sample of

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:43.320
representative scenarios.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.010
Because an exhaustive
enumeration of all possible

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:50.330
states would be impossible.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.550
So again, if sometimes you can't
solve it analytically,

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.530
you can exhaustively enumerate
the space and then see

00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:59.280
what's going on.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.210
But again, usually you can't.

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:05.150
And so we look for a sample, and
the key is, it's gotta be

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.960
representative.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.570
Of what we would
get in reality.

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.500
We'll see an example
of that shortly.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:20.120
So simulation attempts to build
an experimental device

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.890
that will act like the real
system in important aspects.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:29.170
So I always think of
a simulation as an

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.180
experimental device.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:37.440
And every time I run it, I'm
running an experiment designed

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.430
to give me some information
about the real world.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.110
These things are enormously
popular, so if you were to get

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:52.690
on Google and look
at simulation.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:47:00.540
So for, example, we could Google
simulation finance.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:06.230
You know, we see we get
about 3,000,000 hits.

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:13.600
We can do biology.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.360
We get twice as many hits,
showing the relative

00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:21.770
importance in the world of
biology and finance.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.150
For all you Course 7 majors,
we should make sure that

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.650
should compare biology
to physics.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:31.280
Oh dear, we'll see that physics
is even more important

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.170
than biology.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.320
And I know we have a lot of
Course 2 students in here, so

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.310
let's try mechanical.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.520
Oh, lot of those, too.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.680
And if I did baseball, or
football, we'd get more than

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.720
any of them.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.110
Showing the real importance
of things in the world.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:48:00.570
As we look at simulations, I
want you to keep in mind that

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:12.930
they are typically descriptive
not prescriptive.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:18.230
So by that I mean, they describe
a situation, they

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:22.590
don't tell you what
the answer is.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:28.790
So another way to think about
this is, a simulation is not

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.370
an optimization procedure.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.180
When we looked at optimization,
that was

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:35.840
prescriptive.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.280
We ran an optimization
algorithm, and it gave us the

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.010
best possible solution.

00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:48.420
A simulation typically doesn't
give you this best possible

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:53.150
solution, but if you give it
the starting point, it will

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:58.780
tell you the consequences
of that.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.930
Now, can we use simulation
to do optimization?

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.780
Absolutely.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.440
For example, we can use it
to do guess and check.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.510
Where we guess a, probably not
to get a truly optimal

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:15.950
solution, but to get a good
solution, we can guess various

00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.880
possibilities, simulate
them, and see.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.750
People do that all the time.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:27.120
If they want to see what's the
right number of checkout

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.920
counters at the supermarket,
or what's the right airline

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.540
schedule to use?

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.803
They'll make a guess, they'll
simulate it, and they'll say

00:49:35.803 --> 00:49:39.980
all right, this was better than
this, so we'll choose it.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.170
All right, I'm going
to stop here.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:45.920
Next time we're going to get
more deeply into the actual

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.720
stochastics, the probability
distributions, and start

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.580
understanding what's going
on under the covers.
