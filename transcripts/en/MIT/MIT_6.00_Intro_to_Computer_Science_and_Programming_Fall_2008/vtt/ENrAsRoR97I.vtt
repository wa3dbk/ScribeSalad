00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.360
PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we're returning to

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.510
simulations.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.910
And I'm going to do at first, a
little bit more abstractly,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.550
and then come back
to some details.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.310
So they're different ways to
classify simulation models.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:53.570
The first is whether it's
stochastic or deterministic.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.400
And the difference here is in
a deterministic simulation,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.170
you should get the same result
every time you run it.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.880
And there's a lot of uses we'll
see for deterministic

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.880
simulations.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.030
And then there's stochastic
simulations, where the answer

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.720
will differ from run to run
because there's an element of

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.500
randomness in it.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.030
So here if you run it again
and again you get the same

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.310
outcome every time,
here you may not.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.830
So, for example, the problem
set that's due today -- is

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.740
that a stochastic or
deterministic simulation?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.940
Somebody?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.740
Stochastic, exactly.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.200
And that's what we're going
to focus on in this class,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.990
because one of the interesting
questions we'll see about

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.160
stochastic simulations is, how
often do have to run them

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.990
before you believe the answer?

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.940
And that turns out to be
a very important issue.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.960
You run it once, you get
an answer, you can't

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.740
take it to the bank.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.850
Because the next time you run
it, you may get a completely

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.250
different answer.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.250
So that will get us a little
bit into the whole issue of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.130
statistical analysis.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:31.180
Another interesting dichotomy
is static vs dynamic.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.810
We'll look at both, but
will spend more

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.640
time on dynamic models.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.340
So the issue -- it's
not my phone.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.340
If it's your mother, you could
feel free to take it,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.150
otherwise --

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.600
OK, no problem.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.090
Inevitable.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.640
In a dynamic situation,
time plays a role.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.900
And you look at how things
evolve over time.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.950
In a static simulation, there
is no issue with time.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.700
We'll be looking at both, but
most of the time we'll be

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.990
focusing on dynamic ones.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.060
So an example of this kind of
thing would be a queuing

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.930
network model.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.630
This is one of the most popular
and important kinds of

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.250
dynamic simulations.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.680
Where you try and look at how
queues, a fancy word for

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.580
lines, evolve over time.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.320
So for example, people who are
trying to decide how many

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.970
lanes should be in a highway,
or how far apart the exits

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.390
should be, or what should the
ratio of Fast Lane tolls to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.650
manually staffed tolls
should be.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.240
All use queuing networks to try
and answer that question.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.230
And we'll look at some examples
of these later

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.450
because they are
very important.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.080
Particularly for things
related to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.440
scheduling and planning.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:26.790
A third dichotomy is discrete
vs continuous.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.590
Imagine, for example, trying to
analyze the flow of traffic

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.590
along the highway.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.020
One way to do it, is to try and
have a simulation which

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.950
models each vehicle.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.070
That would be a discrete
simulation, because you've got

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.800
different parts.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.490
Alternatively, you might decide
to treat traffic as a

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.970
flow, kind of like water flowing
through things, where

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.410
changes in the flow can
be described by

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.910
differential equations.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.020
That would lead to a
continuous model.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.560
Another example is, a lot of
effort has gone into analyzing

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.090
the way blood flows through
the human body.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.250
You can try and model it
discretely, where you take

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.060
each red blood cell, each white
blood cell, and look at

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.770
how they move, or simulate
how they move.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.280
Or you could treat it
continuously and say, well,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.990
we're just going to treat blood
as a fluid, not made up

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.190
of discrete components, and
write some equations to model

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.630
how that fluid goes through
and then simulate that.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.300
In this course, we're going to
be focusing mostly on discrete

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.610
simulations.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.230
Now if we think about the random
walk we looked at,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:10.350
indeed it was stochastic,
dynamic, and discrete.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.770
The random walk was an example
of what's called a Monte Carlo

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.520
simulation.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.240
This term was coined there.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.450
Anyone know what that is?

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.170
Anyone want to guess?

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.530
It's the casino, in Monaco,
in Monte Carlo.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.060
It was at one time, before there
was even a Las Vegas,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.090
the most famous casino in
the world certainly.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.060
Still one of the more opulent
ones as you can see.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.560
And unlike Las Vegas, it's real
opulence, as opposed to

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.090
faux opulence.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.680
And this term Monte Carlo
simulation, was coined by Ulam

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.010
and Metropolis, two
mathematicians, back in 1949,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.050
in reference to the fact that at
Monte Carlos, people bet on

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.480
roulette wheels, and cards on
a table, games of chance,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.500
where there was randomness, and
things are discrete, in

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.120
some sense.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.400
And they decided, well, this is
just like gambling, and so

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.370
they called them Monte
Carlos simulations.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.820
What Is it that makes
this approach work?

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:40.430
And, in some sense, I won't go
into a lot of the math, but I

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.470
would like to get some
concepts across.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.130
This is an application of what
are called inferential

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.960
statistics.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.500
You have some sample size, some
number of points, and

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.860
from that you try to infer
something more general.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.230
We always depend upon one
property when we do this.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:18.990
And that property is that, a
randomly chosen sample tends

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:44.360
to exhibit the same properties
as the population from which

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:55.600
it is drawn.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.360
So you take a population of
anything, red balls and black

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.020
balls, or students, or steps,
and at random draw some

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:11.940
sample, and you assume that
that sample has properties

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.480
similar to the entire
population.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:23.750
So if I were to go around this
room and choose some random

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:32.220
sample of you guys and write
down your hair color, we would

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.730
be assuming that the fraction
of you with blonde hair in

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.330
that sample would be the same
as the fraction of you with

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.480
blonde hair in the
whole class.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.510
That's kind of what
this means.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.550
And the same would be true of
black hair, auburn hair, etc.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:57.360
So consider, for example,
flipping a coin.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.020
And if I were to flip it some
number of times, say 100

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:09.780
times, you might be able to,
from the proportion of heads

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.380
and tails, be able to
infer whether or not

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.230
the coin was fair.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.700
That is to say, half the times
it would be heads, in half the

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.460
times it would be that tails, or
whether it was unfair, that

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.450
it was somehow weighted, so that
heads would come up more

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.160
than tails.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.800
And you might say if we did this
100 times and looked at

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.660
the results, then we could make
a decision about what

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.130
would happen in general when
we looked at the coin.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:45.830
So let's look in an example
of doing that.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.880
So I wrote a little program,
it's on your

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.540
handout, to flip a coin.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.210
So this looks like
the simulations

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.370
we looked at before.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.400
I've got flip trials, which says
that the number of heads

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.320
and tails is 0 for
i in x range.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.690
What is x range?

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.410
So normally you would have
written, for i in range zero

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.580
to num flips.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.570
What range does, is it creates a
list, in this case from 0 to

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:27.420
99 and goes through the
list of one at a time.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:34.150
That's fine, but supposed num
flips were a billion.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.280
Well, range would create
a list with a

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.090
billion numbers in it.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.190
Which would take a lot of
space in the computer.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.980
And it's kind of wasted.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:50.630
What x range says is, don't
bother creating the list just

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.440
go through the, in this case,
the numbers one at a time.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.890
So it's much more efficient
than range.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.260
It will behave the same way as
far as the answers you get,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.480
but it doesn't use
as much space.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.270
And since some of the
simulations we'll be doing

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.160
will have lots of trials, or
lots of flips, it's worth the

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.730
trouble to use x range
instead of range.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.180
Yeah?

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.870
Pardon?

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.588
STUDENT: Like, why would
we ever use range

00:12:25.588 --> 00:12:26.210
instead of x range?

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.530
PROFESSOR: No good reason, when
dealing with numbers,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.650
unless you wanted to do
something different with the

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:39.490
list. But, there's
no good reason.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.900
The right answer for
the purposes of

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.040
today is, no good reason.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.480
I typically use x range
all the time if I'm

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.980
thinking about it.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:51.700
It was just something that
didn't seem worth introducing

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.220
earlier in this semester.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.210
But good question.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:03.010
Certainly deserving of
a piece of candy.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.610
All right, so for i in x range,
coin is equal some

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.950
random integer 0 or 1.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.910
If coin is equal to 0 then
heads, else tails.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.010
Well, that's pretty easy.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:19.620
And then all I'm going to do
here is go through and flip it

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.720
a bunch of times, and
we'll get some

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.920
answer, and do some plots.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.900
So let's look at an example.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:55.480
We'll try -- we'll flip 100
coins, we'll do 100 trials and

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.660
see what we get.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.360
Error in multi-line statement.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.020
All right, what have
I done wrong here?

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.410
Obviously did something by
accident, edited something I

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.920
did not intend edit.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.190
Anyone spot what I did wrong?

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.410
Pardon?

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.150
The parentheses.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.520
I typed where I didn't intend.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.960
Which line?

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.930
Down at the bottom?

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:35.940
Obviously my, here, yes,
I deleted that.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:46.930
Thank you.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:52.250
All right, so we have a couple
of figures here.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:59.230
Figure one, I'm showing
a histogram.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:05.680
The number of trials on the
y-axis and the difference

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.130
between heads and tails , do
I have more of one than the

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.920
other on the x-axis.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.310
And so we what we could see
out of my 100 trials,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:20.140
somewhere around 22 of them
came out the same,

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.410
close to the same.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.900
But way over here we've
got some funny ones.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.810
100 and there was a
difference of 25.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.070
Pretty big difference.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.890
Another way to look at the same
data, and I'm doing this

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.180
just to show that there are
different ways of looking at

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:46.650
data, is here, what I've plotted
is each trial, the

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.900
percent difference.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:51.400
So out of 100 flips.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.830
And this is normalizing it,
because if I flip a million

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.190
coins, I might expect the
difference to be pretty big in

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.420
absolute terms, but maybe
very small as a

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.790
percentage of a million.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.900
And so here, we can again see
that as these stochastic kinds

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.020
of things, there's a pretty
big difference, right?

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:17.680
We've got one where it was over
25 percent, and several

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.290
where it's zero.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.030
So the point here, we can see
from this graph, that if I'd

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:28.260
done only one trial and just
assumed that was the answer as

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.040
to whether my coin was weighted
or not, I could

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.100
really have fooled myself.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:40.600
So the the main point is that
you need to be careful when

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.520
you're doing these
kinds of things.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.310
And this green line
here is the mean.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:54.740
So it says on average, the
difference was seven precent.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:14.750
Well suppose, maybe, instead
of, flipping 100, I were to

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:42.480
flip 1,000.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.990
Well, doesn't seem to
want to notice it.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.560
One more try and then I'll
just restart it, which is

00:17:48.560 --> 00:18:07.250
always the safest thing as
we've discussed before.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:14.760
Well, we won't panic.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:20.830
Sometimes this helps.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:26.820
If not, here we go.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.890
So let's say we wanted
to flip 1,000 coins.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:33.880
So now what do we think?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.920
Is the difference going to be
bigger or smaller than when we

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.620
flipped 100?

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.750
Is the average difference
between heads and tails bigger

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:48.950
or smaller with 1,000 flips
than with 100 flips?

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.930
Well, the percentage will be
smaller, but in absolute

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.970
terms, it's probably going
to be bigger, right?

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:01.750
Because I've got more
chances to stray.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:17.890
But we'll find out.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:22.930
So here we see that the mean
difference is somewhere in the

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.670
twenties, which was much
higher than the mean

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.370
difference for 100 flips.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.920
On the other hand, if we look at
the percentage, we see it's

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.560
much lower.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.770
Instead of seven percent, it's
around two and a half percent

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.710
in the main.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.160
There's something else
interesting to observe in

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:44.860
figure two, relative to when we
looked at with 100 flips.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.500
What else is pretty interesting
about the

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.620
difference between these two
figures, if you can remember

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.460
the other one?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:52.820
Yeah?

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.500
STUDENT: There are no zeros?

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.850
PROFESSOR: There are no zeros.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:04.660
That's right, as it happens
there were no zeros.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.290
Not so surprising that it
didn't ever come out

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.560
exactly 500, 500.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.420
What else?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.810
What was the biggest difference,
percentage-wise,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.030
we saw last time?

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.930
Over 25.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:24.940
So notice how much narrower
the range is here.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.480
Instead of ranging from 2 to 25
or something like that, it

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.620
ranges from 0 to 7, or
maybe 7 and a little.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:41.400
So, by flipping more coins, the
experiment becomes more

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.800
reproduce-able.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.450
I'm looks like the same because
of scaling, but in

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.630
fact the range is
much narrower.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.200
Each experiment tends to give
an answer closer to all the

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.280
other experiments.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.230
That's a good thing.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:08.300
It should give you confidence
that the answers are getting

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.900
pretty close to right.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.810
That they're not bouncing
all over the place.

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.360
And if I were to flip a million
coins, we would find

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:22.010
the range would get
very tight.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.810
So notice that even though
there's similar information in

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:30.380
the histogram and the plot,
different things leap out at

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.790
you, as you look at it.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.240
All right, we could ask a lot of
other interesting questions

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.460
about coins here.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.080
But, we'll come back to this in
a minute and look at some

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.030
other questions.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:56.390
I want to talk again a little
bit more generally.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.370
It's kind of easy to think about
running a simulation to

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.770
predict the future.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.730
So in some sense, we look at
this, and this predicts what

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.680
might happen if I flipped
1,000 coins.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:16.620
That the most likely event
would be that I'd have

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:24.910
something under 10 in the
difference between heads and

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.680
tails, but that it's not
terribly unlikely that I might

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:34.730
have close to 70 as
a difference.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:38.090
And if I ran more than 100
trials I'd see more, but this

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:42.660
helps me predict what
might happen.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.150
Now we don't always use
simulations to predict what

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.960
might happen.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.690
We sometimes actually use
simulations to understand the

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.540
current state of the world.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.460
So for example, if I told you
that we are going to flip

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:06.930
three coins, and I wanted you
to predict the probability

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.960
that all three would be
either heads, or all

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.050
three would be tails.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:14.410
Well, if you'd studied any
probability, you could know

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:15.990
how to do that.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:18.770
If you hadn't studied
probability, you would say,

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.210
well, that's OK, we have a
simulation right here.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:27.170
Let's just do it.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:45.360
Here we go again.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.670
And so let's try it.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:24:06.160
Let's flip three coins, and
let's do it 4,000 times here.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.630
Well, that's kind
of hard to read.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.720
It's pretty dense.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:19.260
But we can see that the
mean here is 50.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.630
And, this is a little
easier to read.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:31.580
This tells us that, how many
times will the difference,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:38.200
right, be zero 3,000
out of 4,000.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.920
Is that right?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.020
What do you think?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.050
Do you believe this?

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:47.140
Have I done the right thing?
three coins, 4,000 flips, how

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.280
often should they all be heads,
or how often should

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.000
they all be tails?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:54.840
What does this tell us?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:01.150
It tells us one-fourth of the
time they'll all be-- the

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.920
difference between, wait a
minute, how can the difference

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.610
between -- something's wrong
with my code, right?

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.800
Because I only have two
possible values.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.110
I hadn't expected this.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.690
I obviously messed
something up.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.000
Pardon?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.770
STUDENT: It's right.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:24.050
PROFESSOR: It's right,
because?

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.992
STUDENT: Because you had an odd
number of flips, and when

00:25:28.992 --> 00:25:29.360
you split them --

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:29.720
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.070
STUDENT: When you split
an odd number --

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.070
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.380
So it is correct.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.860
And it gives us what we want.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.150
But now, let's think about
a different situation.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.420
Anybody got a coin here?

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.670
Anyone give me three coins?

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:55.100
I can trust somebody, I hope.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.160
What a cheap -- anybody got
silver dollars, would be

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.420
preferable?

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.470
All right, look at this.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:06.640
She's very carefully given
me three pennies.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.710
She had big, big money in that
purse, too, but she didn't

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.120
want me to have it.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.140
All right, so I'm going to
take these three pennies,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.440
jiggle them up, and now ask you,
what's the probability

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.290
that all three of
them are heads?

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.770
Anyone want to tell me?

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:30.180
It's either 0 or 1, right?

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.050
And I can actually look
at you and tell you

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.890
exactly which it is.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:38.420
And you can't see which it is.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.070
So, how should you think about
what the probability it?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:48.960
Well, you might as well assume
that it's whatever this graph

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.810
tells you it is.

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.730
Because the fact that you
don't have access to the

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.570
information, means that you
really might as well treat the

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.250
present as if it's the future.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.400
That it's unknown.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.950
And so in fact we frequently,
when there's data out there

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.420
that we don't have access to,
we use simulations and

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.570
probabilities to estimate, make
our best guess, about the

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.690
current state of the world.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:24.670
And so, in fact, guessing the
value of the current state, is

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.900
really no different from
predicting the value of a

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:34.230
future state when you don't
have the information.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:40.530
In general, all right, now,
just to show that your

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:52.860
precautions were unnecessary.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.170
Where was I?

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.660
Right.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:05.470
In general, when we're trying
to predict the future, or in

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:09.850
this case, guess the present, we
have to use information we

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:17.100
already have to make our
prediction or our best guess.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.590
So to do that, we have to always
ask the question, is

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:28.860
past behavior a good prediction
of future behavior?

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.095
So if I flip a coin 1,000 times
and count up the heads

00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:35.230
and tails, is that a good
prediction what will happen

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:39.720
the next time?

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.010
This is a step people often
omit, in doing these

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.360
predictions.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.430
See the recent meltdown of
the financial system.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.910
Where people had lots of
stochastic simulations

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.040
predicting what the market would
do, and they were all

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.640
wrong, because they were all
based upon assuming samples

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.660
drawn from the past would
predict the future.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.270
So, as we build these models,
that's the question you always

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.840
have to ask yourself.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.770
Is, in some sense, this true?

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.810
Because usually what we're doing
is, we're choosing a

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:21.130
random sample from the
past and hoping it

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:24.960
predicts the future.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.700
And that is to say, is the
population we have available

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.620
the same has the one
in the future.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.620
So it's easy to see how one
might use these kinds of

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.570
simulations to figure out things
that are inherently

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.150
stochastic.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:47.300
So for example, to predict
a poker hand.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.830
What's the probability of my
getting a full house when I

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.060
draw this card from the deck?

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.770
To predict the probability of
coming up with a particular

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.530
kind of poker hand.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.080
Is a full house more probable
than a straight?

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.300
Or not?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.600
Well, you can deal out lots of
cards, and count them up, just

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.360
as Ulam suggested
for Solitaire.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.690
And that's often what we do.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.720
Interestingly enough though,
we can use randomized

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.430
techniques to get solutions
to problems that are not

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.000
inherently stochastic.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
And that's what I
want to do now.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.770
So, consider for example, pi.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:41.900
Many of you have probably
heard of this.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.140
For thousands of years,
literally, people have known

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:51.390
that there is a constant, pi,
associated with circles such

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:59.820
that pi times the radius squared
equals the area.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.160
And they've known that pi times
the diameter is equal to

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:08.740
the circumference.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.120
So, back in the days of the
Egyptian pharaohs, it was

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.870
known that such a constant
existed.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.910
In fact, it didn't acquire
the name pi

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.260
until the 18th century.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.500
And so they called it
other things, but

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.660
they knew it existed.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.130
And for thousands of years,
people have speculated on what

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.460
it's value was.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:42.530
Sometime around 1650 BC, the
Egyptians said that pi was

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.850
3.16, something called
the Rhind Papyrus,

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:52.230
something they found.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:56.620
Many years later, about
1,000 years later, the

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:04.540
Bible said pi was three.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:11.450
And I quote, this is describing
the specifications

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.170
for the Great Temple of Solomon.
"He made a molten sea

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.720
of 10 cubits from brim to brim,
round in compass, and 5

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.800
cubit the height thereof, and
a line of 30 cubits did

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:29.780
compass it round about." So, all
right, so what we've got

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:32.070
here is, we've got everything
we need to plug into these

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:37.070
equations and solve for pi,
and it comes out three.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:42.300
And it does this in more than
one place in the Bible.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.440
I will not comment on the
theological implications of

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.960
this assertion.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.030
Sarah Palin might.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.330
And Mike Huckabee
certainly would.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:33:00.790
The first theoretical
calculation of pi was carried

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.820
out by Archimedes, a great
Greek mathematician from

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:11.150
Syracuse, that was about
somewhere around 250 BC.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:19.040
And he said that pi was
somewhere between 223 divided

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:31.190
by 71, and 22 divided by 7.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.550
This was amazingly profound.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:39.340
He knew he didn't know what the
answer was, but he had a

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.030
way to give an upper and a lower
bound, and say it was

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:45.190
somewhere between these
two values.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:50.630
And in fact if you calculate it,
the average of those two

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:56.210
values is 3.1418.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.830
Not bad for the time.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.880
This was not by measurement,
he actually had a very

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.750
interesting way of
calculating it.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:09.260
All right, so this is where it
stood, for years and years,

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.200
because of course people forgot
the Rhind Papyrus, and

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.250
they forgot Archimedes, and they
believed the Bible, and

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:19.040
so three was used
for a long time.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.710
People sort of knew it wasn't
right, but still.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:33.170
Then quite interestingly, Buffon
and Laplace, two great

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.580
French mathematicians, actually
people had better

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.690
estimates using Archimedes'
methods long before they came

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:45.780
along, proposed a way to do
it using a simulation.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:52.580
Now, since Laplace lived between
1749 and 1827, it was

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.240
not a computer simulation.

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.010
So I'm going to show you,
basically, the way that he

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:08.150
proposed to do it. the basic
idea was you take a square,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.410
assume that's a square, and you
inscribe in it a quarter

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.060
of a circle.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:23.870
So here, you have the radius
of the square r.

00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:31.490
And then you get some person to,
he used needles, but I'm

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:37.130
going to use darts, to throw
darts at the shape.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:44.520
And some number of the darts
will land in the circle part,

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.960
and some number of the darts
will land out here, in the

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.610
part of the square that's not
inscribed by the circle.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:36:02.260
And then we can look at the
ratio of the darts in the

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:10.560
shaded area divided by
the total number of

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:16.900
darts in the square.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:27.220
And that's equal to the shaded
area divided by the area of

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:31.070
the square.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.800
The notion being, if they're
landing at random in these

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:41.460
places, the proportion here and
not here will depend upon

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.540
the relative areas.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.870
And that certainly
makes sense.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.780
If this were half the area of
the square, then you'd expect

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:55.130
half the darts to
land in here.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.970
And then as you can see in your
handout, a little simple

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:09.000
algebra can take this, plus pi r
squared equals the area, you

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.180
can solve for pi, and you can
get that pi is equal to 4, and

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:20.210
I'll write it, h, where h is
the hit ratio, the number

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.810
falling in here.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:27.330
So people sort of see why that
should work intuitively?

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.660
And that it's a very clever idea
to use randomness to find

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.090
a value that there's nothing
random about.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.570
So we can now do
the experiment.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:42.330
I need volunteers
to throw darts.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.100
Come on.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.500
Come on up.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.360
I need more volunteers.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.360
I have a lot of darts.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.230
Anybody else?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.130
Anybody?

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:00.270
All right, then since you're
all in the front

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:07.330
row, you get stuck.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.180
So now we'll try it.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.780
And you guys, we'll see how many
of you hit in the circle,

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:20.910
and how many of you hit there.

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.160
Go ahead, on the count of
3, everybody throw.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.350
1, 2, 3.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.880
Ohh!

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.220
He did that on purpose.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.450
You'll notice Professor Grimson
isn't here today, and

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.240
that's because I told him he was
going to have to hold the

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.240
dart board.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.680
Well, what we see here is, we
ignore the ones that missed

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.890
all together.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.590
And we'll see that, truly,
I'm assuming

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.180
these are random throws.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.570
We have one here and two here.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:39:01.430
Well, your eyes will tell you
that's the wrong ratio.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.660
Which suggests that having
students throw darts is not

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.390
the best way to solve
this problem.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:09.770
And so you will see in your
handout a computer

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:14.250
simulation of it.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:20.300
So let's look at that.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.520
So this is find pi.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.380
So at the beginning of this
code, by the way, it's not on

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.540
your handout, is some magic.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.530
I got tired of looking at big
numbers without commas

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.910
separating the thousands
places.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.440
You've see me in other
lectures counting

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.920
the number of zeros.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.630
What we have here is, that just
tells it I have to have

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.050
two versions, one for the
Mac, and one for the PC.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.070
To set some variables that had
to write integers, things in

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:54.380
general, and I'm saying here, do
it the way you would do it

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.940
in the United States
in English.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.530
And UTF8 is just an extended
character code.

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.350
Anyway, you don't need to learn
anything about this

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.930
magic, but it's just a handy
little way to make the numbers

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.290
easier to read.

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:14.940
All right, so let's let's
try and look at it.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.740
There's not much interesting
to see here.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.680
I've done this little thing,
format ints, that uses this

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.910
magic to say grouping equals
true, that means put a comma

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:27.990
in the thousand places.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.470
But again, you can
ignore all that.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:37.860
The interesting part, is that
from Pylab I import star,

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.640
import random in math.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.730
As some of you observed, the
order these imports matters.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.970
I think I sent out an email
yesterday explaining what was

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.510
going on here.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.880
This was one of the things
that I knew, and probably

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.120
should've mentioned.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.250
But since I knew it, I thought
everyone knew.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.230
Silly me.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.760
It was of course a dumb
thing to think.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.940
And then I'm going to throw
a bunch of darts.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.140
The other thing you'll notice
is, throw darts has a

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.910
parameter called should plot.

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:09.370
And that's because when I
throw a billion darts, I

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.530
really don't want to try and
take the time to plot a

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.420
billion points.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.030
So let's first look at
a little example.

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:32.090
We'll try throwing
10,000 darts.

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:38.640
And it gives me an estimated
value of pi of 3.16.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:44.370
And what we'll see here, is
that the number of darts

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.660
thrown, the estimate
changes, right?

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:52.780
When I threw one dart, the
estimate of pi was 4.

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.780
I threw my second dart, it
dropped all the way to 3.

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.450
And then it bounced around a
while, and then at the end, it

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.420
starts to really stabilize
around the true value.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.680
You'll notice, by the way, that
what I've got here is a

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.420
logarithmic x-axis.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:11.620
If you look at the code, you'll
see I've told it to be

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.710
semi log x.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.440
And that's because I wanted you
to be able to see what was

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.460
happening early on, where
it was fluctuating.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.490
But out here it's kind of
boring, because the

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.970
fluctuations are so small.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:34.100
So that was a good
way to do it.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.020
All right now.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.940
Do I think I have enough
samples here?

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.290
Well, I don't want you to cheat
and look at the estimate

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.070
and say no, you don't, because
you know that's

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.740
not the right answer.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:51.670
And, it's not even as good
as Archimedes did.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:55.360
But how could you sort of look
at the data, and get a sense

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.580
that maybe this is not
the right answer?

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.720
Well, even at the end, if we
look at it, it's still

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.390
wiggling around a fair amount.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:12.050
We can zoom in.

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:14.220
And it's bouncing up
and down here.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.350
I'm in a region, but it's sort
of makes us think that maybe

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.100
it hasn't stabilized, right?

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:27.150
You'd like it to not be
moving very much.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:31.080
Now, by the way, the other thing
we could've looked at,

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:38.490
when we ran it, let's run
it again, probably get a

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:43.700
different answer by the way.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.160
Yeah, notice the different
answer here.

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.020
Turns out to be a better answer,
but it's just an

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:55.760
accident, right?

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.270
Notice in the beginning it
fluctuates wildly, and it

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.810
fluctuates less wildly
at the end.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.850
Why is that?

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.545
And don't just say because
it's close to right

00:44:06.545 --> 00:44:09.210
and it knows it.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:13.180
Why do the mathematics of this,
in some sense, tell us

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:16.450
it has to fluctuate less
wildly at the end?

00:44:16.450 --> 00:44:17.200
Yes?

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:22.950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:27.100
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
exactly right.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.130
If I've only thrown two darts,
the third dart can have a big

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.110
difference in the
average value.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.710
But if I've thrown a million
darts, the million and first

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.530
can't matter very much.

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.510
And what this tells me is, as
I want ever more digits of

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:47.570
precision, I have to run a lot
more trials to get there.

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.960
And that's often true, that
simulations can get you in the

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.180
neighborhood quickly, but the
more precision you want, the

00:44:55.180 --> 00:45:00.920
number of steps grows
quite quickly.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.570
Now, the fact that I got such
different answers the two

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:08.000
times I ran this suggests
strongly that I shouldn't

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.310
believe either answer.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:13.300
Right?

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:17.300
So we need to do
something else.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:30.890
So let's try something else.

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.760
Let's try throwing a lot
more darts here,

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:42.420
and see what we get.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.780
Now if you look at my code,
you'll see I'm printing

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.950
intermediate values.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.700
Every million darts, I'm
printing the value.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.890
And I did that because the first
time I ran this on a big

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.920
number, I was afraid I had an
infinite loop and my program

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.570
was not working.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.040
So I just said, all right, let's
put a print statement in

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.560
the loop, so I could see that
it's making progress.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.910
And then I decided it was just
kind of nice to look at it, to

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:11.390
see what was going on here.

00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:15.970
So now you see that if I throw
10 million darts, I'm starting

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.500
to get a much better estimate.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.580
You'll also see, as predicted,
that as I get further out, the

00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.300
value of the estimate changes
less and less with each

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.590
million new darts, because it's
a smaller fraction of the

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.570
total darts.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:36.000
But it's getting a lot better.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.650
Still not quite there.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:47.190
Let's just see what happens,
I can throw in another one.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.230
This is going to take
a little while.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.930
So I can talk while
it's running.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:47:06.790
Oops, what did I do here?

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:12.520
So, it's going to keep on going
and going and going.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.520
And then if we were to run it
with this number of darts

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.950
several times over, we would
discover that we got answers

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:22.040
that were very, very similar.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:27.010
From that we can take comfort,
statistically, that we're

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:30.880
really getting close to the
same answer every time, so

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:34.810
we've probably thrown enough
darts to feel comfortable that

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:39.580
we're doing what's statistically
the right thing.

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.650
And that there maybe isn't
a lot of point in

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.750
throwing more darts.

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:48.120
Does that mean that we have
the right answer?

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.690
No, not necessarily, and that's
what we're going to

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:53.750
look at next week.
