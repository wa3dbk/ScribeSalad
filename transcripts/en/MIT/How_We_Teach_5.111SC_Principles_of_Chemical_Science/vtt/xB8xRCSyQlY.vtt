CATHERINE DRENNAN: The
idea was in a big class

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.610
of like 300 students,
most of the students

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.460
are not going to have
an opportunity really

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.900
to meet the professors.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.090
They may go to office hours,
but even then, the office hours,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.390
you can't schedule your
office hours at a time

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.490
where all 300 people in
the class are available.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.410
So you'll just get
to know maybe a few.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.120
But with the pizza
forums, they're

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.510
every few weeks
during the semester,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.300
and we encourage
at least one person

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150
from each recitation to come.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.850
And it's just a way
for the students

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.760
to get to know the
faculty and vice versa.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.995
And sometimes we discuss things
about chemistry, you know,

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:43.870
especially if people
have suggestions of what

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.024
they like and don't like.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.690
But a lot of times, they're just
talking about their experiences

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.790
at MIT.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.870
And there have been some
really useful things,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.620
I think, for the course
that have come out

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.610
of it, like learning,
for example,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.110
that we had our problems
sets due at the same time

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.000
as pretty much all of
their other classes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.530
So we moved it to a different
day because that made no sense.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.380
And also, kind of some of
the educational ways-- what

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.520
clickers they're using,
how they like them.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.310
We heard some horrible
things about clickers

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.120
that had been used in physics.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.504
And so then they
started to change them.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:17.920
And when we looked
at clickers, we

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.050
learned from the
physics experience.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.170
But it really came through
knowing that from the students,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.990
rather than talking
to the other faculty.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740
We had sort of heard what
worked and didn't work.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.250
So having those kind of
direct conversations.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.320
And they feel like they're
representing the student

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800
body in saying, oh
we like this, or we

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.800
don't like that,
or have you thought

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.420
about doing something this way.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.980
And it's just also a lot of fun.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.860
And everyone goes around
and says where they're from.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.680
I love to ask them, what
is one thing about MIT

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.810
that is exactly
what you expected

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.940
and what's one thing
that really surprised you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.960
when you got here?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.180
And I just find it
really interesting

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.180
to see what people said.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.080
And I often get, I expected
everyone to be smart,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.820
everybody is smart.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.780
I expected everyone to
be just more serious,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.100
but people are fun
and nice and silly

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.540
and they're kind of
like normal people

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
and that sort of surprised me.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.690
So that is always a
lot of fun to hear that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.050
and get to know them.
