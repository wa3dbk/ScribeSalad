CATHERINE DRENNAN: I of
course want my students

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.220
to be as excited about
chemistry as I am.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.470
And, you know, I feel like MIT
is a relatively serious place.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.740
But the MIT students
are really fun people.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.110
And they're willing to
make fun of themselves

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.490
and be a little geeky.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.330
And I love that.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.490
And so whenever I can kind
of encourage something

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.910
like that in class, I always
try to take advantage of it.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.590
And one of the
things I like to ask

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.520
them is sort of if one geek
is going to propose marriage

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.520
to another geek, do you
really give them a diamond?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.600
Or maybe graphite.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.320
Because, you know, one is more
kinetically stable and one's

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.700
more thermodynamically stable.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.741
And what's the best gift?

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:50.050
And that often-- then they
can discuss which they think.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.300
And then I'm like,
actually, neither

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.570
because what you should give
them is the Green Lantern ring.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.371
And then someone can say, what
about Lord of the Rings ring,

00:00:58.371 --> 00:00:58.870
you know.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.369
And so you have-- you can sort
of bring in these [? funs, ?]

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.190
but, you know, your
arguments are kind of

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.820
based on chemical principles
rather than other things.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.730
So if you can really bring
in sort of the fun humor

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.320
that MIT students enjoy, and
they're always with me on that,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.070
and I love that part.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.080
So I'm always looking for
ways to kind of have something

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.225
be a little bit more
fun, especially in some

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.540
of-- and some of the units, I
feel, really lend themselves

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.620
to these fun examples.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.960
And other ones are a
bit more challenging.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.630
But I want to make sure that
everyone has something in.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.820
And if I find something
online or whatever,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.980
I really try to use
that in my class.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.660
And I found these videos
of dogs teaching chemistry,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.060
which at least some
of the students love.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.025
There's always a few MIT
students who are like,

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.960
I wish you would just
stick to the facts

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.460
and straight derivations.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.490
But for the most part,
I think, attendance

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.890
would suggest that students
come and that they're engaged

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.800
and that they're seeing
these little things.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.685
And I've discovered
that it really

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.060
helps people remember, when
you do something a little bit

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.090
different.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.010
One of my favorite things to do
is when I teach about buffers,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.169
I don't know why,
so many students

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.020
have trouble with the concept
of buffering, acid base

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.160
titrations.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.190
It's just really hard
for a number of people.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.930
So I thought over
the years of ways

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.960
that I can really get them
to remember certain things.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.716
And some of it, I can make fun.

00:02:21.716 --> 00:02:23.590
Others is have to figure
out how to just make

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.110
them memorize certain things.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.800
And really just get them there
where they can just do this

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.940
off the top of their head.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.514
And so when I talk
about a buffer,

00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:34.180
I always want to make
the point that you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.740
need in your
[INAUDIBLE] buffer, you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.570
need something
that's a weak acid,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.270
and the conjugate of that
is a conjugate weak base.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.850
And you can't just have an
acid, or just have a base.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:43.600
That won't buffer.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.980
Because you need something.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.810
If you add acid,
you need something

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.600
that will buffer it to
keep the pH constant.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.190
If you add base,
you need something

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.330
that will-- so it
has to go both ways.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.460
So I like to dress up.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.310
And I have the abbreviation
for a weak acid

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.787
taped on the front of my shirt.

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:00.370
And the abbreviation
for the weak base

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.660
taped on the back of my shirt.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.700
And I said, I am a buffer.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.760
And I'm an acid, and then
I turn around, I'm a base,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.140
and I turn around again.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.430
I'm an acid.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.380
And I just twirl
around the classroom.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.340
And I said, I want this
engraved in your brain

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.300
that a buffer has to have both
a weak acid and a weak base.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.460
And if I keep
twirling like this,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.410
you will try to
purge this memory

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.200
from your brain of
Professor Drennan twirling

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.420
around the classroom
as an acid and a base,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.810
but you won't be able to.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.880
It'll be with you for
the rest of your life.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.700
You'll be on your
deathbed going please,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.440
can the image of
Professor Drennan

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.390
twirling around in
that silly t-shirt

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.610
that she made with lab tape,
please, can it leave my brain

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.110
now?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.810
But no, no.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.060
It will be with you forever.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.160
And when I do that,
the students do better

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.540
on the acid base problems.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.290
So I am OK with really
embarrassing myself.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.290
Whatever it takes, I
go that extra distance

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.100
because I want them
to remember that.
