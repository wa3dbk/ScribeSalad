CATHERINE DRENNAN:
The first thing

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.854
I do when I'm getting
ready for the class is

00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:09.020
to go over the handouts and
make sure they're really

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.090
what I want, update
them, and go over that.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.180
Then I usually have-- sort
of back to my theater days,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.270
I guess-- a plan
for the lecture.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.310
When the clicker
questions are going to be,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.080
what I'm showing on PowerPoint
presentation, what I'm going

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.650
to be writing on the board.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.660
And so I have it all organized.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.160
There is times when I want
to ask them a question

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680
and how I'm going to do that.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.340
If we're going to have a demo
in that particular class,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.480
where it's going to fit in,
how it's going to be set up.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.780
And I like to bring-- I love
three dimensional things.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.430
So if we're talking about
bonding, I want giant atoms

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.210
and I'm always trying
to think of things

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
that I can bring in
to use to show someone

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.510
some kind of concept.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380
And so I want, at
least once a week,

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.500
to have some kind of
demo in the class.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.340
It's nice.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.390
I also like some geeky science
music and other things.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.830
And then, in the last
year where I taught,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.730
I upped the bar for myself.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.490
So if people are watching the
most current OpenCourseWare,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.340
they will see my
t-shirt collection.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.500
So I decided that in
addition to thinking

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.160
about the demos and
the songs and what

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.010
I'm writing on
the board and when

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.330
I'm going to ask questions
and all of these things,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.390
that I needed to coordinate
it with my wardrobe.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.760
So that was a high bar
that I set for myself.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.780
And that somehow the
t-shirt not only had

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.620
to be some kind of
geeky chemistry thing

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.260
but related, somehow,
to the topic at hand.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.490
So that was one of-- that
took a lot of preparation.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.312
I had to plan.

00:01:45.312 --> 00:01:47.770
So if I had to order t-shirts,
I had to order ahead of time

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.740
so they arrived.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.250
And figuring out a different
t-shirt per lecture,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.750
that was one of the
harder challenges.
