CATHERINE DRENNAN:
So I'm Cathy Drennan.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.530
I'm a professor of chemistry
and biology here at MIT.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm also a professor and
investigator with the Howard

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.930
Hughes Medical
Institute, and I've

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.130
been teaching freshman
chemistry here at MIT,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.990
particularly a course called
511.1 since I started in 1999.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.070
So I've always loved
education, and when

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.110
I started at Vassar
College, I went

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.130
there to study either
drama or biopsychology.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.880
I mentioned I'm a
chemist and a biologist.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.042
You're like, what
happened there?

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:34.500
So I went there
and I didn't really

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.770
know what I wanted to study.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.325
And they said, oh
well, if you're

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.700
thinking of anything biology,
you have to take chemistry.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.740
And I said, oh no.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.410
Please don't make
me take chemistry.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.700
I took it in high school.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.180
I can tell you it has absolutely
nothing to do with biology.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.780
It's deadly, dull,
don't make me.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.460
Well, I had to
take it, and I took

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.670
it freshman year,
first semester,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.160
and fell in love with chemistry.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.890
And I realized it was
about teaching and how

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.360
one teacher could really make
such an enormous difference.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.590
I became interested in teaching.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.270
Vassar College actually had
no research at that point.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.000
So my Summers I had
to do something else.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.550
I couldn't work in
the research lab.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.890
And so I was a summer
camp counselor, and eight

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.110
through 12-year-olds.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.340
And I taught them about botany
and all sorts of other things,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.760
and I was like, this is great.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.520
So I signed up to take
education classes.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.980
And my advisor in chemistry was
like, what now with this thing

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:28.660
I'm signing?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.550
You're taking this
education course?

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.420
What is this?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.540
But I was just absolutely
in love with it.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.140
And then when it was
time for graduation,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289
I thought about
applying to grad school,

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.580
but I wasn't really quite sure.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.882
And I wanted to really try
out this teaching thing

00:01:42.882 --> 00:01:44.090
and see what I thought of it.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.590
So I got a job
teaching high school,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.740
and I taught high school
at a Quaker boarding

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590
school and working hog farm.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.320
And you have to understand,
I'm from New York.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.110
And New York and New Jersey,
I can be an hour away

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.630
from New York City.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.700
That was OK.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.560
And then I was going to Iowa.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.180
So I packed up and moved to Iowa
to this Quaker boarding school,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.560
and I taught chemistry,
biology, and physics and drama.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.650
So that came in handy.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.290
I did end up taking some drama.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.850
And I absolutely loved it.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.000
But as a high school
teacher, I really

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.140
wanted to enrich the curriculum.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.240
And I was looking for
things to say, oh,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.840
you need to learn
this in chemistry

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.670
because the big question that
scientists are trying to answer

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.570
right now is this thing.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.770
And you need to know
this to do that.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.060
But I didn't really know
what this thing was.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.230
So I felt like-- and I
tried to get other material

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.510
to learn more about
the world of research.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.750
But there just wasn't very
much good material out there,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.200
especially for chemistry.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.860
And so I went to grad school
at University of Michigan,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.180
and I thought, OK, I'll learn
about the world of research

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.850
and I'll go back and
teach high school.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.380
And so I just tell people
that I got slightly distracted

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.770
on my pathway to do that.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.180
But I ended up at
MIT and teaching here

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.520
is such a wonderful experience.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.490
I mean, the students are
absolutely incredible.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.950
And I've found a home.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.730
I can run a research
group, but I also can just

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.260
have a fantastic time teaching.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.890
And so that's my
unusual path, I guess,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.096
to teaching this course at MIT.
