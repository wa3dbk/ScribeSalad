CATHERINE DRENNAN: I really want
the students to feel actively

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.040
participating in lectures.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.970
And so the clicker's
definitely help.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.870
I try to space them every five
to seven minutes that there's

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.390
a clicker question.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.090
And I know from teaching
this a number of times

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.640
now that some of the
clicker questions,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.500
they will-- pretty much all
the students will get right.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.105
And they'll be all
happy and feel good.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:31.230
And then there are other
ones that I ask on purpose

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.900
because I know that these are
questions that the students can

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.670
really hang up on on exams.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.160
They're tricky things.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.990
And so I want them
to make the mistake

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.050
when it doesn't count
in the clicker questions

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.810
so they get it
right on the exam.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.330
And so one thing
that I will do, I'll

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.100
often try to get them
to tell-- if they

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.270
got it right, explain why.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.910
So that's one
thing I like to do.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.210
And I go around to different
conferences and things

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.940
and often will pick up free
pens, or free whatever, rulers,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.930
all sorts of stuff
that people give out.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.240
And so then I say, if
someone-- you know,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.990
and they see that
they've gotten it right.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.448
So that makes them feel a little
more confident before they

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:13.070
speak in front of 350 people.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.480
And said, OK, I have this
awesome little periodic table

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.120
ruler thing.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.910
Who can tell me
what the answer is?

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.530
And so then I have a TA go
around with a microphone,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.430
and that they say how they
thought about the problem, what

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.130
the answer is.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.040
And so just kind of
encourage people to talk.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
--ask people to
explain, now that they

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.310
know what the right answer
is, if someone will explain

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.990
why that is the right answer.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990
And I know it's a big
class and people sometimes

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.420
get nervous about talking,
so I bribe people.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.165
So today the person who
answers why that is correct

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:52.310
will get at an MIT
chemistry t-shirt.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.270
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.350
Let's see.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.590
For every-- if you're
using 5 moles of N2,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.760
you need 15 moles
of hydrogen gas.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.550
So since there's not
enough hydrogen gas,

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.400
there's only 10 moles, that
means the hydrogen gas should

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.180
be the limiting reactant since
you would need roughly 3.33

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.909
moles of N2 for it.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:14.950
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Great.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.260
And here is an MIT
chemistry t-shirt.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.460
Other times, if the
clicker question,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.820
you know, it's like
50/50 in the answer,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.690
then I won't tell
them what's right

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.240
and ask them to talk to their
neighbor and vote again.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.450
And sometimes I'll also have
them talk to each other,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.100
and then weigh in on something.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.380
And whenever we're
going to do a demo,

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.970
I want them to think
about what might happen

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.290
and what the possibilities
are, things like that.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.790
And sometimes that will be a
clicker question ahead of time.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.100
And then they're really
ready and engaged

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.250
when they see the demo of what
the answer is going to be.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.010
So those are some of the
things that I can do.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.850
Another one of the
fun things that I

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.900
like when I'm talking
about the difference

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.150
between thermodynamics
and kinetics,

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.440
we can talk about how a reaction
might be thermodynamically

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.030
favorable, and so, you
know, combustion of sugar--

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.760
thermodynamically favorable.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.260
So I'll bring in some candy.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.170
And we do like a demo in class,
and everyone has a candy.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.900
And it's like OK, when
you open it up to oxygen,

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.520
there should be CO2 released.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.120
And so then we do the demo
and see that it's actually

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.270
a slow reaction.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.830
So we don't see the gas release.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.190
But, you know, ways where
everyone in the class

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.650
can have something that
they do a demo with, even

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.170
if it's a little bit silly.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.660
Still there is that engagement
then with the material.
