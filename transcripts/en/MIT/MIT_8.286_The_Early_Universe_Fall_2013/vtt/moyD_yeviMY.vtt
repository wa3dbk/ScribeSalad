00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.690
PROFESSOR: OK, starting again.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.650
I want to begin
with a quick review

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.210
of what we said last time.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.740
This time will be
quicker than usual

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.940
because we're not really
continuing from there,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.300
we'll be starting a
completely new topic today.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.320
But I thought I'd
remind you, nonetheless,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.870
that we had a last lecture--
the universe was not

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.300
created between then and now.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.640
And what we talked
about last time

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.850
was the spacetime
geodesic equation,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.170
which is written this way.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.090
It's a completely
identical to the equation

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.470
we derived for geodesics
in pure spatial situations.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.490
The only difference really,
is a difference in notation.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.390
Instead of using i
and j the tradition

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.890
is to use mu, nu, et cetera
for the spacetime indices which

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.780
are sum from 0 to 3, where
x super 0 is identical to t.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.970
And in addition, the parameter
which is sometimes called s

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.840
when we're talking about
space, is called tau

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.760
when we're talking
about time because what

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.370
the parameter refers
to is the proper time

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.000
along the trajectory of the
object whose geodesic we're

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.810
calculating.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.560
We then introduced the
Schwarzschild metric,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.350
which we did not
derive, but we claimed

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.190
it describes the metric for
any spherically symmetric mass

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.490
distribution as long
as you're talking

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.910
about the region outside
where the masses are located.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.290
And here M is the total
mass of the object, which

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.840
is the only thing the
metric really depends on,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.520
G is Newton's constant, and C
is of course the speed of light.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.350
The metric has an
interesting feature

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.770
that the coefficients
of both the dt

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.750
squared term and to dr squared
term becomes singular either 0

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.770
or infinity, depending on
which one you're looking at,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.620
a particular value of the
radius called the Schwarzschild

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.380
radius, given by this formula
2 GM divided by c squared.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.160
The bigger the mass the bigger
the Schwarzschild radius,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.380
they're proportional
to each other.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.900
The metric is singular
at those points,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.630
but I mentioned
but did not prove,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.250
that that particular
singularity is

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.900
in fact what is referred to
as a coordinate singularity.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.530
It's a singularity that's
there only because of the way

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.495
the coordinates were chosen.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:37.870
So there are other ways of
choosing the coordinates where

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.650
that singularity disappears.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.209
There's also singularity
at r equals zero,

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.750
and that singularity
is real, there's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.860
no way to remove
that singularity

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.185
by a change of coordinates.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.470
However, although r sub s
is not a true singularity,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.470
it is a horizon.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.320
And by that we mean that if any
particle or even a light beam

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.720
gets inside the Schwarzschild
radius, it can never get out.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.225
There's no geodesic which will
take it out of the horizon.

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:14.950
And it's not even a
matter of geodesics,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.660
there are no
time-like paths even

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.330
if you have a rocket which
would then not follow geodesic.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.950
There's no way to get out
from inside a black hole.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.140
We didn't show that, but
that fact is claimed.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.660
Then we calculated the geodesic
for our radially falling

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.300
object.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.260
We solve the problem
of an object that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.360
is released from rest at
some initial value r sub 0,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.590
and just let fall straight
down towards the center

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.580
of the sphere.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.660
And the the equation
describing the geodesic

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.020
is just a special case
of the general equation

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.680
that we had a few slides ago.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.990
And we need only look
at the radial component

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.630
if we want to track how the
radius changes with time.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.270
So there was a free index
mu in the generic form

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.700
of the equation, we're setting
mu equal to the r variable.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.420
And then the equation
reduces to this form

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.450
and we know what these G sub
t t's and G sub r r's are,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.060
they come from the equation
for the Schwarzschild metric

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.910
on the previous slide.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.750
And that equation
can be manipulated

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.125
and eventually it simplifies
to something extraordinarily

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:22.050
simple.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.530
It's just the statement that
d squared r d tau squared is

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.920
equal to minus GM over r
squared, which looks exactly

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.380
like the Newtonian equation
for something falling

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.107
in a spherically symmetric
gravitational field.

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:36.690
But it's not really
the same equation,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.356
it just looks like it's the same
equation, because the variables

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:41.180
both a different
meanings. r and tau

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.840
both have different meanings
from the r and t that

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.950
would have appeared in
the Newtonian calculation.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.200
The r variable that
appears here is not really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.707
the distance from the origin.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.790
If you wanted to know the
distance from the origin

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.160
you'd have to integrate
the metric singular even--

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.600
if not even a well defined
distance to the origin

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.510
because the origin singular.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.000
And the tau that appears
here is a time variable,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.064
but it's not the time that would
be read on any fixed clock,

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:08.480
rather it's the
time that would be

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.070
read on the wristwatch
of the person falling

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.180
into the spherically symmetric
object, which we might consider

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.000
to be a black hole.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.250
And we were able to
solve this equation

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.660
by using essentially
conservation of energy

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.261
techniques, or at least what
would be called conservation

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:29.260
of energy if we were doing
the Newtonian version

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.420
of the problem, which is
the same equation even

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.740
though the variables have
a different interpretation.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.240
So we were able to calculate
not r as a function of tau,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.570
but at least tau
a function of r.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.770
And we got that equation,
which is a little complicated,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.320
but the interesting
thing about it

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.960
is that it gives finite answers
for every value of r going

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.020
all the way down
to r equals zero.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.810
So it means that in a
finite amount of time,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.770
as seen by the person
falling into the black hole,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.740
the person would reach r
equals zero, at which point

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.710
he would disappear
into the singularity.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.780
He'd actually be ripped
apart as he approached

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.950
the singularity
because of tidal forces

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.480
which pull more strongly
on the front part of him

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.360
than on the back part of him,
stretching the object out

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.440
in the radial direction.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.830
However, curiously,
if one calculates

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.820
what this trajectory
looks like as a function

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.300
of the coordinate time,
t, we did actually

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.240
do that calculation
but we looked

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.230
at how it would
behave in the limit

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.720
as you approached-- as
the particle approached

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.010
the Schwarzschild horizon.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.850
And we discovered it would take
an infinite amount of time,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.980
as seen from the outside,
for the in falling object

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.700
to reach the horizon, let
go through the horizon

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.500
and get to r equals zero.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.280
So from the outside, it
looks like the object never

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.210
actually falls into
the black hole,

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.220
but just gets closer and closer
and closer as t approaches

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.240
infinity.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.830
So it's an example of a very
highly distorted spacetime,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.400
where you can see very
different pictures depending

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.250
on which observer you're
trying to describe

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.350
the observations of.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.220
And I think that's it.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.350
Any questions about any of that?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.510
I guess I'll put that back up.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.400
OK.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.030
On your homework you'll be
applying this geodesic equation

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:32.560
to a model universe, to
Robertson-Walker universe,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.645
and this will serve only as an
example for those calculations.

00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.270
I guess there's also a homework
problem about the Schwarzschild

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.460
metric, that orbits in
the Schwarzschild metric

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.389
that you'll be working at.

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:43.930
It's all in principal
straightforward

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.950
if you just look at
equations and follow

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.030
what the equations tell
you, thinking carefully

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.570
about what the variables mean.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.560
OK.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.240
In that case, let's get
started on today's work,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.944
which is a change of gear.

00:07:59.944 --> 00:08:01.860
We're now going to be
talking about black body

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.060
radiation and its
effect on the universe.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.890
I should say that
my original plan was

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.990
to get into this set
of lectures notes--

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.710
lecture notes six, which have
not been handed out yet--

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.222
to get into those last time
and to finish them today.

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:16.930
I don't think that's
going to be possible

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.638
because I didn't get
into them last time,

00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:21.720
and I don't think I'll be
able to finish them today.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.710
But I would like today to be
sort of the closing for what's

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.010
needed for the problem set
due Monday and for the quiz

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.370
next week.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.710
So, shortly after
today's lecture

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.230
I will send you an
email telling you

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.630
where the cutoff is
as far as the reading

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.740
and the lecture notes.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.059
And I also hope to post the
lecture notes by tomorrow.

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.919
And I also will be posting
a set of review problems

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.770
as we had for quiz one.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.180
And I hope to get
that done by tomorrow.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.130
You may have noticed that not
all of my hopes are filled,

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.310
but I do my best, and I'll try.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.270
OK are there any logistic
questions or anything

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.760
before we go on?

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.680
Yes.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.520
AUDIENCE: Can you
post the solutions

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.901
to the previous
problem set, the one

00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:07.310
that we turned in on Friday?

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.310
PROFESSOR: Oh, um,
yes I can, I should.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.530
OK I will.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.010
OK, that's a third item I
should try to get done today.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.020
Thanks for reminding me.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.849
And the solutions
to the problem set

00:09:21.849 --> 00:09:23.390
that you'll be
handing in Monday will

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.264
be posted very shortly
after you hand them in

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.080
so that people can
start talking about them

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.070
and prepare for the quiz.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.570
Yes.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.285
AUDIENCE: Do we have any day at
which the videos might be up?

00:09:33.285 --> 00:09:35.660
PROFESSOR: Ah, I've request
about that and all I was told

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.250
was that they're
doing their best.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:43.510
So, I did look into it, but
I don't know the answer.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.867
I hope that you'll have all
the videos available to study

00:09:51.867 --> 00:09:54.200
for the quiz, but I don't
know if that's going to happen

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.699
or not.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.920
OK.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:26.287
in that case, the new topic
is Blackbody Radiation

00:10:26.287 --> 00:10:27.870
and the Early History
of the Universe.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.750
So far we've dealt
with a universe which

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.330
contains only
non-relativistic matter

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.460
and that, as we said
from the beginning,

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.160
describes our universe for
the bulk of its history.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.890
But in the early
period, the universe

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.580
was in fact dominated
by radiation,

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.390
as we will now be calculating.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.550
And in the more recent
period, the universe

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.129
is dominated by
dark energy, which

00:10:59.129 --> 00:11:00.920
we'll be talking about
immediately after we

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.090
finish talking about radiation.

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.070
So the important point here is
that even though we don't think

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.220
of light as having
mass, light certainly

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.640
has energy and
relativistically we

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.200
know that energy and
mass are equivalent.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.470
The key equation that actually
dominates today's lecture

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.610
is perhaps the most
famous equation physics,

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.260
E equals MC squared, energy
and mass are equivalent.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.689
And the numbers--
I'll just give you

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:33.980
some numbers for this equation.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.930
You've probably already
aware that the numbers

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.560
are kind of out of sight.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:45.190
One kilogram, a point
to that equation,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.390
is equivalent to-- I don't
have any figures to give you--

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:56.860
8.9876, in case you really want
to know it accurately, times 10

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.850
to the 16th, most important
to know the exponent there,

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.350
joules.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.284
And it's also perhaps
interesting to translate this

00:12:07.284 --> 00:12:08.700
into the kind of
energy units that

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.100
are use when we talk
about power consumption

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.350
in practical situations.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:33.240
It corresponds to 2.497 times
10 to the 10th kilowatt hours,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.720
which is a lot of
kilowatt hours.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.390
An interesting comparison, is
the total power consumption

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.040
of the world, which
turns out to be

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.320
comparable to a kilograms
worth of things.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.410
I looked things up
in the Wikipedia,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.460
and it told me that
in 2008-- which

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.300
is the most recent year
it had numbers for,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.940
which is a little surprising,
that's so far in the past--

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.300
the total world
power consumption

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:14.040
for the year equaled about,
I'm rounding off here,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.020
about 150 petawatt hours.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.820
Now, I always have to look
up peta when I see it,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.653
I haven't quite learned
what peta means yet.

00:13:28.653 --> 00:13:36.250
But they translated this, this
means 150 trillion kilowatt

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.430
hours.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:45.930
So 150 times 10 to the
12th kilowatt hours.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.370
And if we divide this by the
number of hours in the year--

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.475
to ask how much
is per hour, which

00:13:50.475 --> 00:13:52.850
is I think a natural thing to
think about if you're using

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.610
kilowatt hours to measure the
power, especially the energy--

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:05.290
the power that goes with
this is about 17 times 10

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.900
to the ninth kilowatts.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:18.250
And therefore 17 times 10 to
the 9th kilowatt hours per hour.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.080
And if you compare
these two numbers,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:27.910
it means that if you could
convert one kilogram per hour

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.110
into pure energy,
that would be about

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:51.680
equal to 1.5 times the
world's power usage in 2008.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.370
So if you could convert
matter completely to energy,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.780
as they do on Star
Trek, it would

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.590
mean that you could
fill up your tank

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.290
of your typical
American car and power

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.515
the world for about two days.

00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:08.850
But of course we
can't undo this,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.670
that's the important
fact concerning power.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:15.620
Only a small
fraction of the mass

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.010
of the uranium in
a nuclear reactor

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.050
is actually converted as
power, a fraction of a percent.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.730
So you don't get
nearly as much power

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.340
as this calculation
would indicate,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.790
but in principle
this much energy

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.620
is contained in the matter that
we have around us all the time.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.230
OK.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.896
I want to introduce
a few formulas which

00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.660
we'll be using sooner
or later concerning

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.190
the relativistic treatment
of momentum and energy,

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.940
which is what we're
getting into here.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.070
And we're not trying to derive
relativity in this course,

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.110
so I'm just trying to quote the
results that we'll be needing.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:16.910
So, it is useful to introduce
an energy momentum four-vector,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:22.680
which has a 0-th component
and an i-th component,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.280
where i refers to the
spatial indices 1, 2, and 3.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:32.130
And sometimes I might
write this as p zero p

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.050
with a vector sign over it,
where the vector sign indicates

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:36.750
the three components 1, 2, 3.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.340
The momentum here
is the momentum.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.415
It differs in its
relationship to velocity

00:16:45.415 --> 00:16:47.040
from what we have
from Newton, and I'll

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.880
write that in a minute,
but this momentum

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.330
is the conserved physical
momentum of an object.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.080
And p0 is also conserved.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:05.140
p0 is just an abbreviation
for the energy divided by C.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.630
And this quantity forms
a four dimensional

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.530
vector in special relativity.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.589
And when we say that
it's a four-vector,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.609
we're actually making
a definite statement

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:17.519
about how it transforms from
one Lorentz frame to another.

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:20.190
a four-vector is
something which transforms

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.890
in exactly the same way as x
super mu, four spatial and time

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:25.975
coordinates transform.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.410
And in particular,
we learned that there

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.040
was an invariant associated with
spacetime transformations this

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.530
s squared, which was x squared
plus y squared plus z squared

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.150
minus C squared t squared.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.170
And the same thing
will happen here.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:56.270
p squared, which means
the Lorentz invariant

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:08.000
square of the four-vector is the
Lorentz [INAUDIBLE] again here,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.880
and it's again equal to the
sum of the squares of the 3

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.450
spatial components minus the
square of the time component.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:34.280
And that can be written out as
the square of the momentum--

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.000
spatial momentum-- minus
E squared C squared.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.925
And the claim is that this
is also Lorentz invariant.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.670
And we could figure out what
Lorentz invariant quantity

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.511
it's equal to by
having knowledge

00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:10.010
that this is the
same in all frames.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.550
We can evaluate it in
the simplest frame.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.165
And the simplest frame would be
the rest frame of the object.

00:19:15.165 --> 00:19:17.290
In the rest frame of the
object the p would be zero

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:20.670
and this would then just be
minus E squared over C squared.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.800
E squared would be M
squared C to the fourth,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:36.810
so that implies that this is
equal to minus M0 C squared

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:43.960
squared where M0 is often
called the rest mass.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.030
And when I say it's often called
the the rest mass, what I mean

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.950
is that nobody ever
mistakes the word "rest

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.840
mass" to mean anything else,
if anybody says "rest mass,"

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.150
and he knows what he's
talking about, he means this.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.230
But this is often sometimes
just called the mass

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.440
because sometimes people
only talk about masses

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.714
as being rest masses.

00:20:06.714 --> 00:20:08.130
But I'll try to
call this the rest

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.780
mass because I will use the
word mass in other ways.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.130
We could also relate this
momentum to the velocity,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.220
and in doing that we will again
encounter this factor of gamma

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.900
that we found
kinematically earlier.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.083
AUDIENCE: Yes, question.

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:34.190
Did you forget to divide
by C squared there?

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:42.420
PROFESSOR: Um, yes.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.330
There's too many C's here.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.220
Absolutely.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.380
It should have
units of momentum.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.030
So it should have units of
mass times velocity squared.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.920
Thank you.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.420
Thank you.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:04.769
So, the quantity gamma,
is the same quantity

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:06.560
we encounter at the
beginning of the course

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.650
when we talked about
time dilation and Lorentz

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.070
contraction, it just depends
on the velocity and approaches

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.830
infinity as the velocity
approaches the speed of light.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.360
And the physical momentum of
a particle, relativistically

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.750
is equal to gamma
times M sub 0 times V.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:27.421
Where V is the ordinary
velocity-- this

00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:29.170
is special relativity,
we're not concerned

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:32.800
with coordinate velocity
versus physical velocity yet--

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.920
and gamma is that factor.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.040
So the momentum is larger than
what you would get a la Newton.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.260
The energy can also
be written down.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.480
And this formula
is one expression

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.285
we can use to find the energy
in terms of the momentum.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.570
The energy in terms
of the momentum

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:15.420
is M0 C squared squared
plus p squared C squared.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.830
And it also can be written
in terms of the velocity

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:22.610
as just gamma times M0 C squared
where the velocity appears

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.220
in the gamma.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:44.430
And a special case of this is
when the particle is at rest.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:49.660
Might as well write this, the
energy of a particle at rest,

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.180
which we might call E0, is just
M0 C squared, which gets us

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.350
back to where we started
with E equals MC squared.

00:23:01.624 --> 00:23:03.040
Now, I might just
say a quick word

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.946
about where these formulas come
from, what idea underlies them.

00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:07.320
I'm not going to
make any attempt

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.080
to derive them because
we just don't have time.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.510
It'd be easy to drive them,
but we want to do other things.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.550
But logically,
where they come from

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:20.650
is simply the observation,
by Einstein originally,

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.290
that if one has the Lorentz
transformations relating

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.260
what one inertial observer sees
to another inertial observer,

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.425
if one used those
transformations but used

00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:35.820
the Newtonian definitions
of energy and momentum,

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.430
then you would find immediately
that if energy and momentum

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.770
were conserved in one frame you
then know how to calculate what

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.210
happens in other frames by
using the transformations,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:47.220
you'd find it would not
be conserved other frames.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.710
So if the conservation
of energy and momentum

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:53.150
are to be a universal principle
of physics, which Einstein

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.080
wanted to maintain, it would
be necessary to redefine

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.630
energy and momentum.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.220
Now they're defined in
ways so that they approach

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.110
the Newtonian values
for small velocities,

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.030
but for velocities of the
order of the speed of light

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.000
they're different.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.734
And they have the property--
not completely obvious from what

00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:13.150
we wrote, well it is actually
completely obvious from what

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.780
we wrote-- they
have the property

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.770
that if it's
conserved in on frame,

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.420
it's conserved in all frames.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.291
And what makes it
obvious-- maybe

00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:23.290
the connections between
these different formulas

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.400
are not obvious--
but I did tell you

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.900
that p super mu transforms
as a four-vector,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.100
meaning it transforms the same
way as x super mu transforms,

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.030
which are linear
transformations.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.517
And that's enough to guarantee
that if p mu is conserved

00:24:38.517 --> 00:24:40.600
in one frame, it has to
be conserved in all frames

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.210
because delta p mu,
the change in p mu,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.815
would also be a four-vector,
and if a four-vector vanishes

00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:47.705
in one frame, it
vanishes in all frames.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.440
OK.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.773
Well I wanted to give you
sort of a quick example of how

00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:00.925
this works in practice.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.775
So I to just talk about the
energetics of a hydrogen atom.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.820
A hydrogen atom
consists of a proton,

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:38.582
with a mass that we'll call
M sub p, and an electron,

00:25:38.582 --> 00:25:40.040
with the mass that
we'll call M sub

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.680
E. And, as, if you imagine
starting with the electron

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.890
and proton arbitrarily far
apart and bring them together,

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.492
what you can discover
experimentally-- of if you know

00:25:53.492 --> 00:25:54.950
quantum mechanics
you can calculate

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:58.960
theoretically--
energy is released,

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.160
because you're releasing
potential energy as you

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.430
bring the electron
into the atom.

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:08.490
And the amount of
energy released

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:20.070
is 13.6 electron volts.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.220
And the important
E equals MC squared

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.010
implication which I
want to point out here

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.544
is that loss of energy.

00:26:26.544 --> 00:26:28.460
This energy would be
extracted from the system

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.192
as you made the hydrogen atom.

00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:32.400
The fact that you've extracted
energy from the system

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.530
means that now the system
should have less energy

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.314
than it had to start with.

00:26:36.314 --> 00:26:38.230
Initially it had the
rest energy of the proton

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.760
and the rest of electronic, M
sub p C squared and M sub E C

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.620
squared.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.530
Now it has less
energy by delta E,

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.250
and that means it also
has to have less mass.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.120
So the mass of a
hydrogen atom is not

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.190
the sum of the mass of
the proton and electron,

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.300
as it would be in
Newtonian mechanics,

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.940
but is less by an
amount proportional

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.717
to this energy given off,
delta E, 13.6 electron volts.

00:27:01.717 --> 00:27:03.300
And just putting in
the C squares in I

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.120
hope the right places, the
mass of a hydrogen atom

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.780
will be equal to
the mass of a proton

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.040
plus the mass of an
electron, but then

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:18.800
minus the binding energy
expressed in mass units-- delta

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:19.760
E over C squared.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:36.920
OK.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.900
So I guess, just
probably one more topic

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.940
I want to talk about in terms of
just basic special relativity,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.840
and this actually get's
into general relativity.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.190
I wanted to find the
relativistic mass

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:53.570
of any system just being its
energy divided by C squared.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.310
And this means that the
relativistic mass of a particle

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.960
increases with its velocity.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.060
The energy of a
single moving particle

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.280
is gamma times M0 C squared.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.940
That would say the
by this definition

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:15.390
the relativistic mass of that
particle is gamma times M0.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.390
And I might mention that this
concept of relativistic mass

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.410
is disparaged in many books
on special relativity.

00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:24.650
It's certainly a concept
that you can do without,

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.840
so people who emotionally
are bothered by it

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.720
can get along without
it because it is just

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.350
the energy divided by C squared.

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.750
And in fact a lot of work
in special relativity

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.150
is done in units
where C is equal to 1

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.060
and then it is just the energy.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.000
Especially if you
use C equals 1 you

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.245
could dispense with this
concept of relativistic mass.

00:28:44.245 --> 00:28:45.870
We're not going to
be using C equals 1,

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.940
so the phrase
relativistic mass will

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.650
allow us to abbreviate
E divided by E

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.460
squared in a convenient way.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.650
But the important thing
is not the definitions,

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.233
the important thing
is what properties

00:28:57.233 --> 00:28:59.400
does this relativistic
mass have,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.710
whether or not one chooses
to call it relativistic mass

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.920
or E divided by C squared.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.030
And it as an important
property concerning

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.980
the gravitational field
created by matter.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:15.420
Now the gravitational field
of a single moving object

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.130
is complicated.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.880
If we were talking
about, say, a moving star

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.440
that was moving at a
velocity large enough

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.947
so we care about relativity, the
way we calculate that actually

00:29:26.947 --> 00:29:28.947
as we start with the
Schwarzschild metric, which

00:29:28.947 --> 00:29:32.190
will describe the metric of
the star outside of the matter

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.310
if it were stationary.

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.101
And then you can just
make a transformation

00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:35.960
to a moving frame.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.501
You're allowed to
use any coordinates

00:29:37.501 --> 00:29:39.730
you want in general
relativity, so transforming

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.680
to coordinates that describe
the moving frame is no problem.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.480
But it distorts the field in a
complicated way, nonetheless,

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.330
a way that you can deal with.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.690
And what you find, of
course, is that what

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:56.590
you get would be asymmetric
once you transform to the moving

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.520
frame, it would show the
signs of the velocity

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.500
that you used to transform
from the original spherically

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.597
symmetric Schwarzschild
metric to the new frame.

00:30:06.597 --> 00:30:09.180
So the bottom line is that the
gravitational field of a moving

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.330
object is not isotropic, it's
more complicated than that,

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.310
just as the electric
field would be.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.860
But if we have a
gas of particles,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:24.160
which is pretty much what we
have in the early universe.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:35.290
If we have a gas of particles
in a box moving every which way,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.575
then if we thought of this
box as being an object

00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:40.700
that we're only going to
look at from the outside--

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.880
a black box in the
classic use of the phrase

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:51.320
black box-- the mass
of the black box

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:56.352
really would just be the sum
of the relativistic masses

00:30:56.352 --> 00:30:57.060
of the particles.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:05.300
And the isotropy of the metric
that any one particle would

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.670
generate would be canceled
by averaging or summing

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.230
over all the particles going
every which direction, because

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:17.162
on average the velocity of
particles inside the box is 0.

00:31:17.162 --> 00:31:19.620
So this relativistic mass, when
you're talking about a gas,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.780
really is the mass per particle.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.970
And if you divide
that by the volume

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.820
really you do get
the mass density,

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.720
which is a relevant
mass density in terms

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.960
of talking about how
this matter would

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.300
generate gravitational fields.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:33.800
Yes.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.299
AUDIENCE: So why
do some people have

00:31:35.299 --> 00:31:37.447
emotional problems with it?

00:31:37.447 --> 00:31:40.030
PROFESSOR: I think some people
have emotional problems with it

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.860
because when one thinks
about pedagogy in a course,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.900
for example, one worries
about people confusing it

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.067
with the rest mass.

00:31:49.067 --> 00:31:50.150
I think that's the reason.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.950
And I guess there are other
possible sources of confusion,

00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.020
so your question is a good one.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.340
Another source of confusion
is that this mass does not

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:04.679
fit into an F
equals ma equation.

00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:06.220
So in calling this
the mass you might

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.920
suggest to students who aren't
paying attention to every word

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.880
that you say, you might
go ahead and put F equals

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.440
ma for this mass,
that does not work.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.600
So it has some of the
properties of a mass,

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.369
but not-- by no
means all of them.

00:32:27.719 --> 00:32:29.260
But in particular
for us is important

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.634
because we're going to be
interested in the gravitational

00:32:31.634 --> 00:32:33.710
field of a gas
and then it really

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.730
is the mass that
determines that.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.950
In the more formal language
in general relativity,

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.182
it's the mass-- it's
the energy density, that

00:32:46.182 --> 00:32:48.640
appears in the equations that
produce gravitational fields,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.395
and then this really
is the energy density

00:32:50.395 --> 00:32:54.230
except for a factor
of C squared.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.020
OK, any questions?

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.680
Because now I'm going
to leave this formalism

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.921
and get into what role
this radiation could

00:33:02.921 --> 00:33:04.045
play in the early universe.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.106
So now I'd like to talk about
radiation in particular,

00:33:37.106 --> 00:33:39.450
and for now I mean
electromagnetic radiation

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.530
just ordinary photons.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.330
And we're not accustomed
to thinking of light

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:47.980
as having mass,
but we know light

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.740
has energy and energy is
related to mass by a factor of C

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.560
squared.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.000
So we can write down
the formula that

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.330
says that rho is equal to
u divided by C squared.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:02.940
Where u is the
energy density, which

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.525
we know electromagnetic
fields have.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.670
And rho will be the mass
density of radiation.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:57.810
Now, photons have
zero rest mass,

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.630
so if we apply for example
this formula for a photon

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.469
we would set M sub 0 equal to 0.

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:06.510
And we said that photons
have zero rest mass what

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.930
we mean is that
there's no lower limit

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.961
to the energy a photon can have.

00:35:11.961 --> 00:35:13.460
In general, the
rest mass determines

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:15.640
the lowest possible energy
a particle could have,

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.020
which is when it's at rest.

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.360
Photon can never
be rest and there's

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.990
no lower limit to what
its energy can be.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:36.390
So for photons, M0 is
equal to 0 and that

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:41.860
implies that the
energy of the photon

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.790
is just C times the
magnitude of its momentum.

00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:53.955
And this formula one can derive
just for electromagnetic waves

00:35:53.955 --> 00:35:56.130
is purely classical
EM-- you don't

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.057
have to be talking
about photons,

00:35:58.057 --> 00:36:00.390
but since it's true for a
classical electromagnetic wave

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.890
it had better also be true
for photons because we think

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.210
of this classical
electromagnetic waves

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:09.340
as really being
made out of photons.

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.520
So the energy that
exists in the universe

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.970
in the form of
electromagnetic radiation

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:18.230
will have an energy density,
which we know how to calculate.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.540
And we know to calculate the
momentum of any given photon.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.260
Now that will average
to zero, but nonetheless

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:28.010
if we imagine talking about
a box of photons, which

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.745
are bouncing off
the walls, the fact

00:36:29.745 --> 00:36:31.120
that each photon
carries momentum

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.030
means that there will be
a pressure on the walls.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.450
And we will be interested
in that pressure,

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:40.040
we'll be calculating a
formula for it in a minute.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.910
So, what we now
want to talk about

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:48.555
is what happens when we put a
photon gas into the universe

00:36:48.555 --> 00:36:49.930
and allow the
universe to expand.

00:37:24.326 --> 00:37:26.200
What happens to the
radiation energy density,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.960
or equivalently mass density,
as the universe expands?

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.260
This turns out to be
a very easy question

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:40.770
to answer if we
think of the energy

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.960
as being made out of photons.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.690
We would get an equivalent
identical answer

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:52.057
if we use classical
Maxwell's equations

00:37:52.057 --> 00:37:53.640
and talked about how
energy density is

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.954
a [INAUDIBLE] of
electromagnetic fields behaved.

00:37:55.954 --> 00:37:57.870
It would be more work
actually do it that way,

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.140
but we would get
the same answer.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.210
In terms of photos,
we could simply

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:09.010
notice that the number
density of photons-- photons

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.690
are not going to disappear
as the universe expands,

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.350
the number density
will just keep

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.160
the same number of photons,
but as the universe expands

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.172
those photons will
occupy a larger volume.

00:38:19.172 --> 00:38:20.630
So it's exactly
the same as what we

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.380
said about
non-relativistic matter,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.840
the number density of
photons will fall like 1

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.380
over the cube of the
scale factor, which just

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.035
says that photons are conserved.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.520
And the volume of any
region grows like a cubed.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.477
I should also mention
that I'm using gamma here.

00:38:49.477 --> 00:38:51.060
Gamma of course also
sometimes meant 1

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.435
over the square-root of 1
minus V squared over C squared,

00:38:53.435 --> 00:38:55.570
but besides that
use, gamma is also

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.340
just a label that means photons.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.820
It comes from the
idea of gamma rays,

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.180
but it's actually
used in this context

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.092
for any kind of a
photon no matter

00:39:08.092 --> 00:39:09.550
what its frequency
is, whether it's

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:13.010
a gamma ray or an x-ray or
visible light, or infrared.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.510
Yes.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.930
AUDIENCE: Is this
assumed for time average?

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.350
Because photons can
be absorbed, right?

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.286
I mean, at least like
in a small [? slice ?]

00:39:20.286 --> 00:39:23.680
can't there be a decided
non-relativistic matter?

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.090
PROFESSOR: Is this
true on the--?

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.650
Well, the validity of
this formula-- you're

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:32.130
right this formula's not
exact, photons can be absorbed.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:34.940
But in terms of what happens
as the universe evolves,

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.450
that's a very, very,
very minor process,

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.700
especially when we're talking
about the early universe

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:43.180
when there isn't really
anything around to absorb them.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.055
So, especially for the early
universe and even pretty well

00:39:46.055 --> 00:39:48.180
today, if we're talking
about the cosmic background

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.380
radiation, which is the
bulk of the photons,

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.390
this formula's a very
good approximation.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.890
Yes.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.320
AUDIENCE: Even though the
photons in the early universe

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.280
created a lot of
massive particles,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.710
[INAUDIBLE] didn't that
affect the expansion?

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.200
PROFESSOR: Are you're
asking, will the photons

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.540
be important if there's a
lot of mass of particles?

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:12.210
Is that your question?

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.835
AUDIENCE: Would the
photons, won't they

00:40:13.835 --> 00:40:17.060
decay into matter antimatter?

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.040
PROFESSOR: Will the photon
decay into matter antimatter?

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.860
No, not really.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.670
It is, in principle,
possible for two photons

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.750
to collide and produce an
electron positron pair.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.700
It's actually a rather small
cross section for that.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.510
And all of these processes
in the early universe

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.400
will rapidly reach
an equilibrium,

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.880
which we'll be talking about
more a little later, where

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.640
there'll be just as many
photons converting into E plus E

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.700
minus pairs as there will be
E plus E minus pairs colliding

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.220
and making photons.

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:55.360
So the early universe is
assumed to reach equilibrium

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:58.817
very quickly, and all the
description we'll be giving

00:40:58.817 --> 00:41:00.650
will be a description
of the universe that's

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:03.070
in thermal equilibrium
with these processes will

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.110
tend to iron out.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.610
We will learn that
they don't always

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.693
cancel each other because
the universe is cooling,

00:41:08.693 --> 00:41:11.935
and that means it can't be
exactly in thermal equilibrium.

00:41:11.935 --> 00:41:14.310
And there are some cases where
the effect of that cooling

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.700
is significant and we'll
be talking about those.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.750
But for the most part,
if the cooling is slow,

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.769
which it is for the most part
compared to other processes,

00:41:22.769 --> 00:41:24.435
everything stays in
thermal equilibrium.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.490
OK.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.190
Those are good questions.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.820
We've gotten a little ahead of
what I wanted to talk about.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.882
So for now I'm just
imagining a free photon gas,

00:41:33.882 --> 00:41:35.340
which is an excellent
approximation

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:36.964
for the early universe.

00:41:36.964 --> 00:41:38.630
And those photons
just continue to exist

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.300
as the universe expands,
so their number density

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.401
falls off as 1 over a cubed.

00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:45.900
But there's another
affect that goes

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.880
on which is that the
photons are redshifting.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.050
And we already know
about that, but now we're

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.720
going to take it into account
in terms of the energy balances.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:42:00.710
So we know that the frequency
of a photon at some time t2

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:05.410
divide by its frequency
at some time t1,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:16.530
and here nu equals
frequency, is just

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.820
diluted by the expansion
of the universe.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.040
This ratio is 1
over 1 plus z, where

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.050
z is the redshift
between these two times.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.670
But written out in
more detail which

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.880
is a formula we'll
actually be using,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.240
is just a of t1
divided by a of t2.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:42.290
When the scale factor doubles,
all the frequency is half.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.200
And that means that all
the photons are lowering

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.026
in frequency, and we also know
that photons are quantized.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.850
The energy of a photon
can't be any old thing,

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:12.620
but in fact, the energy of a
photon is equal to h times nu.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.705
Where little h is what's
called Planck's constant.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.420
And numerically there
are various units

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:56.950
you could express it
in, but it's 4.136 times

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:01.875
10 to the minus 15th
electron volt seconds.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.620
So if you measure a
frequency an inverse seconds,

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.875
you get an energy in electron
volts from that formula.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.475
The important thing
for now though is

00:44:19.475 --> 00:44:24.440
that this says that the
energy of each photon-- being

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.690
proportional to its frequency,
and the frequency being

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.760
proportional to 1 over
the scale factor--

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.950
the energy of each photons is
proportional to 1 over a of t.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.620
And then the total
energy density

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.610
of photons in
photon on gas which

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.360
I'll call u sub gamma, the
energy density of the gas,

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.940
can be thought of as the
number density of photons

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.440
times the energy of each photon.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.150
And the number
density is falling off

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.180
like 1 over a cubed, the energy
is falling off like 1 over a.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.170
And therefore, this
is proportional to 1

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:05.500
over a to the fourth.

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.020
So as the universe
expands, the density

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.230
of non-relativistic matter
falls off like 1 over a cubed--

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.060
as we've been talking
about some time now--

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.550
but the energy of
radiation falls off faster,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:26.110
like 1 over a to
the fourth because

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.568
of the red shifting
of the photons.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.170
OK, now once we know
this, we can ask ourselves

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.920
what happens if we look at
our universe going backwards,

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:07.440
knowing where we are
now where we come from?

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.340
And if the energy
density of photons

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:15.630
is falling off faster than
the energy density of matter,

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.750
it would mean that the
ratio is getting smaller

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:19.722
as we go forward in time.

00:46:19.722 --> 00:46:21.430
But that of course
implies that the ratio

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.397
gets larger as we go
backwards in time.

00:46:24.397 --> 00:46:26.230
So as we go backwards
in time, the radiation

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.610
becomes more and more
important, and there actually

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:32.590
is going to be a time when the
radiation will equal the matter

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:36.390
and at earlier times the
radiation will dominate.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.300
Today I'll just give
you a number for now,

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.990
we'll learn later
how to calculate it,

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.440
but for today the
total radiation energy

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:54.100
density in the universe
is equal to 7.01 times 10

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.885
to the minus 14 joules
per meter cubed.

00:47:07.162 --> 00:47:09.245
And this actually includes
two kinds of radiation,

00:47:09.245 --> 00:47:14.980
it includes photons
and also neutrinos,

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:17.220
which at least in
the early universe

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.057
behaved just like radiation.

00:47:20.057 --> 00:47:22.640
And we'll be talking more about
neutrinos later so don't worry

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.820
if you don't have any
idea what a neutrino is.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.090
But for now it's just another
contribution to the radiation,

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.494
and we can measure
basically this is all

00:47:34.494 --> 00:47:35.910
based on measuring
the temperature

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:38.007
of the cosmic microwave
background radiation--

00:47:38.007 --> 00:47:40.090
and we'll learn later how
to make that conversion.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.140
But once you measure
the temperature

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.530
of the cosmic
background radiation

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.010
and have a theory about how
many neutrinos there should be,

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:46.718
that's actually all
theoretical and we'll

00:47:46.718 --> 00:47:48.320
talk about that later as well.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.730
One can determine
what the energy

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:54.310
density of that radiation is.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:48:02.270
And it corresponds to a mass
density just dividing by C

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:13.030
squared of 7.80 times 10 to the
minus 31 kilograms per meter

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.234
cubed.

00:48:14.234 --> 00:48:15.650
And when I think
of mass densities

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:19.020
I always like to think of in
centimeters per-- excuse me,

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.684
grams per centimeter
cubed because I'm

00:48:21.684 --> 00:48:24.100
used to the density of water
being one gram per centimeter

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.420
cubed and I like to be able
to make that comparison.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.220
So just making that conversion,
usually I use SI units,

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.090
but some things just seem to
make more sense in other units.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:41.026
So it's 10 to the minus 34
grams per centimeter cubed,

00:48:41.026 --> 00:48:44.270
so 10 to the minus 34, or
maybe 10 to the minus 33,

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.260
times the density of water.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.130
And this is incredibly
low even compared

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.260
to the critical density
of our universe,

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:54.710
and the actual
density we know is

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.020
very near this critical density.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.800
Let me remind you that
the critical density

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.180
we derived a formula for,
and when we put numbers

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.050
into that formula
we found that was

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:10.310
equal to 1.88 times
little h0 squared,

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.670
which is Hubble's units--
Hubble's constant in units

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.820
of 100 kilometers per
second per megaparsec--

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.830
I'll write that in
a second-- times 10

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:25.605
to the minus 29 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:48.770
So just writing down the
equation for little h sub 0

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:54.390
is where capital H sub 0,
Hubble's expansion rate,

00:49:54.390 --> 00:50:02.320
is equal to 100
times little h sub 0

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:07.150
kilometers per second
per megaparsec.

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:17.298
Yep.

00:50:17.298 --> 00:50:20.868
AUDIENCE: What's
the, I guess, what's

00:50:20.868 --> 00:50:23.010
the motivation of
normalizing the Hubble

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.930
constant in this way?

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.900
PROFESSOR: Well, I think
the real motivation is

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.780
that the astronomers like these
peculiar units of kilometers

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.230
per second per megaparsec, but
if your favorite unit is called

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.740
a kilometer per
second per megaparsec

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:39.670
you don't want to have to
say those units very often.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:42.600
So H0 is dimensionless, so
it's a dimensionless way

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.160
of talking about
the Hubble constant.

00:50:49.006 --> 00:50:50.630
But that's the only
importance, there's

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.930
no real-- no deep
significance to it.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:56.750
But it's a standard notation,
so it's worth knowing.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:51:02.820
And then finally,
we can write down

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:10.320
how much the radiation
contributes to omega-- omega

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.510
sub r, r is going to
indicate radiation.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:17.164
The notation, by
the way, will be--

00:51:17.164 --> 00:51:19.390
and I realized I've already
violated that notation.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:22.551
This really should have been r.

00:51:22.551 --> 00:51:26.410
Well, I'm not going to change
it, it'll get too messy.

00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.080
But I'm going to start using the
notation where gamma indicates

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.199
photons and little r
indicates radiation.

00:51:32.199 --> 00:51:34.740
And the difference is that there
are other kinds of radiation

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.130
besides photons, in
particular we've already

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:41.020
added in neutrinos in part of
what we're calling radiation.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:44.190
So omega sub r, which now
includes photons and neutrinos,

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:47.560
is just defined to be the
mass density radiation divided

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.650
by the critical density.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.830
And that turns out, when
you combine these numbers,

00:51:52.830 --> 00:52:00.035
to be 4.15 times 10 to the minus
5 little h0 to the minus 2.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:13.230
And then for h0 equals 0.67,
which is the Planck satellite

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:17.460
value for little
h0, we finally get

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:28.270
omega sub r is equal to 9.2
times 10 to the minus 5.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.500
So roughly 10 to the minus 4.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:33.110
The fraction of the mass
density, or energy density

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:39.020
today is about 10 to the minus
4 fraction and radiation.

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.620
And actually as I write
this, this actually

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:46.000
calls to mind another reason for
defining little h sub 0, which

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.920
is that if you write formulas
in terms of little h sub 0,

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.640
they remain valid between
one year and next year.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.100
The observational value
of the Hubble parameter

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.510
is still floating
around and differs,

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:00.800
for example, every time
I teach this course.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.640
So the formulas in
terms of little h sub 0

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.380
stay, and then you plug in the
current value of little h sub 0

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:12.250
to get the best value that
one can currently write down.

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:16.135
Now we know the Hubble constant
to within a few percent, which

00:53:16.135 --> 00:53:18.960
is much better than it used to
be, but it's still floating.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.340
The Planck value was somewhat
lower than the previous except

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:28.520
a value, which was about 0.70.

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.430
OK.

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:34.400
So we know enough information
to extrapolate backwards

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.120
and calculate when
this radiation would've

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.960
equaled the energy
density of matter.

00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:57.250
Because we know how
the ratio changes.

00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.740
It changes by a factor
of a, the scale factor,

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.130
because the energy density
of non-relativistic matter

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.892
is falling off like
1 over a cubed.

00:54:03.892 --> 00:54:06.100
The energy density of
radiation is flowing off like 1

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.240
over a to the fourth.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.340
So the ratio between
them just changes

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:15.260
by a factor of a,
decreasing as a gets larger.

00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:23.390
So we can write RHO radiation
of t divided by RHO matter of t.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.750
The m there means
non-relativistic matter.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:46.640
This is just equal
to the current value.

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:52.290
And the current value is
gotten by taking that number

00:54:52.290 --> 00:55:02.320
and, where I forgot to write
down is that omega matter today

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:09.780
is about 0.30.

00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:16.960
So the ratio of the two, omega
radiation over omega matter,

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:24.000
which is the same as RHO
radiation over RHO matter,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:35.380
is about 3.1 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.160
And that number is about
to appear in this equation.

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:44.280
If we want the ratio
as a function of time,

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:51.500
we start with this value today,
3.1 times 10 to the minus 4,

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:56.050
and then we can just multiply
that by the scale factor

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:59.710
today divided by the
scale factor at the time

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:02.410
that we want to know it, because
we know it falls off as 1

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:03.420
over the scale factor.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.090
And by putting an a
of t0 here, this just

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:11.840
guarantees that if
we let t equal t0,

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.630
we get this number, which is
the right ratio for today.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.380
OK.

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:25.250
Now it's just a
matter of arithmetic.

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:37.090
We also know that for a
matter-dominated universe.

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:42.910
And for now, we're going to
estimate when the radiation

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.881
energy will equal
the matter density.

00:56:44.881 --> 00:56:46.130
This will only be an estimate.

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.713
We're going to
estimate it by assuming

00:56:47.713 --> 00:56:50.230
that we can approximate the
universe as matter dominated

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:55.500
between now, all the way
back until that time.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.110
There are two errors
in that calculation.

00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.600
We're not taking into account
here the era of acceleration

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.600
where dark energy is
playing a significant role.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.110
We'll learn later
how to do that.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.110
And also, as we approach
this time when they're

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.960
making equal contributions,
we will run into a regime

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.050
where the contribution
of the radiation

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:14.930
itself will be relevant.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:17.310
So this is only an estimate.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.257
But what we're
going to do is we're

00:57:20.257 --> 00:57:21.840
going to assume that
we can treat this

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.530
as a matter-dominated universe
with a of t proportional

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.524
to the 2/3.

00:57:28.524 --> 00:57:30.440
And then we can plug
numbers into this formula

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.960
and ask, when was the ratio 1?

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.720
And when the ratio
was 1, we call

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:39.100
that the time of equality, using
the subscript EQ for equality

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.110
to indicate anything having to
do with that crossing point.

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:49.590
And what we find is
that the z of equality,

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:57.085
and z is just the ratio
of the a's, is-- according

00:57:57.085 --> 00:58:01.120
to this calculation, it
would be 3.1 times 10

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:05.230
to the minus 4 minus 1.

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:07.604
I fibbed when I said that
z is the ratio of the a's.

00:58:07.604 --> 00:58:08.770
It's offset by a little bit.

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:11.470
It's 1 plus z that's
the ratio of the a's.

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.440
And that's why there's
a minus 1 there.

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:19.900
And numerically, this is
about equal to 32,000.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.670
So if we look back in the
history of the universe,

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:26.870
we can define looking back
in terms of the redshift.

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:31.650
If you look back to a redshift
of 3,200, we get to the time

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.210
when matter and radiation
had the same energy density.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.916
And we can know what time
that is if we assume t

00:58:41.916 --> 00:58:44.966
to the 2/3, which again is
only a crude approximation.

00:58:44.966 --> 00:58:47.340
We don't necessarily expect
to get the right answer here.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:49.423
But we expect to get the
right order of magnitude.

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:02.500
So t-equality, according
to this situation,

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:21.100
would be about 75,000 years
after the Big Bang-- just

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.150
converting the scale
factor that we just

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.823
calculated to a time using that
formula, treating this as t

00:59:26.823 --> 00:59:29.000
to the 2/3.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.080
So this says that about
75,000 years after the Big

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:35.341
Bang, the energy densities
of matter and radiation

00:59:35.341 --> 00:59:35.840
were equal.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.256
In the earlier
times, the universe

00:59:37.256 --> 00:59:38.420
was radiation dominated.

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:41.521
The radiation exceeded the
matter in its energy density.

00:59:41.521 --> 00:59:42.020
Yes?

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.020
AUDIENCE: It seems like
zEQ is relatively about 31

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:45.520
[INAUDIBLE].

00:59:52.404 --> 00:59:54.320
PROFESSOR: You might be
right if we would just

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.278
look to these formulas.

00:59:55.278 --> 00:59:57.460
When I calculated
this at home, I

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.170
kept more decimal
places all the way

00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:03.120
and rounded off each answer
to one significant figure.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.750
And that's not the same as
taking the answer to one

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.380
significant figure
and calculating

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.320
and then rounding off
to ones in every figure.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.610
So I think there's always an
ambiguity of, roughly speaking,

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.794
1 in the last decimal
place whenever

01:00:15.794 --> 01:00:16.960
you're rounding numbers off.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.932
AUDIENCE: So we just
plug that [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.572
PROFESSOR: 3,220--
starting with this

01:00:25.572 --> 01:00:27.780
or starting with a more
accurate number than the 3.1.

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.780
AUDIENCE: Just 1/3.1.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.660
PROFESSOR: 1/3.1.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.160
OK.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.370
So, OK?

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.256
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:37.238
AUDIENCE: Wait no,
[INAUDIBLE] like we have 1

01:00:37.238 --> 01:00:38.585
over 3 times 10 negative 4.

01:00:38.585 --> 01:00:40.040
That's 3 times 10--

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.156
PROFESSOR: It's 3.1.

01:00:41.156 --> 01:00:42.560
AUDIENCE: You have 1 over 3.1.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.476
PROFESSOR: 1 over 3.1.

01:00:43.476 --> 01:00:44.747
So you have to divide.

01:00:44.747 --> 01:00:46.118
AUDIENCE:I do that all the time.

01:00:46.118 --> 01:00:48.414
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:48.414 --> 01:00:50.080
PROFESSOR: So apparently
it's even right

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.100
if you just calculate with that.

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.300
But there is actually
some ambiguity.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:57.630
The numbers I'm
giving you probably

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.620
have some uncertainty
of 1 in the last digit,

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.880
depending on how you calculate.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.610
But the number they
give you, I think

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:08.600
they're the ones that
you get if you start

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.524
using this and the 0.67 and
from then on do everything

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:14.940
to large numbers
in decimal places

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:16.280
and round off at each stage.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.639
You'll get the numbers
I've given you.

01:01:18.639 --> 01:01:20.430
In any case, all these
are really, at best,

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:21.450
order of magnitude estimates.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:24.110
So worrying about whether or
not the last figure is accurate

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.570
is not a big deal.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:27.737
Yes?

01:01:27.737 --> 01:01:29.195
AUDIENCE: I don't
really understand

01:01:29.195 --> 01:01:32.093
how you got t [INAUDIBLE]
without telling was a of t dot

01:01:32.093 --> 01:01:33.059
is [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:36.500
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.166
There is actually a
piece of information

01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:39.520
I used I forgot to write here.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.140
You're absolutely right.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:46.654
I used t0 is equal to 13.8
times 10 to the nine years.

01:01:46.654 --> 01:01:48.320
And then everything
can be related to t0

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.214
if you know how things
are proportional to t.

01:01:51.214 --> 01:01:52.130
You're absolute right.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:53.910
I did not give you
all the information

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.201
necessary for that calculation.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:58.940
Now I think I have.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.000
I haven't done the
arithmetic for you.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.361
But otherwise it's all there.

01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:04.860
OK.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:10.960
Now I might mention
that in Ryden's book,

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.610
she does the calculation taking
into account everything--

01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:17.660
matter, radiation,
cosmological constants.

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:28.100
And her number for
t-equality is 47,000 years,

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.980
which verifies that we have
the right order of magnitude.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.480
And actually, the
biggest difference

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.840
between her number
and my number is not

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.090
that she's taken into account
these more sophisticated

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:39.330
things, but rather that
she used a different value

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.604
for the Hubble expansion
rate than I'm using.

01:02:41.604 --> 01:02:44.020
She's using a value that was
current at the time she wrote

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.350
her book, which was
like '72, I think.

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:50.339
h0 equals 0.72 instead
of [INAUDIBLE] 0.67.

01:02:50.339 --> 01:02:52.380
And that does make a
significant difference here.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.700
But either of these numbers
are, I think, probably

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:00.420
within the range of uncertainty
of when it really happened.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:05.450
But it's on that scale, on the
scale of 50,000 years, 100,000

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:08.980
years, something of that order.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.260
So there was a
significantly long period

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.260
compared to human lifetime
when the universe was

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.630
radiation dominated.

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.340
But it's a very small fraction
of the overall history

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:18.970
of the universe,
but nonetheless does

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:23.340
have important features that
happened during that time

01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:23.970
period.

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.860
Now, if we want to
understand those features,

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.290
we have to understand how a
radiation-dominated universe

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:31.830
evolves, which is what
we're going to get to next.

01:03:48.641 --> 01:03:49.140
OK.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.724
The next little
chapter than I'm going

01:03:50.724 --> 01:03:56.600
to be talking
about-- the dynamics

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.295
of a radiation-dominated
universe.

01:04:09.895 --> 01:04:11.520
This is a chapter
that you more or less

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.487
get to work out the
equations for yourself

01:04:13.487 --> 01:04:14.820
on one of the homework problems.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.780
That's part of this week's set.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:21.460
So I will try here
to outline the logic.

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:24.550
But because all the calculations
are in the homework,

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:28.300
I will basically skip the
calculations themselves,

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.340
and let you do
them for yourselves

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.460
as part of the homework.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:41.670
But where we start is we have
written down Friedman equations

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.730
for the matter-dominated case.

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:46.095
And I'll start by reminding
us what those were.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.870
And then in addition to
these two equations, which

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.120
describe our expanding universe,
which we've derived sometime

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.540
ago for-- and to
remind us here, this

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.035
is for a matter-dominated
universe.

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.070
And matter-dominated means
non-relativistic matter

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.400
dominated.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.230
And going along with
these equations,

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:38.970
we also know that RHO of t
for non-relativistic matter

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:42.340
falls off like one
over a cubed of t.

01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:50.740
This can be converted into a
differential equation for RHO.

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.840
That is, we can calculate
Rho dot from this equation.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.270
And the way to see that
is probably most easily

01:05:57.270 --> 01:06:06.410
to start on a new blackboard
and write that equation not as

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.620
a proportionality, since
it's hard to differentiate

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.575
a proportionality,
but we can write it

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:13.430
in an arbitrary constant
of proportionality.

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:15.490
And then it becomes an equality.

01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.080
So I'm going to write
the equation as RHO of t

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:23.680
is equal to some constant,
b, divided by a cubed of t.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.890
And this we know how
to differentiate.

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:29.850
We can write Rho dot is
equal to minus b over a

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:33.050
to the fourth of t times a dot.

01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:41.060
And that is equal to minus 3.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.360
I'm sorry--there's a 3 here.

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.130
Minus 3 times a dot over
a times the original RHO.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:53.860
So we can forget the
intermediate steps,

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.860
and we just arrived
at the equation

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:01.756
that RHO dot is equal to minus
3 a dot over a times RHO.

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.380
And we can think of
that as going along

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:05.630
with equations one and two.

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.850
Maybe I'll even
give that a number.

01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:10.770
Equation three
will be RHO dot is

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:15.285
equal to minus 3 a
dot over a times RHO.

01:07:18.850 --> 01:07:21.970
Now for radiation,
there will be a 4 here.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.540
The 4 will arrive the same
way as the 3 arrives there.

01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:28.740
It's just the power that
appeared in the factor of a.

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.540
So for radiation, this
last formula we know

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:33.480
is going to be modified,
which is the key point.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.920
Note that these three
formulas are not

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.750
independent of each other.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.050
If we know, for example,
equation one, which

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:44.006
is an equation for
a dot, we could

01:07:44.006 --> 01:07:45.630
differentiate that
with respect to time

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:47.980
and get an equation
for a double dot.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.120
When we do that, everything
has to be differentiated.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.390
So it involves
differentiating a,

01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:57.170
but that just expresses things
in terms of derivatives of a.

01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.980
But the new quantity that
gets introduced is RHO.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.570
If we wanted to differentiate
this equation with respect

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:06.300
to time, we have to
know what RHO dot is.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.130
But we do.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:09.850
That's what equation
three tells us.

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:13.620
So we can differentiate equation
one, use equation three,

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.661
and we can derive an
equation for a double dot.

01:08:15.661 --> 01:08:17.244
And if these equations
are consistent,

01:08:17.244 --> 01:08:18.500
it'd better be equation two.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.279
And it will be.

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.500
You can check it.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.790
And actually, I think any
two of these equations

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:25.760
can be used to derive the third.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.414
Those equations
just are-- really

01:08:27.414 --> 01:08:28.830
a set of two
independent equations

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.640
and one dependent equation.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.210
You can shuffle it
any way you want.

01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:39.340
But, now what we want
to do is to consider

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:40.779
a different kind of matter.

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:42.380
Instead of
non-relativistic matter,

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.569
we're considering photon matter.

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:47.210
And in particular,
we know that it's

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.615
going to change equation three.

01:08:56.939 --> 01:09:01.220
So for radiation,
3 gets modified

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:10.620
into 3 prime, which
is the equation that

01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:16.890
says that RHO dot is equal to
minus 4 a dot over a times RHO.

01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:41.010
So how are we going to
fix these equations?

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.080
Now they're inconsistent.

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.521
If we change three and don't
change either one or two,

01:09:46.521 --> 01:09:48.520
we know that we're
inconsistent, because any two

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:51.649
of those equations can be
used to derive the third.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:53.210
So we're in trouble.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:55.230
Either equations
one or two will also

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:58.260
have to be modified if we're
going to modify equation three.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.160
OK.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.040
Before we go on, I'd like to
say a little more about why

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.032
this equation is different
from that equation.

01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:24.490
One might think
that it should just

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:26.412
be governed by the
conservation of energy.

01:10:26.412 --> 01:10:28.120
After all, we just
write down an equation

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.540
for RHO dot-- how energy
density changes with time.

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.030
Shouldn't conservation
of energy determine that?

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:36.850
It does.

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:39.660
But there is an extra element
to conservation of energy

01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:42.950
that we need to
take into account,

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.540
and that is the pressure
of the gas affects

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.510
what happens to its
energy as it expands.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.470
So before we get back
to the early universe,

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:52.680
I just want to consider a
gas in a piston chamber.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:01.990
And I'm going to let the piston
have an area a, and inside

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:05.750
we're going to have a volume
v. Just to define our notation.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:11.340
If we have a gas
inside a piston chamber

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:15.390
and let the piston chamber
enlarge by pulling out

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:21.330
on the piston, the gas has
a pressure, in general,

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:24.570
and that pressure will
exert a force on the piston.

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.910
So if I allow the piston
to move to the right,

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:30.150
that gas will be
exerting a force

01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:32.680
on the piston in the
direction that it's moving.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:35.920
And that means the gas will
be doing work on the piston.

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.080
So, by our ordinary notions
of Newtonian conservation

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:43.310
of energy, we would know that
the gas would lose energy,

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:47.490
and we can even calculate
how much energy it loses.

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:51.870
And the formula is easy enough
to get in a Newtonian context.

01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:55.280
It's just du is equal
to minus the pressure

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.970
of the gas times the
change in volume.

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:00.550
A famous formula.

01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:02.550
And this just comes
about by saying

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:06.040
that the work that's done is
the force times the distance.

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.850
The force is the
pressure times the area.

01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.710
And the volume is the
area times the distance.

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:14.460
And putting those
things together,

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.204
you get this
formula immediately.

01:12:16.204 --> 01:12:18.120
Now this formula is
actually much more general

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.310
than the quasi derivation
that I just showed.

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:23.750
It works no matter what
the shape of the gas is.

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:25.740
If you put a gas in
any kind of a container

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:31.560
and let that container enlarge,
even in an irregular way,

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.770
the work that the gas
will do will always

01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.620
be equal to minus the
pressure of the gas

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:39.144
times the change in the volume.

01:12:39.144 --> 01:12:40.810
We can apply this to
the early universe.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:43.780
It actually works.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.455
The difference
between our two cases

01:12:45.455 --> 01:12:48.696
is that our non-relativistic
matter has no pressure at all.

01:12:48.696 --> 01:12:50.820
We're just talking about
particles sitting at rest.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.420
They're not bouncing
off of any walls.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.249
They're not creating
any pressure,

01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:56.290
while the photons are
moving around all the time.

01:12:56.290 --> 01:12:57.820
And if you imagine
a box of them,

01:12:57.820 --> 01:12:59.820
they'd be hitting against
the walls of that box,

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:00.680
exerting a pressure.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:08.170
And we're now in a position
to relate the pressure

01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:11.460
to the difference between
the 3's and the 4's that

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.955
appear in those two equations
for RHO dot in the two cases.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.190
To apply this naive idea
to a piece of the universe,

01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:36.800
we can imagine choosing-- we're
going to choose some fixed

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:42.370
volume in our co-moving
coordinate system.

01:13:53.842 --> 01:13:55.800
So our box, the volume
that we're talking about

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.633
will actually be expanding
with the universe

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.900
but be fixed in
co-moving coordinates.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:08.410
And the physical volume
therefore of our box

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:13.590
will be a cubed of t times
the coordinate volume

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:18.560
of the box-- the volume
and not just cubed.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.610
And this volume will
be independent of time.

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:21.911
There's time dependents there.

01:14:21.911 --> 01:14:23.160
There's time dependents there.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.225
The physical volume of
our box will be enlarging.

01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:33.540
The total energy in our
box, the total gas energy,

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.840
which I'll call
capital U, will just

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.180
be the physical volume
times the energy density.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.530
The energy density is
energy per physical volume.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:50.660
And we can now
apply this formula

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:55.000
using this U and this v.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.076
And here again is one
of these cases where

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:58.950
I'm going to be skipping
steps because you're

01:14:58.950 --> 01:15:01.160
going to be doing it in
detail on the homework.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:03.140
But by putting these
equations together,

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:08.680
what you'll find is that d dt
of a cubed times RHO times c

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:14.080
squared-- this is just d dt
of a cubed times the energy

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:18.170
density-- basically,
the left hand side

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:25.890
of that equation divided by dt
and divided by v coordinates--

01:15:25.890 --> 01:15:32.881
is equal to minus p
times d dt of a cubed.

01:15:32.881 --> 01:15:35.130
And this is just the PDV
term from the right hand side

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:38.117
of that equation rewritten
in terms of the variables.

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:39.700
And you'll be doing
this for homework.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.609
I'm just getting
straight the factors

01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:43.900
to make sure I have them right.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:15:58.520
OK.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.311
Reshuffling that
equation-- and again, this

01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:02.140
is a homework problem--
you can turn that

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:04.590
into an equation for RHO dot.

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:09.120
And what you'll get
is minus 3 a dot

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:15.420
over a times RHO plus
p over c squared.

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:27.110
And now we can see how
our two cases emerge.

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:29.134
If the pressure is 0,
we get minus 3 a dot

01:16:29.134 --> 01:16:30.550
over 8 times RHO,
which is what we

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:32.700
had for non-relativistic matter.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.660
And the photon gas is
going to have a pressure,

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.285
and we could read
off from this formula

01:16:36.285 --> 01:16:39.370
to know what the pressure has
to be to turn the 3 into a 4.

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:44.290
The pressure has to be
a factor of a third.

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:46.810
So you determine for this
that the pressure for light

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:53.050
is 1/3 of the energy density,
or 1/3 times RHO c squared.

01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:55.869
And that's what you need
to turn the 3 into a 4.

01:16:55.869 --> 01:16:57.910
So we now have indirectly
calculated the pressure

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:00.076
of light, and this agrees
with any other calculation

01:17:00.076 --> 01:17:03.090
for the pressure of
light that you might do.

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:05.670
It's by no means the
only way to calculate it.

01:17:05.670 --> 01:17:09.060
And now finally,
we're in a position--

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.200
and we'll just do
this quickly to decide

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.920
how to modify these equations.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.690
Now, we're not in a position
to determine that rigorously.

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:20.410
It can be determined rigorously
by doing general relativity,

01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:23.800
which we're not
doing at that level.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.690
But we can still
motivate the answer.

01:17:26.690 --> 01:17:28.360
One of these two
equations is going

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.850
to have to be changed
to accommodate

01:17:30.850 --> 01:17:34.470
a more general
expression for RHO dot.

01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:36.740
The top equation
we know is really

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.030
an equation for
conservation of energy.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.930
That's how we got it
in the Newtonian case

01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:46.110
where little k ended up
being partial to the energy

01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:47.640
in the Newtonian case.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.140
But this is basically
a conservation

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.440
of energy equation.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.120
And that's what you
expect, just given

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.290
your general notion
of mechanics as well.

01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:57.560
If you have a second
order equation,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.930
a second order differential
is with respect to time.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.110
That's the force equation.

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:02.860
And if you have a first
order differential

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:06.010
equation with respect to time,
1/2 mv squared plus v of r

01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:07.070
equals constant.

01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:09.300
That's energy conservation.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.250
Same thing here.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:13.910
And we know that energy
cannot suddenly change.

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:18.780
If we imagine-- I guess the
first experiment I want to do

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.730
is imagining somehow
there's an explosion

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.920
throughout all of space.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:27.670
I imagine putting pieces
of TNT throughout space

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.560
and arranging for, at the same
cosmic time, for all of them

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.200
to be ignited.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.014
And that would suddenly change
the pressure of the universe,

01:18:34.014 --> 01:18:35.805
but it would not change
the energy density.

01:18:35.805 --> 01:18:38.662
The energy density
would be conserved.

01:18:38.662 --> 01:18:40.620
So the bottom line is
that pressures can change

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:43.950
discontinuously, but
energy densities cannot.

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:48.640
And since this equation is
the conservation of energy

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.660
equation, we'd expected that
nothing can change suddenly

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.050
here, that the pressure
term cannot contribute here,

01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:56.574
because if it did, the pressure
term would changed suddenly.

01:18:56.574 --> 01:18:58.740
Nothing else in this equation
would change suddenly.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.350
There would be no way the
equation could be satisfied.

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:05.130
But if we added a pressure
term to the second equation,

01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:08.900
that would allow the pressure
to change discontinuously

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:10.135
as the TNT went off.

01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:12.260
And that would change a
double dot discontinuously.

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:14.530
And there's nothing wrong
with a double dot changing

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:15.350
discontinuously.

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:17.780
If you suddenly the apply
a new force to a particle,

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:21.350
you suddenly change its second
derivative of its motion.

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:23.500
You suddenly change
its acceleration.

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.510
So that's OK.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.690
So any pressure to
this term make sense.

01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:29.490
Adding pressure to this
equation does not make sense.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:31.370
And then we can just
ask, what do you

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:33.910
have to do to this equation if
we're going to add a pressure

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:36.280
term to make all
three equations now

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.220
consistent with the new
equation for RHO dot?

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.970
It's your homework problem
to answer that question,

01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:44.949
but the homework
tells you the answer,

01:19:44.949 --> 01:19:46.990
and I'll write the answer
on the board right now,

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:50.830
and then we'll consider
today's lecture over.

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:57.840
The bottom line is that
equation number one

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.750
has to be modified
into one prime, which

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.930
says that equation number
two has to be modified.

01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:06.960
What am I talking about?

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:17.890
And the new equation
is a double dot

01:20:17.890 --> 01:20:23.600
is equal to minus 4
pi over 3 G times RHO

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.880
plus 3p over c squared times a.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:37.070
And now we have a consistent
set of Friedman equations,

01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:38.570
and these are the
Friedman equations

01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:40.790
that we would have gotten
if we had done everything

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:43.330
using general relativity
from the beginning.

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:44.870
And we'll stop there.

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:49.380
And we will meet
again next Tuesday.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:51.170
And I'll send you an
email about-- there

01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:54.575
will be at least one homework
problem on the problems set

01:20:54.575 --> 01:20:58.446
that will have to be held over
to the following problems set.

01:20:58.446 --> 01:20:59.820
I'll send you an
email about that

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.960
and post it on the website.
