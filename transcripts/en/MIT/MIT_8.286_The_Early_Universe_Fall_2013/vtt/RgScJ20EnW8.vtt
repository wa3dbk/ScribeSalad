00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:27.040
PROFESSOR: OK, in that case,
let's begin in our usual way

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.450
by going through a review
of last time's lecture.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.960
Last time, we talked
really about two

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.980
calculational problems.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.520
One was the calculation of
the age of the universe,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.640
taking into account a
universe model which

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.550
has matter, radiation,
vacuum energy, and curvature.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.870
And we got the general formula.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.230
And then for the same type
of cosmological model,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.850
we also calculated how
one finds the brightness

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.860
of a distant source--
the energy flux in terms

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.750
of the redshift of that source.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.750
So first, the age of the
universe calculation--

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.310
that really just depends on the
first-order Friedman equation,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.740
which I've rewritten here.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.580
We put three terms
on the right hand

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.070
side for the mass density-- a
matter term, a radiation term,

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.010
and a vacuum energy term.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.690
And we know-- and this is
the important ingredient--

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.420
we know how each depend
on the scale factor.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420
Non-relativistic
matter falls off like 1

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.630
over the cube of
the scale factor.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.110
Radiation falls off like
1 over the fourth power

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.580
of the scale factor.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.830
And vacuum energy
is just constant.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.360
Next step that we did was just
to rewrite this equation, where

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.260
we put in the explicit
time dependence

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.780
in the form of this x
which is the ratio of a

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.780
of t to the present value of
the scale factor-- a of t 0.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080
And furthermore, we
expressed the matter density

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.960
in terms of the present
contribution to omega.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.720
And rewriting equation in that
language, it takes that form.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.490
And then, I pulled a fast one.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.020
I said we could also
write this last term

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.560
to look pretty much
like the others.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
It just is a constant that
falls off like 1 over a squared.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.740
So if you define
omega sub k 0, which

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.940
is exactly what you need to
make this look like that,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.140
and in terms of omega
sub k 0, all four terms

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.800
have the same characteristic.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.880
They're just a constant
times a power of x.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.380
So this is, then, the rewriting
of the Friedman equation one

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.080
more time, just using this
new definition of how we're

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.930
going to treat the
curvature of the universe.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.780
And simply by looking
at this formula

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.110
and applying it
to x equals 1, you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.270
can see that that
becomes then 1 is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.060
equal to the sum
of these omegas.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.110
And that can be thought
of as a clearer, perhaps,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.600
definition of what
omega sub k 0 is.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.030
It's just 1 minus all of the
other contributions to omega.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.974
So it's how much the actual
mass density of the universe

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:11.390
differs from the
critical density.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.762
Then once we have
this equation, which

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.220
is the equation
which tells us what

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.630
x dot is as a function of x,
we could just rewrite that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.940
by bringing dt to one
side of the equation

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.270
and dx to the other and
integrating both sides.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.460
And that leads to
our final result.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.890
The age of the universe is
simply given by that integral.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.880
And this is a very
neat expression

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.690
for the age of the
universe in terms

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.930
of the present value of
the Hubble expansion rate

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.790
and each contribution to omega
in terms of its present value.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.794
And you just plug those
into this formula.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.960
In general, you have to do
the integral numerically,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960
because the integral's
a little too complicated

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.550
to have an analytic expression.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.740
And that will give you
the age of universe

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.180
for any model that
meets this description.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.730
So any questions about that
calculation before we go on?

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.430
OK, very good.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.750
The next calculation
we did last time

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.800
was the calculation of
radiation flux versus redshift.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.960
And this is exactly
what the astronomers

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.270
were measuring in 1998
when they concluded

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.340
that the universe
was accelerating.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.230
They were looking at distant
supernova type 1a explosions.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.100
They made the assumption
that all supernova type

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.110
1a explosions have the same
intrinsic power output.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.704
That's based roughly on
observation and guesswork.

00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:47.370
There's not really a
good theory for it,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.510
so it's mostly a matter of being
consistent with observations.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.730
But then they could
calculate for any given model

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.450
in terms of these different
omegas what you expect in terms

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.190
of received radiation as
a function of redshift.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.060
And they compared their
data with the models--

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.010
and I'll show you
that data shortly--

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.890
and found that the
models only fit

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.740
if one had a significant
component of vacuum

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.630
energy causing
universe to accelerate.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.420
So to do the calculation, we
need a metric for the universe.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.336
And I considered only
the closed universe case.

00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:28.210
There's also the flat
case and the open case,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.470
which are similar.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.560
And you'll actually be asked to
do those on the homework set.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.390
So the metric for
a closed universe

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.320
can be written this
way, where sine psi is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.932
the square root of k
times r, to relate it

00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:47.140
to the other way-- the more
standard way-- of writing

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.750
the Robertson Walker metric.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.695
But for our purposes
for this calculation,

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:53.570
it's easiest to do it
this way, because we're

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.150
going to be interested in
radio trajectories of photons.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.330
And this metric simplifies
the radial direction

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.360
as much as it can be.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.770
It's just d psi squared.

00:06:40.645 --> 00:06:42.020
Oh, it's the
computer that froze.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.126
You never know with Windows.

00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:58.400
I think we're in business now.

00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:01.740
Back to where we were.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.440
We have the metric.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.960
Now what we want to do
is imagine a light source

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.340
being received by a detector.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.120
And we put the light
source in the center

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.161
of our coordinate system.

00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:14.020
We put the detector at some
distance corresponding to psi

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.900
equals psi sub D, where psi is
our radial coordinate and psi

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.594
sub D is the radial
coordinate of the detector.

00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:23.510
We imagine a whole sphere
with the same radius

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.180
as the detector,
because we expect

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.980
the source to be
spherically symmetric.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.530
And therefore, the light
emitted by the source

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.390
will be uniformly
spread over that sphere.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.020
And that will allow us to
calculate how much of it

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.840
will hit the detector.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.386
The fraction
hitting the detector

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.260
will just be the area
of the detector divided

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.010
by the area of the sphere.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.030
The area of the detector
is whatever it is.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.880
We call it capital A.
The area of the sphere

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.460
is 4 pi times the
radius of the sphere.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.740
And the radius of the sphere
in physical coordinates

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.310
is the scale factor squared
times the sine squared

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.070
of psi sub D, coming
from the metric.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.300
It's the radius that appears
in the angular part that

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.820
counts, because it's the angles
that we're integrating over

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.670
to get the area of the sphere.

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.940
So the radius is
just a tilde squared

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.360
times sine squared is
the radius squared.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.430
Then we also need to
remember something

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.680
we've said a number of times
previously in this class, which

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.430
is that when the photons
travel from the source

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.070
to the detector, their
intensity is suppressed

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:32.070
by two powers of 1 plus z,
two powers of the redshift.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.419
And one of those
factors in 1 plus z

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.059
comes from redshifting
each photon.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.850
The frequency of each
photon is redshifted,

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.340
and that means that the energy
of each photon is redshifted--

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.860
goes down by a
factor of 1 plus z.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.200
But in addition, the rate
of arrival of the photons

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.140
is essentially a clock
which is also time dilated.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.750
So the rate of arrival of the
photons as seen by the observer

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.460
is suppressed by another
factor of 1 plus z.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:05.480
So putting all that together,
the received energy flux,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.820
which is the power received
divided by the area,

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.120
is just the power emitted by
the source divided by 4 pi.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.990
We get this factor
of 1 plus z squared,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.120
due to what we just discussed.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.270
And then the a squared of
t sine squared psi sub D.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.290
So it's just the total
power times that fraction

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.160
that we receive times the two
factors of 1 over 1 plus z.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.560
And this then is essentially
the final answer,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.190
except we want to know how to
evaluate a tilde squared of t 0

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.850
and sine squared of psi
sub D in terms of things

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.030
that we more directly measure.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.969
So to do that, a
tilde of t 0 turns out

00:09:46.969 --> 00:09:48.510
to be easy, because
it really is just

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.140
related by the definition of
omega sub k 0 to omega sub k 0.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.940
So this formula is
just a rewriting

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.440
of the definition
of omega sub k 0.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.200
To figure out what
psi is, we want

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.870
to integrate along
the line of sight

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.510
to be able to figure
out the time of emission

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.880
in terms of psi.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.380
And that time of
emission could then

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.200
be related to the redshift,
because the redshift is just

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.980
the ratio of the scale factors
between reception and emission.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.890
So we look first at the metric.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.540
And say we're
going to be looking

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.430
at null geodesics in
the radial direction.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.310
And null means ds
squared equals 0,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.230
and that's minus c
squared dt squared

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.170
plus a tilde squared of
t times d psi squared.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.520
And that implies
immediately that the psi dt

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.450
is just equal to the speed
of light divided by a tilde.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.140
And then we can get
the total increment

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.030
in psi between the source
and us by integrating

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.150
between the time of
emission-- the time

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.420
of the source-- to the
present time-- t sub 0.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.340
And then it's just a matter
of changing variables

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.790
to express the variable
of integration.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:10.140
Instead of st, we could express
it as z-- the redshift itself.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.230
And that brings in a factor of
h, because h is a dot over a.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.119
And I showed the
manipulations last time,

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:18.410
but it brings in a factor of h.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.010
But we know what h is
as a function of z.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.680
It comes from the
Friedman equation.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.150
And that then gives us an
expression for psi of z sub

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.290
s as an integral over z.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.610
And writing in what h of
z is and what a tilde of z

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:40.180
is from that expression,
the expression for psi of z

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.290
becomes the equation
that's boxed.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.820
Just a matter of algebraic
substitutions involving

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.970
the Friedman equation, which
determines what h of z is.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.780
And then putting
everything together,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.560
J is just given by this
expression, where all I've done

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.610
is to substitute the
expression for a tilde of c 0.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.540
And sine squared
psi is still here,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.560
but it gets evaluated
according to that formula.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.100
And putting these together,
we have a complete calculation

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.790
of the received radiation
flux as a function

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:23.240
of cosmological parameters--
the omegas and the h 0--

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:28.180
and the redshift of the source.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.030
And that's the end
of the calculation.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.420
And that's where we
finished last time.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.195
So any questions about
that calculation?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.770
OK, fine.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.650
In that case, moving on, the
next thing I wanted to show you

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.920
was some real data.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.830
So here are some real data
from one of those two teams

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.890
that made the original
announcements in 1998.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.470
This is from the High-Z
Supernova Search Team.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.665
And I should write some
definitions on the blackboard.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.484
The vertical axis there
is essentially brightness.

00:13:19.484 --> 00:13:21.650
But you wouldn't expect the
astronomers to just call

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.230
it brightness, because they
like to use fancier words.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.680
So they write it as
little m minus capital

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.130
M-- measured in magnitudes,
they put in parentheses.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.960
And little m minus
capital M has the name,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:43.770
it's called the
distance modulus,

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.777
meaning it's a way of
measuring distance.

00:13:45.777 --> 00:13:48.110
They think of brightness as
a way of measuring distance,

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.400
which indeed is what
it's being used for.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:14:00.820
And it's defined as
5 times the logarithm

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:10.530
base 10 of d sub L
over 1 megaparsec,

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.551
which means the luminosity
distance-- I'll define this

00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:16.050
in more detail in
a second-- d sub L

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.010
is the luminosity distance--
distance as inferred

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.310
from the luminosity.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.250
And they're measuring
it in megaparsecs

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.820
and taking the
logarithm base 10.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.110
And then, by convention,
there's an offset here of 25.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.630
Why not?

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.530
So this is the definition
of the distance modulus.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:39.480
And d sub L is defined by
the relationship of what

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.350
J would be in a flat
Euclidean universe

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.630
if you were receiving
that luminosity.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.460
So J is equal to
the actual power

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:55.650
output of the source divided
by 4 pi d sub L squared.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.760
This defines d sub L. So
d sub L is the distance

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.420
that that source would have
to be at in a static Euclidean

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.320
universe for you to see
it with the brightness

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.430
that you actually see.

00:15:12.972 --> 00:15:14.680
This, I guess, completes
the definitions,

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.929
but we can put these together.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:30.940
And m minus M is then
equal to minus 5/2

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:44.270
times the logarithm
base 10 of 4 pi J times

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:51.980
1 megaparsec squared,
divided by the actual power

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:59.595
output of the source, and
then, of course, plus 25.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.433
So this relates this
distance modulus

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:10.100
to the energy flux and the power
output of the original source.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:29.220
There's also on this
slide the acronym MLCS.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.790
MLCS stand for multi-color
light curve shape.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:38.460
And what that refers to is the
High-Z Supernova Search Team

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.170
invented a method of
compensating, to some extent,

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.920
for small variations
in the actual power

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.285
output of the
supernovae type 1a.

00:16:47.285 --> 00:16:48.660
Instead of assuming
that they all

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.670
have exactly the
same brightness,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:54.270
they discovered by looking at
nearby supernovae of this type

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.480
that there's a correlation
between the absolute brightness

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.090
of the supernovae and the
shape of the light curve--

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.582
that is, light versus time.

00:17:05.582 --> 00:17:07.790
So they were careful to
measure the light versus time

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.849
for the supernovae that
they used in this study.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:13.400
And they used that as a way
of applying a small correction

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.040
to what they interpreted
as the intrinsic brightness

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.869
of each supernova.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:22.599
And the results
are these points.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.450
[INAUDIBLE] the top
are the raw points,

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.280
and three different curves
for three different models.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.410
And they characterize the
models in the same way

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.480
we would-- in terms of different
contributions to omega.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:40.680
So the top model is the
cosmological constant dominated

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.690
model, where omega
sub lambda, which

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.450
is what we've been calling
omega sub vac is 0.76.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.620
And it's a flat model,
so 0.24 for omega matter.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.340
And radiation is ignorable.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.580
They compared that with the
middle model of these three,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:08.250
which was a model that
had no vacuum energy,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.720
and omega matter of 0.2.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.060
That was essentially
the dominant model

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.890
at the time, the belief that
the universe was open then

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:21.060
had about a critical
density of 1/5 or 1/4.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:22.980
And then they also
compared it with a model

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.480
where omega was 1-- entirely of
matter with no vacuum energy.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.730
And that was this
dashed curve, which

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.380
is the lower of
these three curves.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.050
And when the data
is just plotted,

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.710
it's a little hard to see
how much difference there

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.180
is between the three curves.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.940
So they re-plotted the data,
plotting the middle curve

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.150
as a straight line
by construction.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.420
And then they plotted
deviations from that line.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.280
And they did that for both
the theoretical curves

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.530
and the data.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.220
And in this magnified
picture, you

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.410
can see a little bit better
that this top curve fits

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.760
things the best.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.570
And that's what they call
the lambda CDM model.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.090
It corresponds to
omega m equals 0.24.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.740
Omega lambda equals 0.76.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.000
So it's the model with
a cosmological constant,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.120
with a vacuum energy.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.760
And lambda CDM stands for
lambda and cold, dark matter.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.349
And cold, dark
matter is just what

00:19:19.349 --> 00:19:21.140
we've been calling
non-relativistic matter.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.470
So the claim is that these data
points, even though there's

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.430
a fair amount of scatter,
fit the top curve much,

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.290
much better than they
fit the middle curve

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.650
or the bottom curve.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.600
And statistically, that's true.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.300
It really is a much better
fit, even though by eye, it's

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.290
not that clear what's going on.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.020
I think by eye it looks clear
that the top one fits it better

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.310
than others, but
it's not that clear

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.914
how important the difference is.

00:19:49.914 --> 00:19:52.330
But nonetheless, the astronomers
were thoroughly convinced

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.650
that this was a real effect.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.960
There was considerable
discussion

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.660
about possible
systematic errors.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.310
And I guess next, I'll say
a few words about that.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.720
First of all, I
should maybe just

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.690
clarify a little bit
better what's being seen.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:16.600
What's being seen is that for
a given redshift, this curve,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.270
which basically shows brightness
in a funny, funny way, where

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:26.780
dimmer is upward, larger
values of little m minus M--

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.220
there's a minus sign
in this formula--

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.095
means a dimmer galaxy, one
that looks further away.

00:20:32.095 --> 00:20:36.660
And basically, when astronomers
see this, they think distance.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.670
So larger values
means further away.

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.920
So what's being seen is that
these distant supernovae

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.560
are a little bit
dimmer than what

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.029
you would expect in either
of the other two models,

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:51.195
either of the models that
do not have vacuum energy.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.050
And the amount by
which they're dimmer

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.580
is a few tenths of a magnitude.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.030
And each tenth of a magnitude
corresponds to about 10%

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.180
in brightness.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.530
So what they're saying is that
these distant if supernovae,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.000
if we assume they
really fit this curve,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.750
are 20% to 30%
dimmer than you would

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.340
have expected in other models.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.590
It might be worth saying a
little bit about why dimmer

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.354
is the right sign to correspond
to acceleration, which

00:21:22.354 --> 00:21:24.270
is by no means totally
obvious, I don't think.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.075
So we're plotting--

00:21:45.646 --> 00:21:47.120
AUDIENCE: What year is this?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.330
PROFESSOR: What year?

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:55.540
This was old data that
was published in 1998.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.470
It has gotten better.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.020
Now it's much more
unambiguous that this works.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.295
So this is distance as
inferred by brightness.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.160
So this is basically
what's being plotted.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.920
If one thinks about a
fixed z in which way

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.390
that you go-- up or down--
I find that totally cryptic.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.130
I don't really parse that
very well in my own head.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.590
But it's much clearer if you
think about the other way.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.330
You could think about a
galaxy-- or a supernova

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.006
in this case-- at a
fixed distance, and ask,

00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:42.380
suppose I compare different
models-- ones that accelerate

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.660
and models that
don't accelerate.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:48.070
So if we fix the distance
and say, what would we

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.710
expect for the
redshift of a given

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.690
galaxy, in an accelerating
model versus a non-accelerating

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.289
model-- remember, the
redshift is basically

00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:59.080
a measure of the
velocity, or at least it's

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.520
strongly influenced by the
velocity of the object.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.380
So if the universe
is accelerating,

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.870
it means that the universe was
expanding slower in the past

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.550
than you would have
thought otherwise.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:14.350
It's speeded up to reach
its present expansion rate.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.420
So an accelerating
universe is a universe

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.710
that was expanding
slower in the past.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.360
And slower in the past means
that a galaxy at a given

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.330
distance would have
been moving slower,

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.090
and hence would have
had a lower value of z.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:31.320
So the effect of acceleration
for a given distance-- we'll

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.830
fix the distance-- should be
to move the line that way,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:36.835
towards lower z.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.960
And by moving the dot that way,
it puts it above the curve.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.730
So it's the same as
shifting things up,

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:59.420
which is the more
natural way of describing

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.620
what's seen in the graph.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.494
The points are higher
than the curve.

00:24:07.709 --> 00:24:10.000
So the bottom line, though,
is that what they're saying

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.160
is distant supernovae are
20%, 30% dimmer than you

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.130
might have thought.

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.379
And from that, they want to
infer that the universe is

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:21.634
accelerating, which is a
rather dramatic conclusion.

00:24:21.634 --> 00:24:23.300
So naturally, you
want to ask, are there

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.279
other things that can cause
supernovae to look dimmer?

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:27.820
And of course, there
are other things

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.486
that can cause
supernovae to look dimmer

00:24:29.486 --> 00:24:31.220
than you might have thought.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.620
And there are two
main ideas that

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.840
were discussed at the time.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.594
One of them is just plain dust.

00:25:00.594 --> 00:25:03.010
If you're looking at something
through a dusty atmosphere,

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.740
it looks dimmer than
it would otherwise.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.280
And that is a
genuine possibility

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.250
that was strongly considered.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:25.470
The arguments against
dust were mainly twofold.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.860
The first is that
dust very rarely

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.450
absorbs uniformly
across the spectrum.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.390
Dust usually-- depending on
the size of the dust grains--

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:41.210
absorbs more blue
light than red light,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:43.320
leaving more red
light coming through.

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.460
So the effect of seeing
something through dust

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.690
is normally to cause
it to look more red.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.710
And this reddening was not seen.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.445
The spectrum of the light
from the existing supernovae

00:26:17.445 --> 00:26:19.150
was analyzed very carefully.

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.790
And the spectrum
of the distant ones

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:23.850
looked just like the spectrum of
the nearby ones-- appropriately

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.160
redshifted, of course, but
otherwise not distorted

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:27.790
in any way.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.270
There was no sign
of this reddening.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.970
Now, it's possible to have
what the astronomers refer

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:37.200
to as gray dust, which is by
definition dust that absorbs

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.780
uniformly across the spectrum
of what you're looking at.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.080
But the grains have
to be unusually large.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.200
And nobody was ever
able to figure out

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.520
a source for dust
grains of that sort.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.040
So based partly on
theoretical grounds

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.790
and partly on what
nobody has ever found,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.000
there's no evidence
for dust grains

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.510
that would possibly
cause dimming

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.715
that would look this way,
that would be dimming

00:26:59.715 --> 00:27:01.791
that was uniform
across the spectrum.

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:02.290
Yes?

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.956
AUDIENCE: How do you
tell the difference

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:07.406
between reddened light from
dust and redshifted light?

00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:09.280
PROFESSOR: OK, how do
you tell the difference

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.549
between reddened light from
dust and plain old redshift?

00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:15.840
The difference is that the
plain old redshift uniformly

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.820
shifts everything
by the same factor.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.420
So the whole spectrum is
just moved down uniformly

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.670
towards the red.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.090
This reddening
effect really means

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:24.506
that the blue part
of the spectrum

00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:26.310
is depressed relative
to the red part.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.976
So the shape of the
spectrum is changed.

00:27:36.202 --> 00:27:38.160
So one argument is that
we don't see reddening,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:43.640
and we don't know any way to
make dust that would be gray.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.280
The second argument is that
if dust was a major factor,

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.390
presumably most of the
dust that would be relevant

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.080
would be dust in the same galaxy
as the supernova explosion

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.075
itself, because there's
not that much dust

00:27:55.075 --> 00:27:58.250
in intergalactic space.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:04.350
And if dust in the galaxy of the
supernova itself were relevant,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:11.150
then-- let me draw a
little picture here.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.950
So if dust in what's
called the host

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:38.730
galaxy-- the galaxy which
has the supernova in it--

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.850
then you would have
a picture where

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:47.620
there would be a ball of
dust filling the galaxy.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:54.090
And the supernova that you're
looking at might be there,

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.300
or it might be there.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.790
And let's say we're
looking from over here.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:02.380
So depending on where the
supernova was in the galaxy,

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.740
we would see very different
amounts of intervening dust.

00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.040
And if dust were
causing this dimming,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.290
it would mean we would be
seeing a significant scatter

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:14.330
in the amount of dimming
depending on where

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.670
the supernova happened
to be in its host galaxy.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.350
And that spread was not seen.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.070
The spread that one
sees in that curve

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:28.050
could be measured and calibrated
against known uncertainties

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.205
in the brightness of
supernovae and then

00:29:30.205 --> 00:29:31.820
the detection apparatus.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.570
And the spread that
was seen was just what

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.730
you expect without any
additional spread associated

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.730
with a dusty galaxy
acting as the host.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:30:15.760
So no evidence for the
spread of brightnesses

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.880
that would be expected
from a dusty host.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.400
Another item that
was considered--

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.280
these are the main
arguments against dust--

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.300
another argument
that was considered,

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.930
another possible source of
dimming, is galactic evolution.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.090
And there, the main effect
that people worried about

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.570
was the production of
heavy chemical elements

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.810
during the life of a galaxy.

00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.339
As you've certainly learned
about from your reading--

00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:15.630
I don't know if we've talked
about it in class or not--

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.130
the early universe was essential
all hydrogen and helium.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.170
Heavier elements were
made later in stars

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.610
that produce
supernovae explosions.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.730
And these supernovae
explosions gradually

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:32.450
cause galaxies to become
more and more enriched

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.050
with heavy elements.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.830
And by heavy, I mean
anything heavier than helium.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:40.950
And that could
affect, in principle,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.570
the behavior of
supernovae explosions.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.600
So the evidence
against that was simply

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.210
that every other
characteristic that astronomers

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.120
could measure of
these supernovae

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.150
in the distant
galaxies looked exactly

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.020
like what was seen
for nearby galaxies.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.635
So no evidence for any
kind of evolution was seen.

00:32:05.635 --> 00:32:07.010
And there are many
properties you

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.670
could measure that are
independent of distance,

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.050
like the shape of the
spectrum and things like that,

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.160
and the pattern of the
light curve versus time.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.250
So all those characteristics
that astronomers can measure

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.030
seem to be exactly the same
for the very distant supernovae

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:24.260
which happened
billions of years ago,

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:28.530
and the more nearby ones
that happened recently.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.000
And furthermore,
among the nearby ones,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.722
there's a big spread of
abundances of heavy chemical

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.430
elements, just because
different galaxies

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.300
have had different histories.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.160
So among the nearby
ones, you could

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.290
look for is there
an effect caused

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.880
by the relative abundance
of heavy elements,

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.600
and astronomers didn't find any.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.270
So there was no sign
that galactic evolution

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:57.334
could be playing a role
here, even though one

00:32:57.334 --> 00:32:58.500
does need to worry about it.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:13.120
So the point is that
distant supernovae 1a

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.380
look like nearby ones.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.130
I'll call that a in my outline.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:58.830
And b is that among the nearby
1a's, heavy element abundance

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.195
had no perceptible effect.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.639
So the dominant opinion
gradually shifted,

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.889
and now I think it's almost 100%
that this acceleration is real.

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:22.250
The acceleration, by
the way, is further

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.110
confirmed by measurements
of fluctuations

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.300
in the cosmic background
radiation measurements that

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.300
have been done by some
ground-based experiments,

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.920
and also the satellite
experiments of WMAP

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:37.510
and now Planck, which
measure the anisotropies--

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.822
the ripples-- in the cosmic
background radiation.

00:34:40.822 --> 00:34:42.530
It's hard to see what
those ripples would

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.372
have to do with the
amount of vacuum energy.

00:34:46.372 --> 00:34:48.580
But it does turn out-- and
we'll talk more about this

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.010
a little bit later--
that we really

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.260
do have a detailed theory
of what makes these ripples.

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:55.560
We can calculate what the
spectrum of those ripples

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.889
should look like.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.960
And the calculations
depend on parameters

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.790
which include the
amount of vacuum energy.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.890
And in order to
make things work,

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.520
one does have to put
in essentially exactly

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.390
the same amount of vacuum
energy as has been detected

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.200
in these supernova
1a observations.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.810
So everything fits
together very tightly.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:19.750
And I think now, just about
everybody is convinced

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.630
that the universe
really is accelerating.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.450
The acceleration
could, in principle,

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:28.010
have at least two different
causes that we can talk about.

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.590
One is vacuum energy, which is
the one that I'm focusing on,

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.940
which is the
simplest explanation.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.680
The other possibility that is
discussed in the literature

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.950
is something called
quintessence,

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:40.740
which is a made-up word.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.830
And what it refers
to is the possibility

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:46.310
that the acceleration
of the universe today

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.950
could be caused by a mechanism
which is really in principle

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.640
exactly the same as what
we talk about for inflation

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.450
in the early universe and
will be talking about later.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:59.540
Specifically, there could be
a slowly evolving scalar field

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.080
which is essentially uniform
throughout the universe,

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.525
and changing slowly with time so
it looks like it's a constant.

00:36:06.525 --> 00:36:09.040
And it could be the energy
density of that scalar field

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.840
that is looking to us as
if it were vacuum energy.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.050
But that's the
minority point of view.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.140
And that introduces
extra parameters

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:24.154
that don't seem to be necessary.

00:36:24.154 --> 00:36:25.070
But it's up for grabs.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:25.903
Nobody really knows.

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.090
OK, any questions about
what we just talked about?

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.970
In that case, let me go
on to my next topic, which

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.500
is I want to talk
a little bit more

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:44.000
about the physics
of vacuum energy.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.810
What is it that we
understand about it,

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.830
and why is it that
most physicists say

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:52.520
it's the least understood
issue in physics?

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.380
We really don't
understand vacuum energy,

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.470
even though we do understand
why it might be nonzero.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:01.980
Where we're totally at a loss
is trying to make any sense out

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:06.040
of the value of the energy
density that is actually

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.140
observed.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:14.590
So where does vacuum energy come
from in a quantum field theory?

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.390
There are basically, I would
say, three contributions.

00:37:50.799 --> 00:37:52.590
Maybe I should say in
quantum field theory.

00:38:05.757 --> 00:38:07.840
The other context in which
this might be discussed

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.885
would be string theory.

00:38:10.885 --> 00:38:13.010
I may or may not say
something about string theory,

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:14.960
but I won't say much.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.090
But in quantum field
theory, there are basically,

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:18.960
I think, three contributions.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.230
The first is the
easiest to understand,

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:40.100
which is quantum fluctuations
in bosonic fields,

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.050
where the best
example is the photon,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.530
or the electromagnetic field.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.934
Now, in a classical
vacuum, e and b-- the

00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:54.350
the electric and
magnetic fields--

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.766
would just be 0, because that's
the lowest possible energy

00:38:56.766 --> 00:38:58.510
density.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:03.032
But just as you are
probably aware that

00:39:03.032 --> 00:39:05.490
there's an uncertainty principle
in quantum mechanics which

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.840
tells you that the momentum and
position of a particle cannot

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.630
be well-defined
at the same time,

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.970
it is also true that e and
b cannot be well-defined

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.190
at the same time.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.850
So the uncertainty principles
applied to the field theory

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:24.370
imply that e and b cannot
just be 0 and stay 0.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:28.150
E and b are constantly
fluctuating.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.480
And that means
that there's energy

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.540
associated with
those fluctuations.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.560
And the mathematics of it is
actually incredibly simple.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.030
If one imagines the
fields inside a box,

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:45.210
to be able to at least
avoid the infinity of space,

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.130
the fields inside a
box could be described

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.510
in terms of standing waves,
where each standing wave is

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:54.470
either a half wavelength or
a full wavelength across.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:58.830
And by the way, you'll be doing
a homework problem on this.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.070
And each standing
wave has the physics

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.260
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.800
It oscillates sinusoidally
with time, the wave.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.660
And when one works out
the mathematics, and even

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.570
the quantum mechanics,
it's exactly the same

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.610
as a harmonic oscillator.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:18.320
So each standing wave
has a zero-point energy.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.490
You may know that the zero-point
energy of a harmonic oscillator

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:26.170
is not 0, but it's 1/2 h
bar omega, or 1/2 h nu,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:29.040
depending on whether you're
using nu or omega to describe

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.250
the frequency of the oscillator.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.660
So each standing wave
contributes 1/2 h bar omega.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:03.830
And then the problem is how
many standing waves are there?

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.270
And the answer is, there's
an infinite number of them,

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.810
because there's no limit to how
short the wavelength can be.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.590
So there's no limit to
how many ups and downs you

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.980
can have in your
standing wave from one

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.299
end of the box to the next.

00:41:18.299 --> 00:41:19.715
So the answer you
get is infinite.

00:41:19.715 --> 00:41:20.410
It diverges.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:45.610
Now, the fact that it
diverges at short distances

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.294
can be used as an excuse for
getting the problem wrong.

00:41:49.294 --> 00:41:50.210
Obviously, it's wrong.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.190
The answer's not infinite.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:55.291
But we have an excuse,
because we certainly

00:41:55.291 --> 00:41:57.290
know there are wavelengths
that are short enough

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.748
that we don't understand the
physics at those length scales

00:41:59.748 --> 00:42:00.760
anymore.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.270
We're basing everything on
extrapolating from wavelengths

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.450
that we can actually
measure in the laboratory.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.445
So one could
imagine that there's

00:42:08.445 --> 00:42:10.820
some wavelength beyond which
everything we're saying here

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.236
is nonsense, and we don't have
to keep adding up 1/2 h bar

00:42:13.236 --> 00:42:15.050
omega anymore,
because the arguments

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.940
that justify the 1/2 h
bar omega no longer apply.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:22.500
So we can use that as a
cutoff for the calculation.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.990
And a typical
cutoff-- by typical, I

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:28.820
mean typical in arguments
that physicists talk about, so

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.670
typical in physics speak.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.440
So a cutoff that's
often invoked here

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:53.960
is the Planck scale,
which is the square root

00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.280
of h bar times G
divided by c cubed.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:05.180
And that has units
of length, and it's

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:13.412
equal to about 1.6 times 10
to the minus 33 centimeters.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:19.270
And what makes the
scale significant

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.370
is it's the scale at which we
expect the effects of quantum

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:24.992
gravity to start
to be important.

00:43:24.992 --> 00:43:26.450
And we know that
this quantum field

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.720
theory that we're
talking about does not

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.230
include the effects of gravity.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:30.604
And we don't really
even know how

00:43:30.604 --> 00:43:33.735
to modify it so that it would
include the effects of gravity.

00:43:33.735 --> 00:43:35.110
So the quantum
effects of gravity

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.580
are still something
of a mystery.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.750
So it makes sense to
cut the theory off,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.870
if not earlier, at least
at the Planck scale.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:44.749
Yes?

00:43:44.749 --> 00:43:47.040
AUDIENCE: So I would imagine
what we're doing, in order

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.498
to say that we have a standing
wave, we have to have a box.

00:43:49.498 --> 00:43:52.952
And then in order to realize
the fact that the universe may

00:43:52.952 --> 00:43:56.680
be large, you just take the
limit as the box gets large.

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.350
But is it really OK to do that?

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.402
I mean, to treat
an infinite system

00:44:01.402 --> 00:44:05.700
as the limit of a finite system?

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.305
PROFESSOR: OK, the
question is-- what

00:44:08.305 --> 00:44:09.680
we're going to be
doing here is I

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.610
talked about putting the
standing waves in a box.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.110
And then at the end, we're
going to take the limit

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.530
as the box gets
bigger and bigger.

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.810
And the question is, is
that really a valid way

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:20.920
of treating the infinite space?

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.170
And the answer is,
in this case, it is.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:30.497
I'm not sure how solid
an argument I can make.

00:44:30.497 --> 00:44:32.580
Certainly what one does
find is what you'd expect,

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.460
that as you make the
box bigger and bigger,

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.610
the energy that you get is
proportional to the size

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:37.630
of the box.

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.830
So you're calculating
an energy density.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:48.690
And probably the most precise
thing I can say at the moment

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.160
is that if it were not true,
if the answer you got really

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.070
depended on the way in which
the space was infinite,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.610
then you'd be learning something
about the infinite universe

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.990
by doing an experiment
in the lab, which

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.980
is a little far-fetched.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:05.760
That is, if you do an
experiment in a lab,

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.780
it really doesn't
tell you anything

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.946
about whether the universe
is infinite or turns back

00:45:08.946 --> 00:45:10.940
on itself and is closed.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:12.679
And calculations
certainly do show

00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:14.220
that you get the
same-- you could do,

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.820
for example, a closed
universe without a box.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:18.470
And you get the
same energy density,

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.420
as long as the universe was
big, as we're getting this way.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:26.630
So I think there's a pretty
solid calculational evidence

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.940
that what you get does
not depend on the box.

00:45:32.164 --> 00:45:33.193
Yes?

00:45:33.193 --> 00:45:34.609
AUDIENCE: Going
off that question,

00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:37.054
do we use the maximum
size of our box

00:45:37.054 --> 00:45:40.390
as the size of our
observable universe, then?

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.140
PROFESSOR: OK, the
question is, what do we

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.795
use as the maximum
size of the box?

00:45:43.795 --> 00:45:46.045
Is it the size of the
observable universe?

00:45:46.045 --> 00:45:47.670
The answer really is
that what you find

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.836
is that you get an energy
density that's independent

00:45:49.836 --> 00:45:52.620
of the size of the box,
as long as the box is big.

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:55.680
And it's that energy density
that we're looking for.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:58.240
We don't claim to know anything
about the total energy.

00:46:01.102 --> 00:46:02.810
And we don't really
need to know anything

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:03.680
about the total energy.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.720
Everything that we formulated
here in terms of energy

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.219
densities.

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:17.645
Now, the catch is, that
if one puts in this cutoff

00:46:17.645 --> 00:46:20.920
and takes into account only
the energies of 1/2 h bar

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.160
omega going up to this cutoff
and stopping there-- or down

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.392
to the cutoff if one's thinking
of length as the measure--

00:46:29.392 --> 00:46:31.350
you could then ask, do
we get an energy density

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.710
that's in any way close to
what the astronomers tell us

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:37.350
the vacuum energy actually is?

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:41.130
And the answer is
emphatically no.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:42.570
We don't get anything close.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:44.990
We're in fact off by about
120 orders of magnitude,

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:49.620
which even in cosmology is
a significant embarrassment,

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:54.090
which is why physicists consider
this question of the vacuum

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.460
energy density to be such
an incredible mystery.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.200
We really have no
idea how to get

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.875
a number as small
as what we observe.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.107
Let us go on to talk
about other contributions,

00:47:07.107 --> 00:47:09.190
because they are certainly
important in the way we

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:10.005
think about things.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.130
So far I have number one, right?

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.220
So next comes two.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:48:02.150
And that is the quantum
fluctuations of Fermi fields,

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:05.431
where the best-known example
here is the electron.

00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:07.430
Now, in quantum field
theory, I should point out

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.855
that all particles are described
by fields, not just the photon.

00:48:10.855 --> 00:48:13.090
The electron is described
by a field also.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.180
It's called the electron field.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:19.830
And because the electron is
a fermion and not a boson,

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.130
the electron field has
somewhat different properties

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.410
than bosonic fields,
reflecting the fact

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:29.490
that the fermions themselves
obey the exclusion principle.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.160
It turns out that
for fermions, there

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.170
are also quantum fluctuations.

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:35.791
They're also of order
1/2 h bar omega.

00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:37.540
But actually, it's a
little bit different.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.130
They're in some sense h
bar omega and not 1/2.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:43.810
But what's peculiar is that
for electrons, the contribution

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:44.435
is negative.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:03.250
And the origin of this
negativity I think

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.170
has a fairly simple
explanations,

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:09.710
although the explanation is
not ever given, actually.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.240
The exploration that's used
in quantum field theory books

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.659
involves looking at
equation 47 and seeing

00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:17.200
that there's an
anticommutator there.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.510
And because the
fields anticommute,

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:19.384
there's a minus sign.

00:49:19.384 --> 00:49:21.440
And that means the
energy is negative.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.640
And that is basically the way
it's described in textbooks.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.080
That certainly says
where the minus sign

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.280
appears in which equation.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.446
But I don't think it's
really an explanation of what

00:49:31.446 --> 00:49:33.120
the minus sign is talking about.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.328
But I think there is an
explanation of what the minus

00:49:35.328 --> 00:49:37.990
sign is talking about, which
goes back to the old picture

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.480
that Dirac himself
introduced when he first

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.780
invented the Dirac equation.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.180
When Dirac first invented
the Dirac equation,

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.940
he was trying to
interpret it more or less

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.360
in the same language as
the Schrodinger equation.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.240
We don't quite do that anymore.

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.340
But in doing that,
Dirac discovered

00:49:56.340 --> 00:49:58.760
that his Dirac
equation, which was

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.020
the natural relativistic
generalization

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.280
of the Schrodinger equation
to a particle which

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:10.004
has spin 1/2, which I'm not sure
how Dirac knew it had spin 1/2,

00:50:10.004 --> 00:50:11.420
but in any case,
it's the equation

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.690
for a particle of spin 1/2.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.940
And what he found was that if
you just look at the energy

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.720
the spectrum that the
equation itself gives you,

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.620
it's symmetric about 0.

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:26.560
So if we plot energy going this
way, if there's a state here,

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.299
there's also a state
there at negative energy.

00:50:29.299 --> 00:50:30.840
And if there's a
state there, there's

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.460
another state there,
exactly opposite it.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.620
It's completely
symmetric up and down.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.040
Now, the interpretation
that Dirac gave to that

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:44.030
was not that there are a lot of
ways of making negative energy.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.570
He realized that the
vacuum is by definition

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:49.500
the state of lowest
possible energy.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.950
And if you can lower the
energy by adding a particle

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.487
to these negative
energy states, that

00:50:55.487 --> 00:50:57.820
would mean that there'd be a
way of lowering the energy,

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.350
and the state would
not be the vacuum.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:04.860
So the vacuum, Dirac
proposed, is the state

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:08.105
in which all of these negative
energy levels are filled.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:23.570
And the action of putting
all these x's on the picture

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:25.980
is often called
filling the Dirac sea.

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:43.340
S-E-A-- sea, where sea refers
to this ocean of negative energy

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.710
states, which is infinite.

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.810
It just keeps going down.

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.140
You can imagine filling all of
them to describe the vacuum.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.140
Then if you ask what is
the physics after you've

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.930
done that-- what are
the possible excitations

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:56.721
of the vacuum, what
states does this theory

00:51:56.721 --> 00:51:58.240
contain other than the vacuum?

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.930
And the answer is that
there could be occupations

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:06.020
of these positive energy states,
and those are called electrons.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.652
It's also possible
to remove-- if you

00:52:08.652 --> 00:52:10.110
put in the right
amount of energy--

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:12.420
one of the negative energy
states, which is filled,

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.040
but we could take away
the particle that's there.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.144
And the absence of a
particle there-- a hole

00:52:18.144 --> 00:52:19.935
in the negative energy
sea-- is a positron.

00:52:30.247 --> 00:52:31.205
So electrons are there.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:42.250
The e plus is a hole
in the Dirac sea.

00:52:46.517 --> 00:52:48.100
Now, the difficulty
with this picture,

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.184
and the reason why it's
not often use these days,

00:52:51.184 --> 00:52:52.725
is that it makes it
look like there's

00:52:52.725 --> 00:52:56.450
an intrinsic difference between
electrons and positrons.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:58.080
Nonetheless, Dirac
was perfectly aware

00:52:58.080 --> 00:52:59.580
that when you went
through the math,

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.895
they were completely symmetric.

00:53:00.895 --> 00:53:02.520
The fact that you
described it this way

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.070
is just really a feature
of your description,

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.710
but it doesn't make any
measurable difference.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:11.220
So a positron really is just a
perfect image of an electron,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.340
but with the opposite
charge, with otherwise

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:15.656
all the same
physical properties.

00:53:15.656 --> 00:53:17.030
And there's ways
of describing it

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.570
where you don't make this
distinction between particles

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:20.550
and holes.

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:22.550
But the particle hole way
is I think the easiest

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.190
way of understanding where the
negative energy is coming from.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.820
The negative energy came by
saying that the energy was 0

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.190
before we filled
any of these levels.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.710
And as you fill the
negative energy sea,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.580
you're lowering
energy all the time.

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:37.460
And it's that contribution
which makes up

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:41.100
the infinite negative
contribution coming

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.190
from the Fermi fields.

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.230
And the algebra is
certainly exactly right.

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.100
The energy that
people write down

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.170
for the negative energy
of the Fermi fields--

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:53.870
what they get by anticommuting
two operators in equation 37--

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.550
is exactly the
expression you get

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:59.300
for what it takes to
fill the Dirac sea.

00:53:59.300 --> 00:53:59.800
Yes?

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.288
AUDIENCE: Are we
pretty confident

00:54:01.288 --> 00:54:03.215
that the smallness
of the vacuum energy

00:54:03.215 --> 00:54:05.256
can't come from cancellations
between the bosonic

00:54:05.256 --> 00:54:06.512
and the Fermi fields?

00:54:06.512 --> 00:54:08.720
PROFESSOR: OK, the question
is, are we confident that

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.450
the cancellation cannot come
from the cancellations between

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:13.810
the Fermi fields and
the bosonic fields.

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.850
No, we're all confident that
it cannot come from that.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.900
it very likely does
come from that.

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:22.110
But we are confident that we
have no idea why that happens.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:24.150
And therefore,
it's a big mystery.

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:26.090
Certainly our ignorance
allows for any answer.

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.131
Because we have a positive
infinite contribution,

00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:30.340
we're just going to cut
off and make it large.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:32.872
And we're going to have a
negative contribution, which

00:54:32.872 --> 00:54:35.080
we're going to cut off and
make it large in magnitude

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:35.540
but negative.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.520
And then we're
going to add them,

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.354
and we have no idea
what we're going to get.

00:54:38.354 --> 00:54:39.770
But the fact that
we get something

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:42.910
that gets incredibly close to
0, and not something that's

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.330
at all the same magnitude as the
pieces you're adding together--

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.520
the positive piece or
the negative piece--

00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.550
means there's something going
on that we don't understand.

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:53.800
There's a cancellation that's
happening that we cannot

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.170
explain.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.670
Now, I should maybe
add that there's

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.540
one context where we would
expect a cancellation.

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.210
And that is, there
are theories that

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.150
are what are called
supersymmetric,

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:06.740
which have a perfect symmetry
between bosons and fermions,

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:11.780
which would relate the
positive energy from the photon

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.280
to the infinite negative energy
you would get from particles

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.350
called photinos, which would
be the supersymmetric partner

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:20.280
of the photons-- a
spin 1/2 particle

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.210
that's a mirror
image of a photon

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.390
but has a fermionic character.

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:28.340
So in an exactly
supersymmetric theory,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.370
you would get an
exact cancellation

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:33.840
between the positive and
the negative contributions.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:37.570
And the answer has to be 0 in an
exactly supersymmetric theory.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:43.010
However, the world is clearly
not exactly supersymmetric.

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:46.522
This photino has
never been seen.

00:55:46.522 --> 00:55:48.730
And there'd be a particle
called the selectron, which

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:51.840
would be the scalar partner
of the electron, which

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.900
also has not been seen.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.240
And every known
particle would have

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:59.200
a partner, which
has not been seen.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.716
There are no supersymmetric
pairs which are known.

00:56:02.716 --> 00:56:04.340
So supersymmetry is
still a possibility

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.240
as a broken symmetry of nature.

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.000
And a lot of people think-- for
pretty good reasons, I thin--

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.030
that it's very likely
that the world does

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:14.710
have an underlying
supersymmetry.

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.530
But as long as the
supersymmetry is broken,

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.500
it no longer guarantees
this cancellation.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.890
And you could estimate
what the mismatch is.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:24.770
And it does make things
a little bit better here.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:27.300
If we just take this
Planck scale cutoff,

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:32.100
we miss an energy density by a
factor of about 10 to the 120.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.250
If we apply
supersymmetry and make

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.420
an estimate of what the
supersymmetry breaking scale is

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.920
and what effect that has on the
mismatch of these calculations,

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:41.870
then it gets reduced.

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:44.080
Instead of being 120 order
of magnitude problems,

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.490
it's got a 50 order of
magnitude problem, which

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:51.300
is a lot better,
but not good enough.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:55.330
Now, I do want to mention
a third contribution here

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.410
for completeness.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:59.180
The third one is
likely be finite,

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:04.812
so it's not as problematic
as the other two.

00:57:04.812 --> 00:57:06.884
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:06.884 --> 00:57:07.800
PROFESSOR: Same thing.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.440
Planck scale.

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.436
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:18.970
PROFESSOR: The
third contribution

00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:27.630
is that some fields
are believed to have

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.080
nonzero values in the vacuum.

00:57:39.223 --> 00:57:47.311
And the famous example of
that is the Higgs field,

00:57:47.311 --> 00:57:49.310
for which the particle
associated with the Higgs

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:54.370
was discovered a
year ago at CERN,

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.967
after over 50 years
of looking for it.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.597
And the Higgs field is
maybe the only field

00:58:01.597 --> 00:58:03.180
that's part of the
standard model that

00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:07.460
has a nonzero expectation value,
a nonzero value in the vacuum.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:08.894
But in more
sophisticated theories

00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:10.310
like grand unified
theories, there

00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:13.680
are many more fields that have
nonzero values in the vacuum.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.370
So that's a likely extension
of our standard model

00:58:17.370 --> 00:58:19.990
of particle physics.

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:25.980
So the bottom line is that it's
easy for particle physicists

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:30.430
to understand why the vacuum
energy should be nonzero,

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:35.900
but damned hard to have any
idea of why it has the value

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.420
that it has.

00:58:39.492 --> 00:58:41.200
We'll talk maybe at
the end of the course

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.960
about the possibility that
the value of the vacuum energy

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:49.100
density is, quote,
"anthropically selected."

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.971
That is one possible
explanation,

00:58:50.971 --> 00:58:52.720
which maybe shows how
desperate physicists

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.120
are to look for an
explanation here.

00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:58.230
One possible explanation
begins with ideas

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:00.920
from string theory, where
string theory tells us

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.000
that there isn't just
one kind of vacuum,

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.760
but in fact, a huge number
of different types of vacuum,

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.360
perhaps 10 to the 500.

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.310
And that would
mean that if there

00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:16.680
were sort of random values for
these infinite numbers that

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.239
get cut off, that get cut
off with different values--

00:59:19.239 --> 00:59:21.280
and there are other ways
of looking at the vacuum

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.820
energy in string
theories-- you'd

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:25.530
expect coming out
of string theory

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:28.670
that the typical vacuum energy
would be about the same as what

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.772
you get when you
cut off the quantum

00:59:30.772 --> 00:59:32.480
fluctuations of the
electromagnetic field

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.700
at the Planck scale.

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.680
That is, the typical
vacuum energy coming out

00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.160
of a string theory would be
at the Planck scale, which

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.679
is this huge number
compared to what we observe.

00:59:41.679 --> 00:59:43.095
But string theory
would be predict

00:59:43.095 --> 00:59:46.700
that there would be a spread
of numbers going essentially

00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:49.150
from plus the Planck scale
to minus the Planck scale,

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:52.150
with everything in between.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:54.800
There'd be a tiny fraction
of those vacua that

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.695
would have a very small vacuum
energy like what we observe.

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.570
That's what you'd expect
from string theory--

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.560
a large number, but a tiny
fraction of vacua that

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.760
would be in that integral.

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.690
And then the only
problem would be

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:13.010
to explain why we might likely
be living in such an unusually

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:17.290
small fraction of the set
of all possible vacuums.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.920
And the answer to
that that's discussed

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.330
is that it may be
anthropically selected.

01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:27.010
That is, life may only
form when the vacuum

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:29.650
energy is incredibly small.

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:32.560
And that is not built
entirely from whole cloth.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.220
There is some
physics behind that.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.440
We know that this vacuum energy
affects the Friedman equation,

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.800
which means it affects the
expansion rate of the universe.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.820
So if we had a Planck
scale vacuum energy,

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.330
that would cause the
universe to essentially blow

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:51.760
apart at the time scale of the
Planck scale, which is about 10

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.142
to the minus 40
something seconds,

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:57.100
due to the huge repulsion
that would be created

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:59.410
by that positive vacuum energy.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:03.360
And conversely, if there
was a huge negative vacuum

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.140
energy on the order
of the Planck scale,

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:08.420
the universe would just
implode on a time scale

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.830
of order of the
Planck scale-- 10

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:12.610
to the minus 40
something seconds.

01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:15.870
So assuming that life takes
billions of years to evolve

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:18.470
and assuming nothing
else about life,

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.070
one can conclude that
life can only exist

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:24.980
in the very narrow band
of possible vacuum energy

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.610
densities which are
incredibly small, like the one

01:01:27.610 --> 01:01:29.380
that we're living in.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.660
So it could be that we're
here only because there

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.990
isn't any life anyplace else.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.620
So all living things see a very,
very small value of this vacuum

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.110
energy density, even though
if you plunk yourself down

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.830
at a random place
in this multiverse,

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.810
you'd be likely to see
a vacuum energy that's

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:49.180
near the Planck scale.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.360
OK, I'm done talking
about this for now.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.020
Any further questions about
it before we leave the topic?

01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:07.435
I had suggested that we go
on to talk about problems

01:02:07.435 --> 01:02:09.650
with the conventional
big bang model,

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:13.210
but, there is actually
something else I wanted to do.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:15.130
I don't know how long
it will take exactly,

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.800
but I have a little historical
interlude to talk about here.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.140
We've been talking about
the Friedman equations

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.790
and how they're modified by the
cosmological constant, which

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:33.190
of course is an item that was
very dear to Einstein's heart.

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.260
So I'd like to tell
you a little history

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.530
story about Albert Einstein
and Alexander Friedman,

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.250
which I think is
very interesting.

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:44.310
The punchline of the story is
that Einstein made pretty much

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.080
of a fool out of
himself on this.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.020
And the reason why I like
the story is maybe twofold.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.490
One is, I find it
very comforting

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:55.750
to know that even perhaps the
greatest physicist of all time

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.890
can make dumb mistakes
just like the rest of us

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.760
make dumb mistakes.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.310
I think that's a very comforting
thing to keep in mind.

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:06.100
And the other moral
of the story is,

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.640
I think, the
importance of trying

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.150
to be open-minded about
issues in physics.

01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:15.220
Einstein was very much convinced
that the universe was static,

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.160
and so convinced that,
in fact, he really made

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.020
stupid mistakes trying to
defend his static universe.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:24.690
So this will be a story
of such a mistake.

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.720
So those are the two people.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:31.287
Friedman was a Russian natural--
he was really a meteorologist.

01:03:31.287 --> 01:03:33.620
They didn't really have that
many theoretical physicists

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.060
back in those days.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.450
But as a meteorologist,
he was an expert

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:40.629
in solving partial
differential equations,

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:42.920
and got himself interested
in general relativity, which

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.950
was a new theory at this point.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:49.547
And in 1922, he published
an actual physics paper,

01:03:49.547 --> 01:03:51.630
I think the first physics
paper he ever published,

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:52.440
and one of two.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.250
He wrote basically two papers
about the Friedman equations--

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:59.050
one for closed universes,
and one for open universes.

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.800
So the first of those
papers was published

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.440
in June 29, 1922 in the premier
physics journal of the day--

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.805
the Zeitschrift fur
Physik, a German journal.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:15.530
And almost immediately--
or a few months later,

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:18.610
when Einstein noticed
this article--

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:22.620
Einstein submitted a comment
about the article claiming

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.810
that the article was
entirely wrong, just

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:26.620
mathematically wrong.

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:30.790
And the article was titled
"Remark on the Work of A.

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:34.420
Friedmann 'On the Curvature
of Space' " by A. Einstein,

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.510
Berlin, received
September 18, 1922.

01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:40.990
Looking at these dates--
the original article

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:45.500
was received in June
1922, and Einstein

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:50.030
was responding by September
18, a few months later.

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:53.720
And this is a translation,
which comes from a book called

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.920
Cosmological Constants,
which is basically

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.330
a book of famous
articles in cosmology,

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:00.380
like Friedman's, and all
these original articles.

01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:02.546
It's a great book if you
can still get a copy of it.

01:05:02.546 --> 01:05:03.930
It's no doubt out of print.

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:08.120
It was written by Jeremy
Bernstein and Gary Feinberg.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.125
And I'm taking the
translation from there,

01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:12.930
because this was
written in German.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:14.650
I don't know German.

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:17.010
"The works cited contains
a result concerning

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:21.250
a non-stationary world
which seems suspect to me.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.380
Indeed, those
solutions do not appear

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.400
compatible with the
field equations."

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.670
And I guess A is the label
of the field equations

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:30.360
as they appeared in
Friedman's paper.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.560
"From the field equation,
it follows necessarily

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.435
that the divergence of the
matter tensor Tik vanishes."

01:05:36.435 --> 01:05:39.350
That is, energy
momentum is conserved

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:43.200
as a four-vector quantity.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.120
"This along with ansatzes C and
D"-- equations from the paper--

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.820
leads, according to Einstein,
to an equation which we can all

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:53.050
recognize the meaning of-- the
partial of rho with respect

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.000
to x sub 4-- time-- is 0.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.560
Einstein convinced himself
that the equations of general

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.140
relativity led to the conclusion
that rho cannot change with

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.280
time.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.430
And he then goes on to
say "which together with 8

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.690
implies that the world radius
R"-- that's the scale factor.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:14.594
That's what we call a of
t-- "is constant in time.

01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:16.260
The significance of
the work, therefore,

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.830
is to demonstrate
this constancy."

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.750
All Friedman does
once you correct

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.560
his equations,
according to Einstein,

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.620
was prove that the only
cosmological solution is rho

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:29.600
equals a constant, which was
Einstein's static solution.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.852
This was entirely wrong-- no
basis whatever in mathematics.

01:06:33.852 --> 01:06:35.310
But it took a while
before Einstein

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:36.715
got himself straightened out.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:39.660
And he did actually
publish this.

01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.370
The sequence of events was, June
29, Friedman submits his paper.

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:49.880
September 18, Einstein submits
his rebuttal to the paper.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:53.410
Friedman didn't learn about this
until the following December.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.960
Friedman had a friend who played
a key role in this story-- Yrui

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:02.830
Krutkov, who was visiting
in Berlin during this time.

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:08.020
And Friedman actually
learned from Krutkov

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.860
that Einstein had
submitted a rebuttal.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:15.280
So Friedman apparently was able
to track it down and read it.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.730
And he wrote a detailed
letter to Einstein

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:20.031
explaining to Einstein
what he got wrong,

01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:21.780
which is a gutsy thing
to do, but Friedman

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.827
was right in this case.

01:07:23.827 --> 01:07:26.410
But Einstein was traveling and
actually never read the letter,

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.980
at least not until much later.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.100
Then the following May,
Krutkov and Einstein

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:36.920
are both at a conference in
Leiden, a conference that they

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.735
were both attending, which was
a farewell lecture by Lorentz,

01:07:40.735 --> 01:07:44.660
who was retiring at that time.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:48.560
So they met and started
talking, and continued talking.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.320
And we know most about it
from a series of letters

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:57.790
that Krutkov wrote to his
sister back in Saint Petersburg.

01:07:57.790 --> 01:07:59.670
And according to those
letters-- and I'm now

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:03.500
quoting from a rather lovely
book called Alexander A.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:06.070
Friedmann-- The Man who
Made the Universe Expand,

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:07.760
by Tropp, Frenkel, and Chernin.

01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.780
Krutkov wrote to his sister
that on Monday, May 7,

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.790
1923, "I was reading,
together with Einstein,

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:20.069
Friedman's article in the
Zeitschrift fur Physik.

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:23.250
And then on May 18, he
wrote, "I defeated Einstein

01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:25.310
in the argument about Friedmann.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.870
Petrograd's honor is saved!"

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:30.840
Petrograd is what we now
call Saint Petersburg,

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.830
and where they were all from--
that is, Friedman and Krutkov.

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.240
And then shortly
after that, on May 31,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.279
Einstein submitted a
retraction of his refutation

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:47.840
of Friedman's paper.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.550
And the retraction
is-- again, I'm

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:52.830
quoting from Cosmological
Constant, which

01:08:52.830 --> 01:08:56.399
translates all these
nice papers into English.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:09:00.790
Einstein wrote, very briefly,
"I have in an earlier note

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:04.890
criticized the cited
work-- Friedmann 1922.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.609
My objection rested
however, as Mr. Krutkov

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:10.420
off in person and a
letter from Mr. Friedmann

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:14.000
convinced me, on a
calculational error.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
I am convinced that
Mr. Friedmann's results

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.540
are both correct and clarifying.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.720
They show that in addition
to the static solution

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.689
to the field
equations, there are

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:27.529
time varying solutions with a
spatially symmetric structure."

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:31.870
Anyway, the expanding universe
that we now talk about.

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:34.090
Einstein did have to
admit, ultimately,

01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:39.470
that algebra is algebra, and you
can't really futz with algebra.

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:42.850
And the Einstein equations
do not imply that rho cannot

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:47.160
change with time, and
that Friedman was right.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.000
There's an interesting twist
on this retraction letter.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.149
This is just a photo of
Einstein at this time period,

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.470
and Krutkov.

01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:00.270
There's an interesting twist
on the retraction letter, which

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:02.810
is that the original
draft still exists.

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:04.512
I forget what museum it's in.

01:10:04.512 --> 01:10:06.220
But it's quoted in
another marvelous book

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.803
about this history
called The Invented

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:11.542
Universe, by Pierre Kerzberg.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:15.510
And I Xeroxed this
from the book.

01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:17.030
And this is the original draft.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:21.270
And notice there
are some cross-outs.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:26.690
And the last cross-out, which
followed this explanation

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:31.270
that there is this expanding
solution-- in Einstein's

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:34.350
original draft, he wrote
but then crossed out

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:39.120
"a physical significance can
hardly be ascribed to them."

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.272
So his initial instinct,
even after having

01:10:41.272 --> 01:10:43.230
been convinced that these
were a valid solution

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:46.210
to the equations, was to say
that they couldn't possibly

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:48.900
be physical, because
they're not physical.

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.480
The universe is static.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.230
But somehow, before
he submitted it,

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:55.690
he did realize that
there wasn't actually

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:59.042
any solid logic
behind that reasoning.

01:10:59.042 --> 01:11:03.180
So logic did prevail, and
he decided that he really

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.670
had no right to say
that the solution has

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.440
no physical significance, which
is a good thing, because now,

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.356
of course, it is the
solution that we consider

01:11:10.356 --> 01:11:16.490
physically significant-- the
expanding solution of Friedman.

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:20.040
So [INAUDIBLE] is
a mystery, I think.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.697
OK, we have just a couple
minutes left in the class.

01:11:22.697 --> 01:11:24.530
So I think that is
nearly enough time for me

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.805
to at least introduce what
I want to talk about next.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:38.650
What we'll be talking about next
time-- and I'll just introduce

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:43.380
it now-- are a set of
two problems associated

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.370
with the conventional
big bang theory.

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.300
And by the conventional
bang big bang theory,

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.677
I mean basically the theory
we've been talking about,

01:11:49.677 --> 01:11:51.260
but in particular,
the big bang theory

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:53.880
without inflation, which we
will be talking about later.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.220
But so far, we've been talking
about the big bang theory

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:57.990
without inflation.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.740
And the two problems
that we'll talk about

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.350
are called the horizon
or horizon homogeneity

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:06.150
problem, and the
flatness problem.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.970
Both of these are
problems connected

01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:13.500
with the initial conditions
necessary to make the model

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.710
work.

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:21.240
So this horizon
homogeneity problem

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.840
is a problem about
trying to understand

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.800
the uniformity of the observed
universe, which we've just

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:30.000
put in as part of our
initial conditions.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.790
The model that we've
constructed was just completely

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:37.640
homogeneous and isotropic
from start to present.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.380
The evidence for the
uniformity of the universe

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.410
shows up most strongly,
as I think we said before,

01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:47.400
in the cosmic background
radiation, which

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.850
can be measured to
fantastic precision.

01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:54.390
And this radiation is known to
be uniform in all directions

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:57.260
to an accuracy of
one part in 100,000,

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:01.010
which is really a phenomenal
level of accuracy.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:03.390
Now, what makes this
hard to understand

01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:05.820
in the conventional
big bang theory is

01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:07.440
that if instead
of just putting it

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.340
in as an assumption about
the initial conditions,

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.490
you try to get it out
of any kind of dynamics,

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.630
that turns out to be impossible.

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.610
And in particular, a calculation
that we'll do next time

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:21.940
is we'll imagine
tracing back photons

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.260
from the cosmic background
radiation arriving at the Earth

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.719
today from two opposite
directions in the sky.

01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:30.760
Now, the phenomenology is
that those photons come

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.950
with exactly the same
temperature to an accuracy

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.790
of one part in
100,000, and that's

01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.920
what we're trying to explain.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.830
Now, we all do know
that systems do

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:42.470
come to a uniform temperature.

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:45.009
If you heated the air
in this room in a corner

01:13:45.009 --> 01:13:46.550
and then let the
room stand, the heat

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:48.570
would scatter
throughout the room,

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:51.459
and the room would come
to a uniform temperature.

01:13:51.459 --> 01:13:53.500
If you take a hot slice
of pizza out of the oven,

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.810
it gets cool, as
everybody knows.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:58.820
So there is this
so-called zeroth law

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:01.650
of thermodynamics which
says that everything tends

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.840
to come to a
uniform temperature.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.340
And it's a fair question to
ask, can we perhaps explain

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.460
the uniformity of the
universe by invoking

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.700
this zeroth law
of thermodynamcs?

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.770
Maybe the universe
just had time to come

01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:17.330
to a uniform temperature.

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:21.500
But one can see immediately
when one looks at details

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.480
that that's not the case.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.560
Within the context of
our conventional model

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.760
of cosmology, the
universe definitely

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.360
did not have time to come
to a uniform temperature.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.220
And the easiest way
to drive that home

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.250
will be a calculation that we
will do first thing next time,

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:40.500
which is that we will
trace back photons coming

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:42.440
from opposite
directions in the sky

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.730
and ask, what would
it take for them

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.270
to have been set equal
to the same temperature

01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:49.220
when they were first emitted?

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.990
And what we'll find is
that when we trace them

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:59.140
back to their emission sources,
that those emissions took place

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.130
at two points which were
separated from each other

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:05.370
by about 50 horizon distances.

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:08.130
So assuming that physical
influences are limited

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:10.010
by the speed of
light-- and according

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:12.600
to everything that we know about
the laws of physics, that's

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:18.120
true-- there is no way that the
emission of that photon coming

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.990
from that direction could
have had any causal connection

01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:23.590
with the emission
of the photon coming

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.510
from the other direction.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.560
So if the uniformity
had to be set up

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:30.210
by physical processes
that happened

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:33.297
after the initial singularity,
there's just no way

01:15:33.297 --> 01:15:35.130
that that emission could
have known anything

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.824
about what was
going on over there,

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:39.240
and no way they could have
arranged to be emitting photons

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.592
at the same energy
at the same time.

01:15:42.592 --> 01:15:44.050
Now, everything
does work if you're

01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:47.030
willing to just assume that
everything started at uniform.

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:48.750
But if you're not
willing to assume that,

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:52.550
and want to try to derive the
uniformity of the universe

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:54.890
as a dynamical
consequence of processes

01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:56.760
in the early
universe, there's just

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.960
no way to do it in the
conventional big bang

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.570
theory because of this
causality argument.

01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:04.531
And later, we'll see that
inflation gets around that.

01:16:04.531 --> 01:16:05.030
Yes?

01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:08.000
AUDIENCE: How do we know
that the homogeneity wasn't

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.240
just created when the
universe was smaller,

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.802
in such a way that the
speed of light limit

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:15.010
wouldn't be violated, and
that it would just maintain

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.822
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.530
PROFESSOR: OK, the
question is, how do we

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:20.530
know that the uniformity
wasn't established when

01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:23.490
the universe was very small,
and then the speed of light

01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:25.145
might not have to be violated?

01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:27.651
Well, the point is
that if the dynamics is

01:16:27.651 --> 01:16:29.650
the conventional big bang
model, what we'll show

01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:31.660
is that there's
not really enough.

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.300
No matter how early you
imagine it happening,

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.882
it still is 50 horizon
distances apart.

01:16:36.882 --> 01:16:39.340
And there's no way that those
points could've communicated,

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.895
no matter how close
you come to t equals 0.

01:16:41.895 --> 01:16:43.895
Now, you are of course
free to assuming anything

01:16:43.895 --> 01:16:47.060
you want about the
singularity at t equals 0.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.120
So if you want to just assume
that somehow the singularity

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.010
homogenized
everything, that's OK.

01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:54.440
But there's no theory behind it.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.970
That's just speculation.

01:16:56.970 --> 01:16:58.880
But it is satisfactory
speculation.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.882
There's nothing it contradicts.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:03.090
But the beauty of inflation
is that it does, in fact,

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:06.350
provide a dynamical explanation
for how this uniformity could

01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:09.820
have been created, which,
at least to many people,

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.000
is better than just
speculating that somehow it

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.166
happened in the singularity.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.170
OK, I think that's it for now.

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:19.795
I will tell you about
the other problem

01:17:19.795 --> 01:17:21.650
we'll talk about
next time next time.

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:25.360
And I will see you
all next Tuesday.
