00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.090
PROFESSOR: OK, in that
case, let's go on.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.030
At the end of last
class, we were

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.490
beginning to talk about
the Doppler shift.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.985
And we defined our terms.

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:33.360
And I guess I'll repeat the
definitions on the blackboard

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.780
here.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:43.240
We are talking initially about
the case where the observer is

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:56.950
stationary and the source is
moving with velocity v. We

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.540
are talking
initially about sound

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.910
waves, waves which have a fixed
speed relative to some medium.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.265
And the speed relative to
the medium will be called u.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.810
v will be the
velocity of recession,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.855
as shown on the diagram.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.890
Delta t sub s, s for source,
will be the time interval

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.880
between wave crests as measured
at the source-- so period

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.765
of wave at source.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:07.920
And delta t sub o
will be the period

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.700
of the wave at the observer.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.550
And what we're
trying to calculate

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.455
is the relationship
between delta t sub o

00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:23.320
and delta t sub s.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.480
OK, at this point, I'd
like to go to the screen

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.960
and go through the
different stages of what

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.680
happens as this
process takes place.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.130
We start in frame
one with an observer

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.900
in some location, a source
at some different location.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.390
Source is moving to the right.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.700
Source is emitting
the first wave crest

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.620
in this slide number one.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.780
Nothing too interesting so far.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.100
Next picture, the source
emits the second wave crest.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.340
But meanwhile, the
source has moved.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.560
The time between wave
crests as seen by the source

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.510
is delta t sub s.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.100
So the distance that the source
will move during that time

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.200
integral is v times
delta t sub s.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.220
And we'll call that delta l.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.620
And this really is
the important slide.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.990
I think I have it
highlighted here.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.880
That picture is what really
counts for the whole Doppler

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.560
shift.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.250
It says that the
second wave crest

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.080
has to travel a little further
than the first wave crest

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.705
by this amount delta l.

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:41.820
So delta l will be
the crucial quantity

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.630
that will control the answer.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.470
Third slide, the
waves have traveled.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.130
Now the first crest
in this third frame

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.545
has just hit the observer.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.290
Next frame, the last
crest, the second crest,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.840
has hit the observer.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.210
And to figure out
the Doppler shift

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.829
from those images,
all we have to do

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.180
is realize that if both
objects were stationary,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.079
there'd be no time difference
between observation and source.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.370
Each could occur later by
some fixed amount, the amount

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.800
of time it would take
the sound wave to travel.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.870
But they will occur
later by the same amount

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.370
if there was no motion.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.610
So if there's no
motion, delta t sub o

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.270
would be equal to delta t sub
s, if there was no motion.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.780
But because there
is motion, we said

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.670
that the wave, the
second crest, is

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.840
going to have to travel
further by the amount delta l.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.680
So it'll be delayed
by the amount of time

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.900
it takes for the wave
to travel delta l.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:13.490
And that's just delta
l divided by v--

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.025
so plus delta l divided by v.
And we know what delta l is.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.740
Delta l is just v
times delta t sub s.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.225
I'm sorry, this is divided by u.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.360
u is the speed of the wave.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.130
v is the speed of the source.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.830
So here we have in the
numerator v times delta t sub s,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.950
and the denominator is u.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.610
This is just what
we said delta l is.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.260
So this really is our result.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.350
It tells us what delta o is
in terms of delta t sub s.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.460
And we can solve for the ratio.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.330
It tells us that delta
t sub o over delta t

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:17.780
sub s is equal to
1 plus v over u.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.330
Solve that equation.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.760
Now there's a
standard definition

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.250
that's used to describe
redshifts, which

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.230
is that this ratio, which is
also the ratio of wavelengths,

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.230
which is how I
usually think of it,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.440
the wavelength at the
observer divided by the wave

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.610
length at the source--
the wave length

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.030
being disproportional
to the delta t.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.040
The wave ones are just the
wave speed times delta t.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.550
This is defined to
be 1 plus z where

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.625
z is what's called the redshift.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.030
And the astronomers
take out the one

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.990
so that if both objects are
stationary, z is equal to 0.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.370
That corresponds
to know redshift.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.170
That means the wave length
is the same at the source

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.830
and at the observer.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.430
So the ratio of the
wavelength as its observed

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.240
to the wavelength of the source
is what's called 1 plus z.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.000
So in this case, it
follows immediately

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.410
that the redshift for this
case is just v over u.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.360
So maybe I'll just write that
again in a box and label it.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.710
z is equal to v
over u corresponds

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:47.580
to the nonrelativistic case,
or the sound wave case,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.150
with the source moving.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.020
OK?

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.830
Everybody on board?

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.530
Any questions?

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.910
OK, straightforward
enough, I think.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.430
OK, now we will go on to do the
alternative simple case, where

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.120
the observer is moving and
the source is stationary.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.520
So keep the source on the right
and the observer on the left.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.930
But this time it's the observer
that's moving again with speed

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.700
v. So v is always for these
two cases in my notation

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.995
the relative velocity between
the source and the observer.

00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:39.790
So now we have a new
sequence of pictures.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.700
So first picture again
is fairly trivial.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.185
The first wave crest is
being emitted by the source.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.460
Picture number two,
the second wave crest

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.340
is emitted by the source.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.210
Picture number three,
the first wave crest

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.430
arrives at the source.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.690
And picture number four
now, the second wave crest

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.900
arrives at the source.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.300
And for this case,
it is this last frame

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.470
where all the action is.

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:27.150
The point is that between the
time when the first crest hits

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.650
the source and the time
when the second crest hits

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.490
the source, that is the time
between the third and fourth

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.332
frame, the source has moved.

00:09:36.332 --> 00:09:37.790
And it's moved by
distance which is

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.040
v times the time
between those images.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.630
And the time
between these images

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.100
is just the time that
the source experiences

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.531
between the receipt
of the two waves.

00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:50.780
And it's therefore what we've
been calling delta t sub

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.130
o, the time interval as
measured by the observer.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:58.960
So the distance traveled
is just v times t sub o.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.760
And it's that last frame inside
that box where all the action

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.580
happens for determining the
answer for this problem.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.210
So we can put that
into equations also.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:17.440
This time it's slightly
more complicated.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.510
It starts basically
with the same idea.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.560
Delta t sub o is
equal to delta t sub

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.980
s, which is what it would
be if there was no motion.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.620
But it's a little bit longer
because of the extra distance

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.450
the second pulse travels.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.710
And that extra distance
is again called delta l.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:40.370
So the time delay is again delta
l divided by u, the wave speed.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.030
But this time we have a
different formula for delta l.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.660
This time delta l is v times
delta t sub 0, instead of

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.285
last time it was v
times delta t sub s.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.980
So this time the equation
is ever so slightly more

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.950
complicated, because
delta t sub 0

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.042
appears on both sides
of the equation.

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:14.500
Last time we
immediately wrote down

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.620
an equation for delta t sub o.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.710
But nonetheless, this is one
equation with one unknown,

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.730
so of course it's trivial to
solve it for delta t sub o.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.820
And when we do that,
we get delta t sub o.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.704
I'll maybe divide
by delta t sub s.

00:11:33.704 --> 00:11:35.620
By just doing a little
bit of algebra on that,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.850
you discover it's 1
minus u over v inverse.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:57.170
And then z, the redshift, is
delta t sub 0 over delta t sub

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.130
s minus 1 by definition.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.620
AUDIENCE: Is that
1 minus v over u?

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.370
PROFESSOR: Oh, do I
have it wrong here?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.510
Yes, it's 1 minus v over u.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.420
Thank you very much.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.110
Right, coming from
the v over u here,

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.790
obviously, as you noticed.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.220
OK, so to write down a
final equation for z,

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.960
it's delta t0 over
delta t sub s minus 1.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:42.240
So it's 1 minus v over
u inverse minus 1.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.150
And then just putting things
over our common denominator,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:54.390
it ends up being v over u
divided by 1 minus v over u.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.480
And that then is
our final answer.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.680
So this now is the answer for
the nonrelativistic case--

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:09.550
again, we haven't
done relativity yet--

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.040
and the observer moving.

00:13:37.434 --> 00:13:41.380
OK, now it's worth
pointing out that when

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.182
velocity is small compared
to the wave speed,

00:13:44.182 --> 00:13:45.640
as is often the
case if we're going

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.820
to be talking about
light which we'll

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.500
be talking about in
a minute, but could

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.880
be the case with respect
to sound as well.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.730
Then these two formulas
are almost the same.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:56.024
They're both
proportional to v over u,

00:13:56.024 --> 00:13:57.940
when I'm talking about
the case where v over u

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.900
is a small quantity, where
the motion is slow compared

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.880
to the sound speed
or wave speed.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.800
And the only difference
is that denominator.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.810
Here we have a denominator
of 1 minus v over u.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.690
And here the v over
u is the whole show.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.350
There's no denominator.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.500
And if v over u is small, the
denominator is close to 1.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.970
So the two answers are
going to be almost the same.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:28.390
And one can describe that a
little bit more succinctly

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:36.800
perhaps, by saying that z with
the observer moving minus z

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:52.680
with the source moving is equal
to v over u quantity squared

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.360
times 1 minus v over
u in the denominator.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.695
Just a little bit of
algebra to get that result.

00:14:59.695 --> 00:15:01.070
And what that
shows explicitly is

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.890
that second order in v over u.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.070
It's proportional to v over
u squared, not to v over u.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:09.420
So if v over u were
a part in 1,000,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.020
the difference would
be a part in a million.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.877
So for slow
velocities, it doesn't

00:15:13.877 --> 00:15:15.710
matter whether it's the
source that's moving

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.156
or the observer that's moving.

00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:18.530
But these answers
can, of course,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:24.080
be very different if the
velocity v is comparable to u.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.130
OK, any questions about that?

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:30.946
Yes?

00:15:30.946 --> 00:15:33.360
AUDIENCE: Does this violate
Galilean relativity?

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.570
PROFESSOR: Does it violate
Galilean relativity?

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.050
Not really.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.370
Although, one has to maybe be
careful about how one defines

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.960
Galilean relativity.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.070
What makes it legitimate
as a classical mechanical

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.900
calculation is that
unshown, but crucially

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.350
important on the
blackboard, is the air

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.120
that the sound wave
is moving through.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.310
So in one of these pictures,
the air was at rest.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.170
The other picture,
the air was moving.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.780
Or rather, well,
I said that wrong.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.680
The air was at rest
in both pictures.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.740
But if you want to make
a Galilean transformation

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.645
to relate one
picture to the other,

00:16:07.645 --> 00:16:09.770
then after you've made the
Galilean transformation,

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.728
the air would be moving
and it would not really

00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:13.220
be the same picture.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.056
So it is all consistent
with Galilean relativity.

00:16:16.056 --> 00:16:17.680
And one has to remember
that the air is

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.050
playing a crucial role here.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.420
When we say that the observer
or the source is at rest,

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.995
the full sentence
really is that it's

00:16:24.995 --> 00:16:28.330
at rest relative to the medium
that's transporting the wave.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.670
Any other questions?

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.943
Yes?

00:16:35.943 --> 00:16:37.817
AUDIENCE: This is not
really a question, just

00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:38.775
kind of an observation.

00:16:38.775 --> 00:16:41.590
I just find it interesting
that in the case

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:46.935
if v is greater than u that
this one is always positive,

00:16:46.935 --> 00:16:47.435
no problem.

00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:49.566
But if v is greater than
u in the other case,

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:52.100
then you have a
negative number, which,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.900
I don't know if that--
I just find that weird.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.390
PROFESSOR: Right, let me think.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:13.079
If v is greater than u, then
the observer moving case

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.150
becomes negative.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.360
And it presumably means
the wave never reaches it.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.180
If the observer is moving
faster than the wave speed,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.510
the wave never reaches them.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.079
And that's why the
answer is peculiar.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.230
If the source is moving
faster than the wave speed,

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.570
the wave still
reaches the observer.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.970
So there is a nontrivial and
believable answer in that case.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.620
OK.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:46.320
What we're going to move on to
now is the relativistic case.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.510
And as I think I described in
the course handouts, relativity

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.500
is has sort of an odd
role in this class.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.890
We need a little
bit of relativity.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.780
But at the same time, there
are the courses in relativity.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.570
So I don't want this to
be a course in relativity.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.200
In the old days,
when there weren't so

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.900
many other courses
in relativity,

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.110
we did in fact spend two
weeks of this course doing

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.187
special relativity.

00:18:09.187 --> 00:18:11.020
But I don't think that's
worthwhile anymore.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.800
Well, I'll maybe ask
for a show of hands.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.258
How many of you
have had relativity

00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:15.400
in some other course?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.687
That's what I thought, most
of you, perhaps not all.

00:18:17.687 --> 00:18:19.520
Well, maybe I should
ask the other question.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.260
How many of you have
not had relativity?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.581
OK, a number.

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:25.330
So I do want to make
the course completely

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.380
intelligible to the people
in that second group.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.940
Special relativity is not a
prerequisite for this class.

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.480
So what my goal will be
to tell you enough special

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.270
relativity so that you'll be
able to follow what comes next.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.740
But I will not be
driving those results.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.765
I'll just leave
for other courses

00:18:44.765 --> 00:18:46.140
for people who
want to take them.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.306
And if you don't want to
take them, that's fine too.

00:18:48.306 --> 00:18:51.000
But I want to make
this course coherent.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.870
So what we're going to do
is discuss the consequences

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.990
of special relativity
without trying

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.950
to relate those
consequences directly

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.860
to the underlying ideas
of special relativity.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:08.230
I will, however, mention where
special relativity comes from.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.580
It arose in the mind
of Albert Einstein,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:18.790
because he realized that the
physics that we knew well,

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.560
basically Newtonian
physics at that time,

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.080
possess this property, Galilean
relativity, which came up

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.190
in a question just a minute ago.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.330
Galilean relativity
says that if you

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.000
look at any given physical
process in a frame that's

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.780
moving at a uniform velocity
relative to the first frame

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.240
that you use to describe
it, it should also

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.200
be consistent with the laws of
physics in the second frame.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.460
Incidentally, I-- maybe I'm
more ignorant about history

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.820
than most-- only learned
a few years ago what

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.441
Galileo had to do with this.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:53.190
It did actually play
a very important role

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.900
in the history of
Galileo in the physics

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.720
that he was debating about.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.782
A key issue in the
time of Galileo

00:19:59.782 --> 00:20:02.240
was whether the earth moved
around the sun or the sun moved

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.750
around the earth.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:11.250
And that was something Galileo
was intensely involved in.

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.060
And one of the
arguments that said

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.710
that it must be the
sun that moves--

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.277
it can't be the
earth that moves--

00:20:16.277 --> 00:20:17.860
was that if it's the
earth that moves,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.184
it means we move at
very high velocity.

00:20:20.184 --> 00:20:21.850
The velocity of the
earth around the sun

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.870
is high by ordinary standards.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:28.680
And obviously, we'd feel
that motion, people thought.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.322
So it was a proof
that it must be

00:20:30.322 --> 00:20:32.280
that the earth is stationary
and the sun moves.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.250
Because otherwise, we'd feel
the effect of this high velocity

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.610
motion.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.560
So it was crucial to
Galileo's point of view

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.030
that it was really
the earth that

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.980
was moving that you
don't detect motion.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.590
If you're in uniform
motion, the laws of physics

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.030
are exactly the same as they
would be if you were at rest.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.680
And that's basically
what Galilean relativity

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.490
is all about.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.890
And it was in fact very
clearly enunciated by Galileo

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.080
in his writings.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.770
So that was the
case for mechanics.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.000
But at the same
time, in the 1860s,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.820
Maxwell invented
Maxwell's equations,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.860
or completed them is maybe
a more accurate description

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.530
for what Maxwell really did.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.370
Most of those equations
already existed.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.230
And a prediction of
Maxwell's equations

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.800
is that light travels at
some fixed speed, which

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.630
could be calculated in terms
of epsilon naught and mu

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:27.530
naught that appeared in
those equations, a speed

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.790
that we call c.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.910
Now if light travels
at speed c, it

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.380
would mean that if you
got into a spaceship

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.610
and chased a light beam, it'd
say half the speed of light.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:40.537
The implication of the physics
that was known at the time

00:21:40.537 --> 00:21:42.370
would have been that,
from the point of view

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.840
of that spaceship traveling
at half the speed of light,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.690
the light pulse would
only be receding

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.040
at half the speed of light.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.060
You would have half
caught up with it.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.560
But that would mean that from
the frame of this rapidly

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.680
moving spaceship,
the laws of physics

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.860
must somehow be different.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.080
Maxwell's equations must not
hold in their standard form.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.070
So there was this tension
between Maxwell and Newton,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.180
if you like.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.150
The tension was not
a contradiction.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.850
It would be perfectly
possible for there

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:17.600
to be a fixed frame in which
Maxwell's equations had

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.230
their simple form.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.910
But Newton's equations
could perhaps

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.280
have the same form
in all frames.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.860
And that in fact was what
people thought at the time.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.570
To account for this situation,
physicists invented the idea

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.210
of an ether which was a medium
through which light waves

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:39.910
travelled, similar to the air
in which sound waves traveled.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:44.490
And the frame in which Maxwell's
equations had their simple form

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.870
was the rest frame of the ether.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.790
And if you moved relative
ether, the equations

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.860
would be different.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:54.704
And that's what people
thought in 1904.

00:22:54.704 --> 00:22:57.790
And it was a consistent
point of view,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.240
but it meant that there
was this dichotomy

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.360
between electromagnetism
and mechanics.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.000
So Einstein thought maybe
physics is not so sloppy.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.520
Maybe there's a more elegant
way which all this plays out.

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.290
And he realized that if you
modified the equations that

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.310
are used to transform between
one frame and another,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.555
you could make Maxwell's
equations frame invariant.

00:23:27.555 --> 00:23:29.430
You could make it so
that Maxwell's equations

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.390
are valid in all frames.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.240
And if we go back to our
example of the spaceship chasing

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:38.100
the light beam, with these
new transformation equations

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.780
that Einstein suggested,
it would turn out,

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:44.660
even though it's very
contrary to intuition,

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.752
that when the spaceship measures
the speed of the light pulse,

00:23:47.752 --> 00:23:50.210
it would still measure that
the light pulse was moving away

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.360
at speed c, even though it
had moved at half c trying

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.634
to catch up with
the light pulse.

00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:58.300
So it's not obvious
how that can happen.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.591
But it turns out it can happen.

00:23:59.591 --> 00:24:02.010
We'll be talking a little bit
more about how it happens.

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.970
And that was basically
Einstein's proposal.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.580
It was a proposal that
there is no ether,

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.180
that the laws of physics both
electromagnetism and mechanics

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.080
are the same in all frames.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.890
And in order to do
that, he had to say

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.150
that the equations
of transformation

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.270
between one frame
and another are

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.560
different from what
Galileo believed.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.640
So these are what we call
the Lorentz transformations.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.526
We might write them down
later in the course,

00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:29.400
but we're not going to
write them down today.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.800
But what goes into them
are three physical effects,

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.840
which we will talk about.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.810
If we're talking about
the time dilation,

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:39.430
we only need one of
those three effects.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.920
So I'm going to start by just
discussing that for a minute,

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.940
and then we'll come back at the
end of the class, or perhaps

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.600
next class, depending
on how timing works out,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.830
to discuss the other
two primary effects that

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.500
are needed to make up the
theory of special relativity

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.329
and explain how it could
be that the speed of light

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:58.870
could look the same
to all observers,

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.870
even if we're talking about
observers that might be moving.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.850
OK, so time dilation
is the simple statement

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.830
that if I were to
watch a moving clock,

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:17.490
the moving clock would appear
to me to be running slower.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.780
I'll just mention
for a moment now

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.975
that I put the word
appear in quotation marks.

00:25:22.975 --> 00:25:25.350
That means we're going to come
back and discuss in detail

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.920
what is meant by
the word appear.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.470
But to finish the
sentence first,

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:36.450
the moving clock would appear
to me in my reference frame

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.880
to always be running slower.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.930
And so by a very predictable
amount, a famous expression

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.970
in special relativity,
gamma, where

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.470
gamma is 1 over the
square root of 1

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.715
minus beta squared, where beta
is just an abbreviation for v

00:25:52.715 --> 00:25:54.830
over c, the velocity
of the clock

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.270
divided by the speed of light.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.550
So as long as v over c is
small, this is a small effect.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.850
Gamma is near 1.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.347
And running slowly
by a factor of 1

00:26:03.347 --> 00:26:04.760
means not running slowly at all.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.210
So the fact it was near 1
means it's a very small effect.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.830
But moving clocks will always
appear to be running slower.

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.010
That's one of these three
effects of special relativity

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.910
that we'll be discussing in the
course of lecture notes one.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:22.990
Now let me come back now
to talk about this word

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:26.695
"appear," because that's
a little bit subtle.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.320
Might just add that
there was a series-- this

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.290
is just an aside-- but I
guess broadcast last year

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.080
there was a four-part
series of Brian Greene's

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.820
Fabric of the Cosmos that
was broadcast on PBS.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.280
And the interesting thing about
that, which is relevant here,

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.220
is that he tried to
illustrate time dilation.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.560
And he did it by having sort
of a parable of a person

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.750
sitting in a chair
and somebody else

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.960
carrying a clock over
his head, walking

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.140
towards the person
sitting in the chair.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.130
And the camera showed what the
person sitting in the chair

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.360
would see and showed the
clock running slowly.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.150
That's wrong.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.920
It's not what he
would actually see.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.490
And that's the crucial issue
of the word "appear" here.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.290
When we say that the clock
appears to run slowly,

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:25.510
we're not talking about what
an observer would actually see.

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.479
The complication
of literally seeing

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:30.520
is that when you see
something, what you're doing

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.990
is you're measuring the
light pulses as they arrive

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.180
at your eyes at a given time.

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:39.547
And since light has
a finite travel time,

00:27:39.547 --> 00:27:41.380
it means that you're
seeing different things

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.480
at different times.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.920
In particular, if there's
a large object coming

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.120
towards you, say this laser
pointer coming towards me,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.860
I would be seeing
the front of it

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.840
at an earlier time than I
would be seeing the back of it.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.281
The other way around, actually.

00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:00.030
I'd be seeing the back
at an earlier time,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.238
because the light that leaves
here at an earlier time

00:28:02.238 --> 00:28:04.720
would take longer to
reach my eye, reach my eye

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.230
the same time as light which
leaves the front of the object

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.460
later.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.570
So the point is that as
this is coming toward me,

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.630
I'm seeing different
pieces of it

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.570
at different times in terms
of the actual existence

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.730
of this laser pointer.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.260
And that makes
things complicated.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.940
So what you actually see
when you take into account

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.226
special relativity is
fairly complicated.

00:28:29.226 --> 00:28:30.600
You can calculate
it, but there's

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.935
no simple expression for it.

00:28:31.935 --> 00:28:33.560
You really just have
to calculate point

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.090
by point what you'll be seeing
for every part of the object

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.980
at a given time,
nothing very simple.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.730
So the simple expression,
which just says,

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.950
clocks run slowly by
a factor of gamma,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.610
and we'll learn
later e expressions

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.880
about how things
contract and how

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:50.680
simultaneity changes,
those simple expressions

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.630
are not based on what any
observer would actually see.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.180
But rather, they're
based on what

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.310
ends up giving a simpler
picture, a picture in which you

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.720
imagine that what
we're discussing

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.030
is not what an individual
sees but rather what

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.109
a frame of reference sees.

00:29:07.109 --> 00:29:09.150
So we're talking not about
what the observer sees

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.170
but rather what is seen in the
observer's frame of reference.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.030
And a frame of
reference, I think

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.110
you could think of it
pretty concretely, as kind

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:22.170
of a structure of rulers
connected together

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.690
to each other to
form a grid of rulers

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:29.300
and with clocks located
everywhere along this grid.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.440
So all the observations
are made locally.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.440
That is, if you want to measure
a time in a given reference

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.590
frame, you don't use a
central clock, waiting

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.725
for the light pulse to
reach that central clock.

00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:41.350
Rather, you measure
the reference frame

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.270
is filled with
clocks, all of which

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.590
have been synchronized
to start with.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.970
And if you want to know
what time an event happens,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.480
you look at the clock
that's next to it.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.739
And that clock tells you what
time that event happened.

00:29:54.739 --> 00:29:56.280
So that's typically
what we draw when

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.250
we draw a coordinate
systems and so on.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.802
It's really the way
we normally think.

00:30:01.802 --> 00:30:03.260
The point is,
though, if you really

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.360
want to think what one
observer would see,

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.550
it's more complicated.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.850
Then you have to take into
account the light travel time.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.190
So it's only after you take
out the way travel time

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.550
and calculate how local
clocks would compare

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.560
that you see this time
dilation in the simple form,

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.959
that the clock
always runs slower.

00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:22.375
So in particular,
for this example

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:24.090
of the person sitting
in a chair and the clock

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.590
coming towards them,
that's exactly what

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.340
we're going to be talking about.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.940
That is the Doppler shift.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.440
And what we'll find is when
the clock comes towards them,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.440
he will see the
blueshift not a redshift.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.930
He'll see the clock
running faster not slower,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.650
the opposite of what was
shown in the TV program.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.220
But the difference
is that what causes

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.820
it to look like
it's going faster

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.320
is the fact that each pulse
travels a shorter distance

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.920
if the clock is coming
towards the observer.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.960
And that becomes a bigger
effect than the fact

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.360
the clock itself, if it were
measured relative to clocks

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.900
that it passes, would
be running slowly.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:57.631
Yes?

00:30:57.631 --> 00:30:59.101
AUDIENCE: So in that case,
if the clock, let's say,

00:30:59.101 --> 00:31:00.517
was moving toward
you really fast,

00:31:00.517 --> 00:31:03.150
could you measure it when it was
directly perpendicular to you?

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.397
And then that would be the
special relativity time

00:31:05.397 --> 00:31:06.791
dilation?

00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:08.790
PROFESSOR: Well, if it
was moving alongside you.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.070
If it was coming right at
you, it would just hit you.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.280
And that was the case,
Sonya, more or less.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.190
But yes, you're exactly right.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.190
If the clock were moving at
right angles to the observer

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:23.000
so that the observer
saw it, what you really

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.540
want for this to
be the pure effect

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.380
is you want to have the
velocity of the clock

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.450
to be perpendicular to
the velocity of the photon

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:37.250
that the observer is seeing,
as measured in the observer's

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.010
reference frame.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.900
Actually that matters.

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.380
Then you see would see
pure time dilation effect.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.800
That's exactly right.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:55.000
OK, so might just add that Brian
Green and a bunch of people

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.600
here at MIT, actually--
I was involved

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600
and so were some others.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.150
There's a number of MIT
people on this program.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.540
So we ended up having
a long conversation

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.290
with Brian Green
about it by email.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.427
And everybody at MIT thought
it was just plain wrong.

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:11.010
Brian Green actually
took the position

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.730
that it was very
intentional on his part,

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:15.550
and he was just trying to
illustrate the time dilation

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.420
effect, and he didn't want to
talk about the Doppler shift.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.170
And since he didn't
want to talk about it,

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.170
he could ignore the
fact that it was there.

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:23.740
We all thought that
was bad pedagogy.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.950
But we never convinced
Brian, I should say.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:35.160
OK, now what we want to do is
go through these Doppler shift

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:39.000
calculations again,
this time recognizing

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.330
that moving clocks run
slowly by a factor of gamma.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.910
So we're now going to be doing
the relativistic case where

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.970
the wave is sound
waves-- excuse me,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.820
where the wave is light waves.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:50.870
I'll get this straight.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.120
And the velocities might
be comparable to the speed

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:53.660
of light.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.350
So this time dilation
effect is large

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.410
enough so that we want
to take it into account.

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.220
Now in this case,
what we are hoping,

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.080
and everything would be wrong,
inconsistent, if we can find

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.090
this, we're hoping
that in this case,

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.020
the two answers
should be the same.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.830
It shouldn't matter whether
the source is moving

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.960
or the observer is moving.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.590
Earlier it did matter, and
we said that was explicable,

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:20.280
because we knew that
air was involved.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.680
And if we made a
velocity transformation

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.874
to go from one
picture to the other,

00:33:27.874 --> 00:33:30.290
from the picture where the
source is moving to the picture

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.800
where the observer
was moving, the air

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.075
would have a different
velocity in the two pictures.

00:33:35.075 --> 00:33:37.730
It would be stationary in
one and moving in the other.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.230
So we would not expect
to get the same answer

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.680
as we would have gotten
assuming the air was stationary.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.217
But in this case, if anything
has a different velocity when

00:33:47.217 --> 00:33:49.300
you go from the picture
where the source is moving

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.460
to the picture where
the observer is moving,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.310
it would have to be the ether
that has a different velocity.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.580
But the basic axiom
of special relativity

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.490
is that there is
no ether, at least

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.620
there's no physical effects
coming from the ether.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.065
So you might as well
pretend it does not exist.

00:34:03.065 --> 00:34:04.690
You can't really
prove that it does not

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.420
exist if it has no properties.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.990
It still exists.

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.270
But the basic axiom
of special relativity

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:12.870
is that there are
no physical effects

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.196
coming from this either.

00:34:14.196 --> 00:34:16.570
So for special relativity, we
should get the same answer,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.111
whether it's the
source that's moving

00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:19.530
or the observer that's moving.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.699
It's really the same
situation, just viewed

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.150
in different reference frames.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.139
And special relativity says it
cannot matter what reference

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:29.590
frame we're doing
the calculations in.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.679
So it's the same
pictures, but this time we

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:36.600
want to take into account the
fact that moving clocks run

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.820
slowly by a factor of gamma.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.400
So looking at these
pictures, we can first

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.060
start just glancing
at them and saying,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.560
where's there a
clock that's moving?

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.719
That might be something
we need to think about.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:58.990
And maybe I'll ask you--
which of these four frames

00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.915
shows a moving clock?

00:35:06.134 --> 00:35:07.630
AUDIENCE: All of them?

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:08.844
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:35:08.844 --> 00:35:09.760
AUDIENCE: All of them?

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.280
PROFESSOR: All of
them, I guess so.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.440
But the time interval
measured on the clock

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.612
is only actually
relevant to one of them.

00:35:16.612 --> 00:35:17.920
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.070
PROFESSOR: Two, exactly, two.

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.380
Here we said that
the source is moving,

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.320
and we said the time measured
on the source's clock

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.650
between the emission of
these two wave crests.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.720
Incidentally, we're
usually talking

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.740
about continuous waves
like light waves.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.750
And then we're talking about
the time between successive wave

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.720
crests.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.220
Well, if we just as well imagine
that the source is emitting

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.590
a series of pulses where
each pulse represents a wave

00:35:45.590 --> 00:35:48.290
crest, and somehow to me
that sounds a little simpler

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:49.840
to describe, because
you don't have

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.330
to think about the sine wave
associated with the signal

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:56.780
that the source is
actually creating.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.040
So in any case, the time
between these pulses,

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.340
I'll call them, as measured
by the source clock,

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:06.590
is what we call
delta t sub s, is

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.650
the time that the source
would actually measure.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.630
And the source is
moving in this picture.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.570
So relative to
our frame, we want

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.410
to think of this entire
series of pictures

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:22.150
as all being consistent
in our frame.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.700
It's very important, since
transformations between frames

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.750
are a little complicated
in special relativity.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.990
It's very important when
you're doing any problem

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.246
to pick what frame you're going
to use for your description

00:36:33.246 --> 00:36:34.370
and be sure to stick to it.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.080
If anything is initially
described in another frame,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.890
you have to figure out what
it looks like in your frame

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.100
in order to fit it together
with the other events

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.690
that you're describing in your
own particular reference frame.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.160
So for this problem,
our frame will

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.750
be the frame of the
slide, the frame, which

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:51.910
is at rest relative
to the observer.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.770
So we could also call
it the observer's frame.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.510
And relative to that frame,
the source is moving.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.930
And therefore, the
clock-- a source

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.390
is emitting a series of pulses.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.340
That's a clock.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.030
Anything that does anything at
regular intervals is a clock.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.320
So the source represents
a moving clock.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:11.810
And we need to take into account
the fact that the source will

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.150
be running slowly by
a factor of gamma.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.920
And otherwise, nothing changes.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.350
The observer has a clock
also, which the observer

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:23.169
is going to use to measure
the time between crests.

00:37:23.169 --> 00:37:25.210
But the observer's clock
is at rest in our frame.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:28.490
So there's no time dilation
associated with the observer's

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:32.110
clock, only a time
dilation associated

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:36.050
with the clock on the source.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.630
So again, the important issue
is all inside that yellow box.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.180
And what do I do now is
look at the equations

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.305
and see how the
equations are modified.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.244
I guess I should start
back at the beginning

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.035
of the blackboards.

00:38:24.462 --> 00:38:26.170
Maybe I should turn
the blackboard lights

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.545
on when I work on
the blackboard.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:42.260
So the time integral
as seen by the observer

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:48.510
will be equal to--
last time we just

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:52.800
had delta t sub s as our first
term, which would be what it

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.630
would be if there
was no velocity.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:58.300
And that's still true if
there was no velocity.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.710
But if the clock is going
to be running slowly

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:06.130
by a factor of gamma, that would
mean that the time interval

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:07.660
that we would
measure, even if there

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.370
was no change in path length,
which will be the next term,

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:12.310
if there was no
change in path length,

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.870
the time that we would
measure as the observer would

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.830
be different from
the time interval

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.291
as measured by the source
by a factor of gamma.

00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:22.290
But one has to figure out
whether the gamma goes

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:26.010
in the numerator
or the denominator.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.470
And sometimes it's
a little tricky.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:30.880
It helps a lot, I think, to
just sort of imagine an example.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.750
Any example is
clear, it turns out.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.110
But when you try to write
down the answer in general,

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.830
you sometimes get it wrong.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:40.020
That's my experience with
myself and with other people.

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.410
So this clock is wanting slower.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.570
And say we're talking about
a second time interval.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.570
If this clock is running slower,
it means it takes longer for it

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.870
to take off a second.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:52.660
We would see it as maybe running
slower by a factor of two.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.368
It would mean that it
would only take off

00:39:54.368 --> 00:39:56.530
a second every two seconds.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.010
So that means that the time
interval that we would see--

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.760
and that's what we're
trying to calculate,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.060
the time interval
as the observer--

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:08.310
is going to be longer than delta
t sub s by a factor of gamma.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.470
So the first term changes
from what it was before.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.960
And what we're doing is we're
rewriting this equation.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.510
So the first term
changes from what

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:29.720
it was before by putting in a
factor of gamma in front of it.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.960
Because the source
clock is running slowly.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.610
And then the second term is
still delta l divided by u.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.670
But the equation for
delta l changes also,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:45.795
because delta l is
the time interval

00:40:45.795 --> 00:40:48.170
that it takes for the light
to travel the extra distance,

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.770
where the extra
distance was because

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.130
of the time between the clicks.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.470
And that is now changed
because of the time

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.110
dilation of the source clock.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.100
So the second term also
changes by a factor of gamma.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.640
So it's gamma
times delta t sub s

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:16.510
plus v times gamma times
delta t sub s divided by u.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.060
So the whole answer just
changes by a factor of gamma.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:32.120
So it's gamma times 1 plus v
over c times delta t sub s.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.550
And now if you do a
little bit of arithmetic

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.160
here-- gamma, remember, is
1 over the square root of 1

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.670
minus v squared over c squared.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:47.780
And a squared minus
b squared-- I'm now

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.524
thinking of the denominator 1
minus v squared over c squared.

00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:51.940
Maybe I'll write
this on the side.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.060
1 minus v squared
over c squared--

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.940
it's worth remembering here--
can be written as 1 plus v over

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.340
c times 1 minus v over c.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:13.760
And we have the square
root of that appearing here

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.490
in the denominator.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.000
Gamma is 1 over the
square root of this.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.190
So this becomes the square
root in the denominator,

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.100
resulting the square
root of 1 plus v

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:25.730
over c appearing in the answer.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.850
And this remains
in the denominator.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:35.720
And what we get simplifies
to simply 1 plus beta over 1

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.470
minus beta inside the square
root times delta t sub s.

00:42:45.100 --> 00:43:03.214
So this is the special
relativity answer,

00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:06.830
the relativistic answer, and
this is for the source moving.

00:43:17.776 --> 00:43:19.650
Now we expect that the
answer won't depend on

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:21.340
whether the source
is moving or not,

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.180
but certainly the
calculations do.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.889
So this is what we got from the
calculation, which we assumed

00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:27.430
that it was a source
that was moving,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.717
and the observer was stationary.

00:43:29.717 --> 00:43:31.550
It's just corrected
from the previous answer

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:33.820
by this factor of gamma.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.910
Any questions about that?

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.550
OK, so to summarize on
the slide what's changed

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:52.110
is that this time interval,
this extra distance delta l

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:56.090
for the relativistic
problem, is not

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:58.560
v times delta t sub s as it was.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.280
But rather what we said is
that it's gamma times v times

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.800
delta s, because the
clock on the source

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.040
is running slowly by
a factor of gamma.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.160
And it was this
difference that we just

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.044
used on the calculation
on the blackboard

00:44:10.044 --> 00:44:10.960
to get the new answer.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:20.450
OK now the next
calculation, now we're

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.690
going to do the same
calculation again,

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.150
which we already did for
the nonrelativistic case.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.790
But this time it will
be the observer moving.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.600
And we're going to try to
do the relativistic case.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.950
So this time it's
the clock carried

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.350
by the observer
that's running slowly.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.900
And remember, this
is running slowly

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.080
relative to us, relative to
our frame of reference, where

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.510
our frame of reference is
by definition the frame

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:46.540
of reference of the slide
that we're looking at.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.540
Source is stationary,
so delta t sub

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.330
s is just an honest time
as we would measure it.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:59.000
But times as measured by
the observer, delta t sub o,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.970
are going to be different.

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.690
So to correct the
calculation for relativity,

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.950
that's the crucial
box as it was even

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.076
in the nonrelativistic case.

00:45:09.076 --> 00:45:10.450
And we're going
to have to change

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:14.920
that equation by
replacing delta l.

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:21.210
Instead of v times delta t sub
0 is v times delta t prime.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:26.630
Now delta t prime is not
exactly delta t sub 0

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.680
or gamma times delta t sub 0.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.981
It's a little trickier.

00:45:30.981 --> 00:45:31.480
Let's see.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.660
Hold on.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:35.400
The definition I want
to use for delta t prime

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.090
is that it's the
time as measured

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.310
between the third frame
and the fourth frame.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.152
But it's the time
as we measure it.

00:45:41.152 --> 00:45:42.610
I still want to
describe everything

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.120
in terms of the way
we would measure it.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.120
So delta t sub prime
is not measured either

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.390
by the source or the observer.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.320
It's measured by us.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:01.060
And it's related to the time as
the observer would measure it

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.540
by a factor of gamma,
because relative to us,

00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:08.252
the observer's clock is running
slowly by a factor of gamma.

00:46:08.252 --> 00:46:10.325
AUDIENCE: So we're the source?

00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:11.700
PROFESSOR: Well,
we're stationary

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.210
relative to the source, because
the source is stationary.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:15.580
But we're the frame of
reference of the slide,

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.165
is the way I like
to think about it.

00:46:17.165 --> 00:46:18.540
But it is the
frame of reference,

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.590
same as the frame of
reference as the source.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.500
That's right.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.655
So delta t sub 0 is
related to delta t

00:46:26.655 --> 00:46:28.334
sub prime by a factor of gamma.

00:46:28.334 --> 00:46:30.000
And again, one has
to think a little bit

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.470
to make sure one gets the
gamma in the right place,

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.760
the numerator or
the denominator.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.796
We're saying that the
observer clock appears

00:46:37.796 --> 00:46:40.690
to be running slowly
relative to us.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:45.800
And that means that
during the amount of time

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.620
it would take for it to
say take off one second,

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.190
since it's running slowly,
should take more than a

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.184
second relative to us.

00:46:57.184 --> 00:46:58.850
And that's what this
formula would give,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:00.010
if we multiply by gamma.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.400
It would say that delta t
prime is equal to gamma times

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.870
delta t sub 0.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:07.390
So we would say that the time
that the observer clock ticks

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.650
off one second we might
measure two seconds.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.680
That's the direction
of the time shift,

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.990
all given by that formula.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.080
And those are all the pictures.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.810
Now we just have to write
down the equations that

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:21.944
go with those pictures.

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:23.860
And the hope is that
we'll get the same answer

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.176
as we got last time.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:28.410
I think I'll leave
that on the board.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:28.910
Let's see.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.774
What do I do?

00:47:31.774 --> 00:47:33.190
No, I won't leave
it on the board.

00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:50.870
OK, this time the
calculation we're mimicking

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.640
is the calculation up here.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.540
This was the calculation we had
for the nonrelativistic case

00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.900
where the observer was moving.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.470
Now we want to put in
the time dilation that

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.090
would correct that calculation.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:11.920
And the key equation is
that the time interval

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.710
between the receipt
of the two wave crests

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:17.690
as we would measure
it, which is why

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.244
I call it delta t
sub prime, so prime

00:48:20.244 --> 00:48:21.660
is not the source
or the observer.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.360
It's us.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.430
It's the same frame of
reference as the source,

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.510
but the source
isn't located there.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:28.160
So we think of it
as the time interval

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.950
as measured in the
frame of reference.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:35.200
That's the frame of the
slide, which is our frame.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:43.460
And it is equal to
gamma times delta t sub

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:46.110
0, where delta t sub 0 is
the time as it would actually

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:49.006
be measured on the
observer's clock.

00:48:49.006 --> 00:48:52.070
So, we're keeping
their labels s and 0

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:53.780
to mean what would
actually be measured

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.180
on the clocks at the
source and at the observer.

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.800
That's what we're
trying to establish

00:48:58.800 --> 00:48:59.758
a relationship between.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.630
So the basic formula
that we have up

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:15.670
top there would first
become delta t sub 0

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:21.370
is equal to-- hold on.

00:49:25.991 --> 00:49:27.990
Now actually, we would
not start by writing down

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.964
an equation for delta t sub 0.

00:49:29.964 --> 00:49:31.380
Rather what we
want to do is start

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.504
by writing down the
relationship as we would see it

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:36.100
in our frame, which is going
involve delta t sub prime.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.000
We'll worry about
delta t sub 0 later.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.350
So our equation
is going to become

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:50.710
delta t prime is equal to
delta t sub s plus v times

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:54.522
delta t sub prime divided
by the wave speed,

00:49:54.522 --> 00:49:55.980
which now we'll
call c, since we're

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.188
doing a relativistic problem.

00:50:00.141 --> 00:50:02.140
So this is the basic
equation for the time delay

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.240
as we would see it in our frame,
where delta t sub prime is

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.525
the time between the receipt
of the first and second crests,

00:50:08.525 --> 00:50:11.880
the time between
frames three and four

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.198
as we would measure it.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:20.070
And now we can do the same
thing that we did over there,

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:22.050
first for delta t sub prime.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.180
And we discover that
delta t sub prime

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.920
can be written as 1
minus v over c inverse,

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:36.140
just doing algebra on this
equation, times delta t sub s.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.570
So that equation relates delta
t prime to delta t sub s.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.860
And now we use the
equation up top here

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.510
to see what the observer
himself would actually measure.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:51.970
And that becomes just 1 over
gamma times delta t sub prime.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:59.720
So delta t sub observed is
equal to 1 over gamma times 1

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:07.650
minus v over c inverse
times delta t sub source.

00:51:11.514 --> 00:51:13.680
And now since it's important
we get the same answer,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.820
I'm going to write in
some intermediate algebra

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.730
here just so we can all
really see that it works out.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:26.390
The 1 over gamma, I am going
to write as-- remember gamma is

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.270
1 over the square root
of 1 minus beta squared--

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:32.770
so 1 over gamma is the square
root of 1 minus beta squared.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:36.640
And I'm going to write that
as the square root of 1

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.240
plus beta times 1 minus beta.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.060
So this is the
factor 1 over gamma.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:50.600
Now we have explicitly here a
factor of 1 over 1 minus beta.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.952
The inverse makes it 1 over.

00:51:52.952 --> 00:51:55.825
Did I write something wrong?

00:51:55.825 --> 00:51:57.783
AUDIENCE: From the second
until the third time?

00:52:00.472 --> 00:52:02.180
PROFESSOR: Second to
third, you're there?

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.090
AUDIENCE: I thought it wasn't--

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:04.965
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
goes to the other side.

00:52:04.965 --> 00:52:05.740
It is minus.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.480
OK, finally, the 1
minus beta, you see

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.020
occurs to the first
power in the denominator.

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:19.250
And the 1/2 power
to the numerator.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.980
So we do indeed get
exactly what we wanted.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.920
Delta t sub 0 is equal
to the square root of 1

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:42.900
plus beta divided by 1 minus
beta times delta t sub s.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:54.450
And now we know that this
is the relativistic answer

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.525
for either source
or observer moving.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:18.320
And then if we want to
write down what z is,

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:25.670
this is delta t observer divided
by delta t source minus 1.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:29.630
So that becomes just
the square root of 1

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:36.840
plus beta over 1
minus beta minus 1.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.820
So we found what
we expected, what

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.670
we wanted to find to be
consistent with the basic ideas

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:14.380
of relativity.

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.880
It's the same answer
no matter which

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.720
one is moving, because
it doesn't matter

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:21.380
what frame of reference
we do the calculation in.

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:24.270
OK, questions about either
the calculations or the ideas

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.780
behind them?

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.260
OK in that case, let's move on.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.470
I do want to come back and
talk about the other two

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:46.100
kinematic effects of
special relativity, which

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.290
are Lorentz contraction
and a change

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.205
in the notion of simultaneity.

00:54:51.205 --> 00:54:52.730
But before I get
to that, there's

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.120
one other issue I
want to discuss first,

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.600
mainly because it's something
you need to understand

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.900
to do the problem set
that's due tomorrow.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:04.730
And that is the
situation that's needed

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:08.570
to describe clocks which
might be accelerating.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.810
Special relativity really only
describes inertial reference

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.510
frames and how things change
from one inertial frame

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.460
to another.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:19.270
So if you know how
a clock behaves

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.560
if it's at rest in
one reference frame,

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.706
special relativity completely
dictates without any ambiguity

00:55:25.706 --> 00:55:27.330
what it would look
like at a frame that

00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:30.310
was moving at a
uniform velocity,

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:33.490
relative to the original frame,
which means it completely

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:37.860
dictates how that clock is
going to behave if it is moving

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:41.270
at a constant uniform velocity.

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:43.430
But nonetheless,
in the real world,

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:48.650
we have very few clocks around
that are completely inertial.

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.075
Every clock that
we see around us

00:55:50.075 --> 00:55:51.450
from the clock on
the wall, which

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.940
is moving with the earth or my
wrist watch which moves more,

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:58.040
is constantly undergoing
accelerations.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.400
So we want to be able
to talk about clocks

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.770
which are accelerating.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.480
So we need to say a little
bit about how we would do that

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.510
and how we do it if the clocks
were moving at relativistic

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:12.700
speeds , which also happens
with satellites, for example.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.690
The GPS system as you've
probably been told

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.470
wouldn't actually work
unless the calculations were

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.010
done in such a sophisticated
way that they even

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.740
take into account the
effects of general relativity

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.500
as well special relativity.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.610
So moving clocks
and how they behave

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:31.480
is a crucially important
topic technologically.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.910
So what do we say that a
clock that's accelerating?

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.620
There's I think a common myth
that to describe acceleration

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:43.259
you need general
relativity, and therefore we

00:56:43.259 --> 00:56:45.300
have to put off talking
about accelerating clocks

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.640
until we take a course
in general relativity.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.350
That's actually totally false.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:54.640
What general relativity does
is provide a theory of gravity

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.170
which basically says the gravity
and acceleration are intimately

00:56:58.170 --> 00:56:59.730
linked.

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:03.000
And that's where
acceleration gets

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.970
pushed into general relativity.

00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:08.340
But special relativity
alone is enough for us

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:11.320
to describe any system that
could be described by equations

00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.950
that are consistent
with special relativity.

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:16.980
Special relativity does
not describe gravity.

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.560
So in any situation where
gravity is important,

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:22.800
special relativity is at a
loss to make real predictions

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.840
about what should happen.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.200
But as long as gravity is
absent, as long as we're only

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.310
dealing with
electromagnetic forces

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:33.440
that we think we
understand, there's

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.060
nothing that prevents
us from using

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:37.800
the equations of
special relativity

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.170
to describe what happens.

00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:41.840
We have to use the dynamical
equations of special relativity

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.490
that talk about how
things respond to forces.

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.740
And whenever there's a force,
there's an acceleration.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.640
But there really
are such equations.

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.800
We can combine, for
example, electromagnetism

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.920
with relativistic mechanics to
describe a system of particles

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.480
that are interacting
electromagnetically, completely

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.530
consistent with
special relativity.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:03.280
And even those particles
are accelerating,

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.930
we could say everything
we want to say about them.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:08.572
So in particular, if
there's a physical clock,

00:58:08.572 --> 00:58:11.030
to the extent that we could
describe that clock as made out

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:14.290
of particles whose
physics we understand,

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.860
special relatively
will still tell us

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:19.970
what that clock will do even
when that clock accelerates.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:23.820
The answer, however, from that
calculation, you might imagine,

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:24.970
is very, very complicated.

00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:28.210
Because the physics
of any actual clock,

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:31.484
my wrist watch as an example,
is pretty damn complicated.

00:58:31.484 --> 00:58:33.150
And we're not really
going to write down

00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:36.510
the equations that describe
my wrist watch to figure out

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.630
how it's going to behave
when it accelerates.

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.890
So what are we going to do?

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.770
Let me point out
that you already

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:46.354
have pretty much experience
with accelerating clocks,

00:58:46.354 --> 00:58:48.020
because all of you--
well, many of you--

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.500
wear wrist watches like I
do that are accelerating

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.890
all the time.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:52.870
And they tend to work.

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.530
You basically assume that even
though they're accelerating

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:58.250
they've been designed well
enough so they can withstand

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:01.510
the accelerations that
your wrist gives them

00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:04.060
and still read the right time.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.050
On the other hand, one could
imagine contrary situations.

00:59:10.909 --> 00:59:12.700
Probably my wrist watch
would survive this,

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.130
but if you take a mechanical
clock, a windup clock,

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:19.060
and heave it against
the wall and let

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:21.320
it smash against the
wall and come to a stop,

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:22.810
as it smashes
against the wall, it

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.304
wanted to go a very
large acceleration.

00:59:25.304 --> 00:59:26.970
And if the acceleration
is large enough,

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:30.090
we can predict the effect
it will have the clock, even

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:32.391
though it's a
complicated interaction.

00:59:32.391 --> 00:59:33.890
If the acceleration
is large enough,

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.740
it'll simply break the
clock and it will stop.

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.040
And that's one possible
effect that acceleration

00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.920
can have a clock.

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.530
And other effects are
similar in nature.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:47.240
If there's any effect
that the motion of my hand

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.532
has on the wrist watch, it
would be a mechanical effect

00:59:49.532 --> 00:59:51.073
that you'd calculate
by understanding

00:59:51.073 --> 00:59:52.680
the mechanics of
how the watch works,

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.300
not by understanding
any principles

00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:56.630
of general relativity.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.250
What's at stake
underlying this--

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.730
you might wonder what
the real difference is--

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:04.610
special relativity can make
precise predictions about how

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.150
a clock will behave if it
moves at a uniform velocity,

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.210
even without knowing
anything about the details

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.145
of that clock.

01:00:12.145 --> 01:00:14.020
Special relativity could
make that prediction

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.750
because there's a symmetry,
Lorentz symmetry, which

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.290
relates those two situations.

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.200
And that's an exact
symmetry of nature.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.580
So no matter what the
clock is made out of,

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.820
if it's moving at
a uniform velocity,

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.320
special relativity
tells you there's

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.490
no doubt it would run
slowly by a factor of gamma.

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:37.360
On the other hand,
there's no such principle

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.080
of any kind, either
in special relativity

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.660
or general relativity,
about acceleration.

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.740
So if you want to know
the effect of acceleration

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:48.000
on a clock, it really depends
in detail on how large

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.280
the acceleration is of
course and the detailed

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.710
physics of the clock and how
much acceleration it takes

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:57.080
to effect it and in what
way it affects, precisely.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.820
So what's the bottom line?

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.620
The bottom line is
that when we want

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.030
to talk about an accelerated
clock, which we really

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:06.290
do all the time, what
we always do is simply

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:08.920
assume that the clock
is built well enough

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.680
so that the acceleration
does not affect its speed.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.520
And that really can be
said very precisely.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.790
The assumption that
we're going to be making

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:20.450
is that these are
ideal clocks, meaning

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.812
that they're built well.

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.520
And when we say the
acceleration does not

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.140
affect the speed of the
clock, what we're saying

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:31.260
is that the clock will run
at precisely the same speed

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:34.650
as another clock that's,
say, moving instantaneously

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.820
alongside it with
the same velocity

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.640
but with no acceleration.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.260
So at any point in the
motion of my arm here,

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.810
my wrist watch will have
some specific velocity.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.960
The velocity will
affect in some tiny way

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.750
the speed of the clock by
this factor gamma, which

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.390
will be very close
to 1 for that case.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:59.380
But we're going to assume, if
we call my watch an ideal clock,

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.820
that in the even time,
it will be running

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.290
at exactly the same speed
as a clock which is not

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.940
accelerating, but
which is moving

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.170
with the same velocity
as the wrist watch.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.410
Therefore, the factor
of gamma will be there,

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:13.024
but there'll be no
effect of acceleration.

01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:14.940
The speed of the clock
will be determined only

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.990
by its velocity relative
to our reference frame.

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.530
OK, is that clear enough?

01:02:23.684 --> 01:02:26.100
And that's what you need to
assume about some accelerating

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.430
clocks that show up
on the problem set.

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.690
That's why I wanted
to get it in today.

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:33.591
OK, if there are no other
questions about that,

01:02:33.591 --> 01:02:35.590
I'd like to come back and
talk a little bit more

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.164
about special relativity
and its consequences.

01:02:40.164 --> 01:02:42.580
Sometime later in the course,
we'll talk a little bit more

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:45.240
about what I would call
the dynamical consequences

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.590
of special relativity,
which include

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:51.970
well known equations like e
equals mc squared, for example.

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:55.090
But before one talks
about energy and momentum,

01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:59.000
which are quantities which
I will dub dynamical,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.470
there kinematic effects
of special relativity

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.460
of which this time
dilation is one.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.250
And by kinematic
I really just mean

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.950
the consequences of
special relativity

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:11.680
for the measurements
of times and distances.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.150
And if one limits oneself
to discussing consequences

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:19.610
for times and distances,
kinematic consequences,

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:22.750
there really are precisely
three and no more consequences

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:24.040
of special relativity.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.520
And really all special
relativity in some sense

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.537
is embodied by these
three statements

01:03:28.537 --> 01:03:30.870
that we're going to be talking
about, the first of which

01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:33.050
was time dilation, which
we've already seen.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.356
I'll just remind you.

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.980
Time dilation says
that any clock which

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.330
is moving at speed d relative
to a given reference frame

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:43.100
will appear in quotation
marks to an observer using

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.619
that reference frame to run
slower than normal by a factor

01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:48.035
denoted by the
Greek letter gamma.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.930
Turn out the board lights
in case they're distracting.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:02.990
And again, "appear" refers
not to how it would actually

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:07.096
look to any particular observer,
because any particular observer

01:04:07.096 --> 01:04:08.470
in a particular
location is going

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:11.201
to be waiting for light
rays to reach that observer.

01:04:11.201 --> 01:04:12.950
And they'll take
different amounts of time

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.170
depending on where they start.

01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:17.630
"Appear" refers to measurements
made in the reference

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:19.770
frame of the observer,
where we assume

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:23.690
that all the actual measurements
are made by on the spot clocks

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:27.090
and rulers who measure
where the object actually

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:29.670
were at the time these
events happened and not

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.760
what it looks like at
sometime later when

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.340
light rays reach some observer.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.370
OK, the second consequence,
and again all these

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:39.661
will involve the word "appear."

01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.500
And I'll always write
it in quotation marks

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:44.420
to remind you that it's not
exactly what a person would

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:45.300
see.

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.450
The second one is another famous
effect of special relativity,

01:04:48.450 --> 01:04:50.440
Lorentz contraction,
or sometimes called

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.420
Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction.

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.220
Any rod which is moving at
a speed v along its length

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.840
relative to a given
reference frame

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.290
will appear-- and again
appear to an observer

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:04.130
using that reference
frame-- to be shorter

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:07.570
than its normal length by
the same factor, gamma.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.060
A rod which is moving
perpendicular to its length

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.470
does not undo that change
in apparent length.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:14.900
So these pictures
kind of show it all.

01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:18.180
A rod, that bar is
the rod, a rod which

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.984
is moving at speed v
will look contracted,

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:26.560
will appear to be contracted,
by a factor of gamma.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.590
And a rod which is
moving perpendicular

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:32.130
to its length, a rod which
is like this moving this way,

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:37.000
has no such effect, we'll appear
to have its natural length.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.670
And this is a very
famous consequence

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.586
of special relativity.

01:05:39.586 --> 01:05:41.630
It means that moving
rocket ships shorter

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:44.311
and shorter and faster
they go, and so on.

01:05:44.311 --> 01:05:45.810
And again, you
should remember, it's

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:46.976
not what you'd actually see.

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:50.490
It's what you'd measure if you
had on the spot local observers

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:54.840
making these measurements,
which you then later compile.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.680
OK, that's actually all I want
to say about the contraction.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:00.410
Any questions?

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:09.040
OK, next and last is an effect
we just talked about less

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.640
because it's a little bit
more intricate to describe.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.700
But the other crucially
important effect-- these

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.560
would not be consistent if
you didn't have all three.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.370
The other crucially
important effect

01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:24.800
is the changing simultaneity,
the relativity of simultaneity.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.730
And it takes more
words describe it,

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:29.429
so there's more words on the
slide than on the other slides.

01:06:29.429 --> 01:06:31.720
And the pictures are a little
bit more complicated too.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.380
But the pictures do
say it all, really.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:40.290
The point is that if you have a
system consisting of two clocks

01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:44.182
which have been synchronized
in their own rest frame--

01:06:44.182 --> 01:06:46.140
they're both at rest with
respect to each other

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:49.140
and they've been synchronized
in their own rest frame--

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.990
and they're connected
by say a rod,

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:55.020
which has some length which
we'll call l sub 0 in the rest

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.600
frame of the two clocks .

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.980
If that whole system
moves relative to us

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:04.260
by speed v along
the length, those

01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:07.090
clocks, even though they were
synchronized in the rest frame,

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.040
would not look
synchronized to us

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.070
but rather would look like
they're out of synchronization.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:15.350
And in particular, it will
look like the trailing clock,

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:18.860
the one on the back of
this combination of clocks,

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.040
will look a little bit
like it reads a little bit

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.250
later in the day
by a factor which

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.490
is beta times l sub 0 times c.

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.380
Beta remember is
v over c. l sub 0

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.110
is the distance
between the clocks

01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:35.230
as measured in the rest
frame of the clocks.

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.670
And c is of course
the speed of light.

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:40.012
On the other hand,
if these two clocks

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.470
were moving in a
direction which is

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.860
perpendicular to the
line that joins them,

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.776
then there's no change
in the synchronization.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.250
Now I should mention that
this really is crucially

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:58.220
important to the consistency
of the whole picture.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.830
And actually showing that
the picture is consistent

01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:05.120
is more than we're going to do.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.500
It's not impossible to do
at this level by any means.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.624
But it's more than we're
going to do in this class,

01:08:09.624 --> 01:08:12.780
since we're not focusing
on special relativity.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.460
But when you hear about
special relativity

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:17.240
and look at these
postulates, you

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.120
might realize that there seems
to be a pretty obvious tension

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.569
between the idea that
moving clocks run slowly

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:28.500
and that all
observers experience

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.284
the same laws of physics.

01:08:30.284 --> 01:08:32.700
Because it means that if you
and I are moving with respect

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.649
to each other, I would
claim that your clock

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.398
was running slowly.

01:08:37.398 --> 01:08:38.939
But at the same
time, you would claim

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:40.314
that my clock was
running slowly.

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:42.260
Because from your
point of view, you're

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.880
at some fixed velocity and
therefore an inertial frame.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.270
And I'm moving relative to you.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:50.200
So as you would describe it,
I would be a moving clock.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.714
And my clock would
be running slowly.

01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:54.380
So I think your clock
is running slowly.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.229
You think my clock
is running slowly.

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:58.270
That seems to contradict.

01:08:58.270 --> 01:08:59.870
What happens if we hold the
clocks next to each other

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.495
and really just watch
how they compare?

01:09:01.495 --> 01:09:02.670
Which one gets ahead?

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:05.054
How can we disagree on that?

01:09:05.054 --> 01:09:07.470
Well of course, we can't hold
the clock next to each other

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.511
and also have them moving
relative to each other.

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:12.950
That's part of how you
get out of this conflict.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:16.170
But let's think in a
little bit more detail

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:17.710
about what we're
really saying when

01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:20.850
I say that your clock
is running slowly.

01:09:20.850 --> 01:09:23.040
Remember, I want to
make all my observations

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.760
not by watching you, because
then there's this time delay

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.979
effect which complicates things.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:29.770
I make all of my
observations by having

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:33.000
a family of local observers
surrounding me all at rest

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.609
relative to me.

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:36.302
And they report back to me.

01:09:36.302 --> 01:09:38.260
And only when I receive
those reports and piece

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.210
them together do I
get the simple picture

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:42.540
of what happened
where when, which

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.859
is the simple picture
that is described

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:49.470
by these "appear" relationships.

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:53.120
So when I say your clock is
running slowly, what I mean

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.590
is that if I have a network
of clocks all at rest relative

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:58.060
to me, and your
clock comes shooting

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:02.700
by, I would measure what time
it reads as it goes past all

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.780
my local clocks.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.170
Rather, they would measure
what time your clock reads

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.920
as it goes past
each local clock.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.840
And then they would
all report back to me.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.230
So if your clock is running
slowly, for example,

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:17.450
let's say by a factor
of two, it would

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:20.420
mean that when you're
clock passes my clock

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:23.690
and my clock reads one
second, your clock would only

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.794
read half a second, because
it's running slowly.

01:10:25.794 --> 01:10:27.210
It hasn't ticked
off as much time.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:31.770
When it passes some later clock
of my sequence of clocks, where

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.410
my clock reads two
seconds, your clock

01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:36.330
will read one second, and so on.

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:39.542
So in that sense, I would say
your clock was running slowly.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:41.500
Now that has to be
consistent with you thinking

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.400
that my clocks are all
running slowly as well.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.250
So if you agree that my
clocks were all synchronized,

01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:52.150
then you would conclude that
my clocks must be running fast.

01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:53.990
Because when your clock
reads a half second,

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:55.050
my clock reads one second.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.424
When your clock
reads one second,

01:10:56.424 --> 01:10:58.114
my clock reads two seconds.

01:10:58.114 --> 01:11:00.030
You would say that my
clocks were reading fast

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:02.444
if we just made that
direct comparison.

01:11:02.444 --> 01:11:04.860
But at the same time, we know
that's not the right answer.

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.210
You should see the
same physics and I see.

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:09.450
If you and I are moving
with respect to each other,

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:12.680
you should see my
clocks running slowly.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.350
So the way out of that is
this question of simultaneity.

01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:19.380
From the point of
view of your clocks

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.410
going past all my
clocks, if you just

01:11:22.410 --> 01:11:24.694
looked at the time on my
clocks as you passed them,

01:11:24.694 --> 01:11:26.110
you would actually
think that they

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:28.640
were running fast
relative to your clock.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.237
But you would also,
however, not think

01:11:30.237 --> 01:11:32.320
of those clocks were
synchronized with each other.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.300
So you don't
determine what speed

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:37.309
they're running by looking
at two different clocks.

01:11:37.309 --> 01:11:39.100
If you want to figure
out whether my clocks

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.590
running fast or slow, you want
to look at one of my clocks

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:44.590
and see how it
changes with time,

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:45.882
not comparing different clocks.

01:11:45.882 --> 01:11:47.506
Because the different
clocks would just

01:11:47.506 --> 01:11:50.020
be out of synchronism with
respect to each other as you

01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:52.300
would see it.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.680
And we're not going to
go through the details.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.070
But if you do look at
my clocks consistently

01:11:58.070 --> 01:12:01.990
using a family of
your clocks that

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:04.440
are stationary
relative to you, just

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.482
as I thought about
a network of clocks

01:12:06.482 --> 01:12:08.690
when I was trying to measure
the speed of your clock,

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:09.898
then everything's consistent.

01:12:09.898 --> 01:12:12.490
You would see all my
clocks running slowly.

01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:14.700
I would see all of your
clocks running slowly.

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.330
And because we disagree
on what's simultaneous,

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.250
there are no contradictions.

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.834
So simultaneity is
absolutely crucial

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:23.250
to get out of what
would otherwise

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:25.670
be a glaring contradiction
in the whole system.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.400
OK, that's about all I
really wanted to say today.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.280
But let me just give
a preview of things

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.446
that we'll talk about later
in the course concerning

01:12:38.446 --> 01:12:40.617
relativity.

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.700
So far I think we've said
all we are going to say,

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:45.324
unless the questions.

01:12:45.324 --> 01:12:46.740
I think we've said
all we're going

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.860
to say about the
kinematic consequences

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:51.260
of special relativity.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:54.070
And we're not going to be trying
to derive them, as I said.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:56.730
If you're interested,
by the way,

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:58.530
the notes recommend
several references,

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:00.860
including the lecture
notes from eight to 86

01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:03.430
from earlier years when
special relativity was

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.916
included as a real topic.

01:13:05.916 --> 01:13:07.790
So certainly if you're
interested in learning

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:09.600
about this and you
haven't already seen it,

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.430
I'm happy to help you.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.180
But otherwise, it will
not be part of this course

01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.460
to discuss how these
three consequences

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:20.740
of special relativity arise
from the basic postulates

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.530
of special relativity.

01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:25.740
But later we will be saying
things that follow further

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.720
along the line by
pursuing the consequences

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.060
of special relativity
for momentum and energy,

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.420
which will be important to us.

01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:38.530
The connection is the
important connection

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:42.330
and simple connection
that energy and momentum

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.110
are only interesting
to us if they're

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:47.380
defined in a way which makes
them conserved quantities.

01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:49.960
That's why energy and momentum
are important in physics.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.250
Because for a closed
system, the total energy

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:54.730
and the total momentum
do not change.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.740
Energy and momentum
can be transferred

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.130
from one part of a
system to another.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:03.830
But energy and momentum cannot
be either made nor destroyed.

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:07.760
Now if we took Newton's
definitions of energy

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:14.700
and momentum, and used
relativistic kinematics, what

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.070
we would find is
that if we looked

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:19.750
at, say, a collision
of two particles,

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:22.910
the Newtonian definitions
of energy and momentum,

01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:25.720
if we took those
seriously, would tell us

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.115
what might happen
in a collision.

01:14:29.115 --> 01:14:30.990
Usually there's an angle
that's undetermined.

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:33.315
But given an angle, it
determines everything else.

01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.490
If we used special
relativity to then describe

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:43.147
what that same collision would
look like in a different frame,

01:14:43.147 --> 01:14:45.480
we would find that these
Newtonian definitions of energy

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.240
and momentum would not be
conserved in the other frame,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.510
if they were conserved
in the first frame.

01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:53.440
The conservation laws
are dependent on what

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.860
reference frame you're using.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:00.500
So what Einstein
amended was slightly

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.950
modified definitions of
energy and momentum, which

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:10.250
are determined by the criterion
that these slightly modified

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.590
definitions of energy
and momentum should,

01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.950
if they are conserved
in one frame

01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:18.140
be also concerned in
any other frame, which

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.710
are related by the relationships
to special relativity.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.040
So that's why it was
essential once one changed

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.180
the kinematics of going
from one frame to another

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:30.440
to also change the definitions
of energy and momentum

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.540
so that the conservation laws
would hold in all frames using

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:38.530
the new transformation equations
to get from frame to frame.

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:40.120
And that's why
later in the course

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.930
we will be introducing a
slightly modified, slightly

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.100
non-Newtonian, definitions
of energy and momentum

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.009
of moving particles.

01:15:49.009 --> 01:15:50.050
OK, that's all for today.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:53.900
I will see folks next Tuesday.
