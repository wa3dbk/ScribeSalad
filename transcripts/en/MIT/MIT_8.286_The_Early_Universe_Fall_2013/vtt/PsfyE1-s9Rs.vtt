00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.054
PROFESSOR: OK, in that
case, let's get going.

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:30.095
Today's lecture will be
mainly on the blackboard.

00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:32.880
I have a few slides
I want to show.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.670
And what we want to talk about
is the inflationary universe

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.170
model.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.390
So I'll start by describing
the mechanism of inflation,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.025
how it happens.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.210
Inflation is based
on the physics

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.380
of scalar fields and gravity.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.470
As I think we've said, in
present day particle theory,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.930
and by present day I mean
not yet string theory,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.230
all particles are
described as fields,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.530
quantum excitations
of the field.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.390
The analogy that most people
are at least qualitatively

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.930
familiar with, is
the photon, which

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290
is a quantum excitation of
the electromagnetic field.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.190
But in fact, to describe
a relativistic theory

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.440
of interacting
particles, the only way

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.520
we really know for
any kind of particle

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.240
is to introduce a field
and describe the particle

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.450
as a quantized
excitation of the field.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.950
So when we talk
about a scalar field,

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850
that's the quantum
representation

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.990
of some kind of a
scale or particle.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530
And scalar in this
case, means spinless,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.270
same in all directions.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210
A scalar field then,
is just a number

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.010
defined at each point in space.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.580
The only scalar field that we've
actually seen in nature so far,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.990
is the Higgs field.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.910
And indeed, inflation
is very much

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.860
modeled on the Higgs field.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.200
Although the field
that drives inflation,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.669
which is by definition,
called the inflation,

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.000
is probably not the Higgs
field of the standard model.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.210
Although recently, actually,
in the past few years,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.900
people have written a
number of papers proposing

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.640
that maybe the Higgs field
of the standard model

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640
could, in fact, be the
field that drives inflation.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.380
So we don't know.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.770
It's an open question.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.660
But in any case, the
field drives inflation

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.010
is some kind of
cousin, at least,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.040
of the Higgs field
of the standard model

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.130
and that has many of
the same properties.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.300
In particular, the
properties of a scalar field

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.280
are pretty much summarized by
its potential energy function.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.230
Energy density is a function
of the value of the field.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.680
And there are two kinds of
potential energy functions

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.690
that I like to talk about.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.420
One is the kind of that is used
in New inflationary models.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:08.070
And potential energy
versus field value.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.360
And it has a plateau with a peak
at someplace, which is usually

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.060
assumed to be phi equals zero
and a potential energy function

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.860
which may or may not be
symmetric about phi equals zero

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.855
but I'll assume it is,
just for simplicity.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.510
And the second type, which
I'd like to talk about,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.280
mainly for comparison--
This is really

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.690
the one that will
be interesting.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.560
But one could also imagine
a potential energy function

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.920
which really has a local
minimum someplace, which

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.160
is not the global minimum.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.850
And I'll draw it with
the local minimum

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.270
at the origin and the
global minima, two of them

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.280
degenerate, elsewhere.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.980
And this, again, is a
graph of mi versus phi.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.080
And the reason I'm
drawing this is partly

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.296
for historical interest.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.415
This was what was used in the
original inflationary model.

00:04:07.415 --> 00:04:08.730
It is my original paper.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.200
It does not work.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.000
But we'll want to talk
about why it does not work.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.070
In both cases we're
interested in a state, which

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:34.250
can be called a false vacuum,
which is a state where

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.670
the scalar field is just
sitting at phi equals zero.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.870
In the case of the second
of these potentials,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.260
phi equals zero being
a local minimum,

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.140
is classically
completely stable.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.540
If one had a scalar field
in some region of space

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.750
just sitting in that
minimum, there'd

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.760
be no place where energy could
come from that would drive it

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.610
out of that minimum
over the barrier.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.040
In the second case, the
field is classically stable.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.260
But it's still possible for it
to quantum mechanically tunnel

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.750
through the barrier.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.100
And that process has been
calculated and understood.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.600
Originally by Sidney
Coleman and collaborators.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.600
And an important feature
of that tunneling

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.550
is that does not
happen globally.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.250
You might think that there
would be some probability that

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.014
suddenly everywhere
in the universe

00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:37.930
the scalar field would
tunnel over the barrier

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.020
and go down to the other side.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.050
The probability of
that is zero, as you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.152
might realize if you
thought about a bit more.

00:05:44.152 --> 00:05:45.610
There's just no
way that the scalar

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.499
field that far
over there is going

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.790
to know the tunnel at the
same time as the scalar field

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.920
far over there.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.010
So the timely happens
locally and it really

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.250
happens in a very
small region, which

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.040
then tunnels over the
barrier and the scalar field

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.870
start rolling down on the other
side in this small region.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.010
And then that region grows.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.650
The scalar field, as it
rolls over the barrier,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.780
pulls the scalar field nearby.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.070
And the region
grows with a speed

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.420
that rapidly approaches
the speed of light.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.640
In the New
inflationary potential,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.070
where we have actually
a local maximum here,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.410
the situation is
classically meta stable,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.330
in the sense that the smallest
possible fluctuation can start

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.700
the field rolling down the hill.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.510
And in particular,
quantum fluctuations

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.550
will, if nothing
else, start the field

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.780
rolling down the hill in
some finite amount of time.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.850
We're interested
in the case where

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.430
the amount of time it takes
for quantum fluctuations

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.370
to push the field off the hill
is relatively long compared

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.610
to time scales involved
in the early universe.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.220
And the key time scale
involved in the early universe

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.896
is the Hubble time.

00:06:59.896 --> 00:07:02.270
And the Hubble time is just
driven by the energy density.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.800
So one can calculate
the Hubble time.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.350
And one is interested
in the case

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.480
for building
inflationary models,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.480
where the top of the hill is
smooth enough, gentle enough,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.950
has a small enough
second derivative

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.220
so that the amount of time it
will take for the scalar field

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.480
to roll off the hill
is long compared

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.160
to the Hubble time
of the universe.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.150
So in both cases,
for short times,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.300
the scalar field is just
stuck at the origin.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.050
And that's what's
important, as far as

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.590
what we want to talk about next.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.150
So the characteristic
of this state

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:47.960
called the false vacuum is
that the scalar field is

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.590
pinned at a high energy state.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.106
Scalar field is pinned
at a high energy density.

00:08:21.106 --> 00:08:26.790
And by pinned, I mean in advance
you just can't change quickly.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.590
In general, particle
physicists use the word vacuum

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.549
to mean the state of lowest
possible energy density.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.760
When we call this
a false vacuum,

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.530
we're really using the word
false in the sense of the word

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.780
temporary.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.880
These states are
temporary vacuums,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.020
in that for some period of time,
which is long by early universe

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.602
standards, the energy
density can't get any lower.

00:08:52.602 --> 00:08:53.810
So it's acting like a vacuum.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.530
Now what are the
consequences of that?

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.870
The important
consequence of that

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.640
is that the pressure has
to be large in negative

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.280
and in fact, equal to the
negative of the energy density.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:18.130
And there are two ways we can
convince ourselves of that.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.920
The first is that if we remember
the cosmological equation

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.426
that we derived somewhere in the
middle of course for row dot.

00:09:25.426 --> 00:09:33.050
We learned that row dot is
equal to minus 3 a dot over a

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.770
where a is the scale
factor times row

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:39.610
plus the pressure
over c squared.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.420
Now what we're saying here, is
that as the universe expands,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.080
the scalar field is just stuck
at this false vacuum value.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.410
The energy density is stuck at
the energy density associated

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.800
with that value of the
field, the potential energy

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.460
density of the field itself.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.330
And therefore, row dot will be
zero as the universe expands.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.120
And if row dot is
zero, we can just

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.050
read off from this equation
what the pressure has to be.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.800
Row dot equals zero implies
that the pressure is just

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.080
equal to minus the energy
density times c squared,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.710
which is another way of
saying it's minus-- Excuse me,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:22.730
the mass density
times c squared,

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.590
which is another way of saying
it's minus the energy density.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.330
I'm using u for energy density
and row for mass density.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.540
And they just differ by
a factor of c squared.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.820
So this is the straightforward
equation method

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.120
of seeing the answer here.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.690
But if you want to explain this
to your roommates or somebody

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.280
who is not taking
this class, there's

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.916
also a simple argument based
on a thought experiment, which

00:10:48.916 --> 00:10:50.290
I think is worth
keeping in mind.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.206
And we've used this
argument before, actually,

00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:54.690
in similar contexts.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:11:02.095
If we imagine a piston chamber
in our thought experiment.

00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:08.600
And in our piston
chamber, we're going

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.215
to put false vacuum
on the inside.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:27.160
And the false vacuum will
have an energy density,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.440
I'll call it u sub f.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.200
And on the outside.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.270
we're going to have
a zero energy vacuum.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.440
Now we've learned
that since 1998, we've

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.510
known that our vacuum is
not a zero energy vacuum.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.410
We seem to be seeing a non-zero
vacuum energy in our universe.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.390
However, even if that's
true, the vacuum energy

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.050
of our universe is
incredibly small

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.660
compared to the false
vacuum energy density

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.020
that we're talking about in
terms of the early universe.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.260
So you could still very
well approximate it as zero

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.950
and not worry about it.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.740
So that's what
we'll be doing here.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.020
So we'll think of
the outside as being

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.110
either a fictitious vacuum,
which by definition, has zero

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.250
energy density and
we can talk about it

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.250
even if it doesn't exist.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.410
Or we could think of it
as being the real vacuum

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.790
in our universe, which has
an energy density which

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.580
is approximately
zero on this scale.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.830
Now what we want to
do is just imagine

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.030
pulling out that piston.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:54.600
So we have now created
an extra region

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.630
on the interior of
the piston chamber.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.920
And we're going to be
assuming that we've somehow

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.730
rigged the walls of the chamber
so that the false vacuum will

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.370
be stretched as we
pull out the piston.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.010
The piston is attached to
the false vacuum in some way.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.440
So this entire area inside
region is now false vacuum.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.260
And therefore, the volume
of the false vacuum region

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.801
has enlarged.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.370
And if we call the
extra region here

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.150
delta v, the volume
of that region,

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:48.200
we now have a situation where
the energy has increased

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.510
by the energy density of the
false vacuum times delta v

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.250
by changing the
volume of the chamber.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:01.770
Now, energy has to be conserved.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.440
So this energy has to be
equal to the work that

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.290
was done by whatever force
pulled out on this piston.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.760
We won't need to specify who
was pulling on the piston,

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:22.440
but the work done when
one pulls out on a piston

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:28.691
is just equal to
minus p times delta v,

00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:31.790
the work done by the person
pulling on the piston.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.550
So the normal case, the
pressure would be positive,

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.780
the piston would be
pushing out on the person

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.040
holding the piston and the
interior would be doing work

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.530
on the person pulling out.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.440
And it would be positive if
the pressure were positive.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.590
The work done on
the person, but this

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:54.340
is supposed to be the
work done on the gas.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:17.920
And that's minus
p times delta v.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.420
So if energy is conserved,
the work done on the gas

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.070
has to be equal to the
change in energy of the gas.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.420
And the change in energy
of the gas is that.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:33.970
So conservation
of energy implies

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:44.100
that delta e equals delta
w or use of f times delta v

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.840
equals minus p times delta
v, which of course implies

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:57.220
that p is equal to minus
use of f, as we said before.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.050
So the point is that if the
energy inside the piston

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.250
is going to increase, the
person pulling out on the piston

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.690
had better be doing work, had
better be doing positive work.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:10.711
And if the pressure
inside were positive,

00:16:10.711 --> 00:16:12.210
the person pulling
out on the piston

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:13.418
would be doing negative work.

00:16:13.418 --> 00:16:16.140
The piston would
be pushing on him.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.740
So for it to make sense
here, with the energy

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:22.810
in the piston increasing,
the person pulling out

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.310
has to really be pulling
against a suction.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.170
He has to do work to pull out.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.900
And a suction means
a negative pressure,

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.670
if we have zero
pressure outside.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.164
Pressure inside
has to be negative.

00:16:35.164 --> 00:16:37.330
So we could reach this
conclusion either of two ways

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.010
and we get the same conclusion.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.260
The pressure is just equal
to minus the energy density.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.035
Yes?

00:16:43.035 --> 00:16:44.935
AUDIENCE: I'm a little
confused about why

00:16:44.935 --> 00:16:46.880
the energy's increasing inside.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.255
Because why couldn't
you just say

00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:50.664
the energy density decreases
with the increased volume?

00:16:50.664 --> 00:16:52.580
PROFESSOR: OK the question
is why couldn't you

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.990
just say that the
energy density would

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.540
decrease with the
increased volume.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.956
That certainly is
what will happen

00:16:56.956 --> 00:16:59.060
if you have normal gas inside.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.110
What makes this particular
false vacuum odd

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.190
is the origin of this
energy density, which

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.030
is the potential energy
density of the field.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.290
So if we were talking
about the situation,

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.619
for example, which
is the clearest cut,

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.260
the only way the energy
density here could go down

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.349
is if the scalar field
goes up over the barrier

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.410
and then comes down over here.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.790
And there's no way to drive
it there, except to wait

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.520
for a quantum fluctuation,
which is a very slow process.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.680
And similarly, here
there's no barrier.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.230
So it can't just roll down.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.410
But that takes a
certain amount of time.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.880
And we're assuming that all the
things we're talking about here

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.400
are happening on
a time that's fast

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.900
compared to the amount of time
it takes for the scalar field

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.410
to roll.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.190
So what makes this peculiar
false vacuum special is that it

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.620
cannot lower its
energy density quickly.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.340
And that's what the word
false vacuum implies.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.676
And there are states like that.

00:17:53.676 --> 00:17:55.050
And then those
states necessarily

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.591
have a negative
pressure, or pressure

00:17:56.591 --> 00:18:02.730
that's equal to good accuracy
to minus the energy density.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.500
Or I say to good accuracy only
because the energy density

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.950
could change a
little bit slowly,

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.010
at least for the top case.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.780
But it's limited how
much it can change.

00:18:15.466 --> 00:18:16.840
OK, now what are
the consequences

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.920
of this cosmologically?

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.400
Well we've also learned that
we could write the second order

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.590
Friedman equation, which is the
equation really tells us what

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.440
the force of gravity is doing.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:37.960
A double dot is equal minus
4 pi over 3 g times row

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.200
plus 3 p over c squared.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.430
Now for the false vacuum,
p is equal to minus row

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.220
c squared minus
the energy density.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.060
And that means that this term is
negative and three times as big

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.650
as that term.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.300
So for the false
vacuum, this quantity,

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.160
which we normally think
of as being positive,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.500
becomes negative.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.760
I should write factor of a here.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.230
And that means that
instead of gravity slowing

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.940
down the expansion the
universe for a false vacuum,

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.980
the expansion is accelerated.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.790
And that's also what
we're seeing today

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.050
with the vacuum
energy, which behaves

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.590
the same way as
this false vacuum

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.340
and produces gravitational
repulsion in exactly

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.080
the same way.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:41.490
So false vacuum implies
gravitational repulsion.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.680
OK, this basically is the
mechanism of inflation.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.900
So we're sort of finished
with this chapter.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.390
Are any questions
before I go on about how

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.496
this gravitational
repulsion arises?

00:20:17.496 --> 00:20:17.995
Michael.

00:20:17.995 --> 00:20:20.994
AUDIENCE: So, for the top vacuum
that you've drawn up there,

00:20:20.994 --> 00:20:23.210
where there's no barrier,
you just roll slowly,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.614
are we assuming that it
takes a long time for it

00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:27.598
to begin to roll or
after it's started

00:20:27.598 --> 00:20:30.078
rolling that it also takes
a very long time to reach

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:31.080
the bottom.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.039
PROFESSOR: I guess I'd
say both, Begin to roll

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:35.080
is not that well defined.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.750
Because it may have it
an infinitesimal velocity

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.980
from the time you
start discussing it.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.480
And then that
infinitesimal velocity

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.004
gets bigger and bigger.

00:20:43.004 --> 00:20:45.670
But I think what we're saying is
that the whole process, however

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.060
you divide it up, it's going
to take a long time compared

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.540
to the time it takes for
the exponential expansion

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.140
to set in.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.420
OK.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:09.040
So now, I'd like to
take this physics

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.410
and just put a
scenario around it.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.760
And we'll call the new
inflationary scenario

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.660
because that's what it is.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.790
Maybe now I should
mention a little bit more

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.950
about the history here.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.660
When I wrote my
original paper, I

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.270
was assuming a
potential of something

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.790
like this, because it seemed
generic and created inflation

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.860
and I was able to understand
that inflation would solve

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.692
a number of cosmological
problems, which

00:21:37.692 --> 00:21:39.400
are the problems that
we've talked about.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.330
And we'll come back
to talk about how

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.510
inflation solves them.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.010
But

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.670
But, one still has
to end inflation.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.530
In this model,
inflation would end only

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.590
by the tunneling
of the scalar field

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.400
through the barrier,
which as I said,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.510
happens in small
regions which then grow.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.970
Those regions are spherical
so they're called bubbles.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.190
And the whole process really is
very much the way water boils.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.970
When you boil water, it forms
very small bundles initially

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.790
and the bundles grow and then
start colliding with each other

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.890
and making a big frothy mess.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:21.520
And it turns out that that's
exactly what would happen

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.790
in the early universe
if you had this model.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.010
When I first started
thinking about it,

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.500
I hoped that these bundles
could collide with each other

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
while they're still
small and merge

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.970
into a uniform, hot region of
the new phase, a phase where

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.430
the scalar field is
not there, but there.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.010
But that turned
out to be the case.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.680
It turned out that the bubble
formation process produced

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.280
horrible inhomogeneities
that there did not

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.270
seem to be anyway to cure.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.810
And that then was
the downfall of

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.920
the original inflationary model.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.590
But a few years later, Andrei
Linde in the Soviet Union,

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:09.560
and independently, Albrecht
and Steinhardt in the US,

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.880
proposed what came to be called
the new inflationary model,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.060
which started with a
different assumption

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.810
about what the underlying
potential energy

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.890
function for the
scalar field was.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.080
Instead of assuming
something like this,

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.559
which might be called
generic in some sense,

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.100
they instead assumed
something that's

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.970
a little bit more special,
a potential energy

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.530
function with a
very flat plateau

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.820
somewhere, which, well, we
normally put in the middle.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:41.690
And this has the advantage,
that the inflation ends, not

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:46.150
by bubbled nucleation by
tunneling, but instead,

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.130
by just small fluctuations
building up and pushing

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.940
the scalar field down the hill.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.550
And what makes it
work, basically

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.900
is that those small fluctuations
have some spatial correlations

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:58.740
built into them.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:03.700
So over some small region, which
I will calla coherence region,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.210
the fluctuations are
essentially uniform.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.430
And the other
important feature is

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.540
that once the scalar
field starts to roll,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.930
it still has some nearly
flat hill to roll on.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.900
So a significant
amount of inflation

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.560
happens after this homogeneous
coherence region forms.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.890
So the initial coherence
region can be microscopic,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.110
but it is then stretched
by the inflation that

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.470
continues as the
scalar field rolls down

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.990
the hill towards the bottom.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.990
So that process of stretching
the coherence region

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:47.150
after it has already formed is
what makes this model workable,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.260
while this model was not.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.000
So that's the basic story of
how new inflation succeeded

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.990
in allowing inflation
to end gracefully,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.910
is the phrase that was used.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.830
The problems associated
with this model

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.310
came to be called the
graceful exit problem.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.170
And this is the first solution
to the graceful exit problem.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.380
They're now other solutions.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.796
But they're very
similar actually.

00:25:23.052 --> 00:25:24.510
So I'll just write
here that's it's

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:54.010
a modification of the
original inflationary model

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.335
to solve this graceful
exit problem problem.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.095
Now I should say a little bit
about how inflation starts.

00:26:06.654 --> 00:26:08.320
But I can only say a
little bit about it

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.795
because the bottom line
really is we don't know.

00:26:11.795 --> 00:26:15.320
We still don't have any real
theory of initial conditions

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.950
for cosmology, whether
it's inflationary cosmology

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.850
or any kind of cosmology.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.600
The nice feature of
inflation is that it

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.912
allows a significantly broader
set of initial conditions

00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:30.370
than is required, for example,
in the standard cosmological

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:34.220
model, where, as we discussed,
the needed initial conditions

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.530
are very precisely specified.

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:40.480
I might say a few things though,
about ideas people have had.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.280
One idea, which I think
sounds very reasonable,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.810
is due to Andrei Linde.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.492
And it's a vague
idea, so it really

00:26:55.492 --> 00:26:57.450
needs to be more precise
before it could really

00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.408
be considered a theory.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.630
But this is just the idea
that the universe started out

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.150
with some kind of chaotic
random initial conditions.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.580
And then the hope is simply that
inflation will start somewhere.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.620
That somewhere in the initial
chaotic distribution there'll

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.430
be a place where the
scalar field will

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.130
have the right properties,
the right configuration

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.680
to initiate inflation.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.130
There are also
models by Vilenkin,

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.849
Alex Vilenkin of Tufts, and
independently, Andrei Linde,

00:27:41.849 --> 00:27:43.140
who by the way, is at Stanford.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.920
They both worked on
models where the universe

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.760
could begin by a quantum
tunneling process,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.330
starting from
absolutely nothing.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.690
I wrote here absolutely
nothing and that's

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.590
more nothing than nothing.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.599
You might think of nothing
as just empty space.

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:29.640
But from the point of view
of general relativity,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.080
as you already know
enough to understand,

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.080
empty space is not
really nothing.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.470
Empty space is really
a dynamical system.

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.640
Empty space can bend and
twist and stretch and do

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.420
all kinds of complicated things.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.700
It's really no different,
in some basic sense,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.420
from a big piece of rubber.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.100
So nothingness
really is intended

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.920
to mean a state where there's
not only no matter present,

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.150
but also no space and
no time, really nothing.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.550
One way to think
of it, perhaps, is

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.770
as a closed universe, the
limit as the size of the closed

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.785
universe goes to zero so
that there's nothing left.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.690
None of these
theories are precise.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.700
We don't really know how to
precisely formulate them.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.560
In this tunneling
from nothing, one

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.644
is talking about tunneling
in the context where

00:29:22.644 --> 00:29:25.060
the structure of space itself
changes during the tunneling

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.010
process.

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.710
So it's tunneling in the
context of general relativity.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.750
And we don't really have
a successful quantum

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.040
theory of general relativity.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.780
So these ideas are very
speculative and quite vague.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.540
But they do indicate
some possibilities

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.600
for how the universe
might have started.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.610
An idea closely related to
this tunneling from nothing

00:29:46.610 --> 00:30:08.270
is the Hartle and Hawking--
This is Jim Hartle, of UC Santa

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.370
Barbara, who's also the
author of a general relativity

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:12.790
textbook now.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.870
And Stephen Hawking,
who you must

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.326
know from Cambridge University.

00:30:18.326 --> 00:30:19.950
They proposed something
called the wave

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:20.991
function of the universe.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:36.890
From their point of view,
it's self contradictory

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.610
to talk about the
universe having an origin

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.860
because before the origin of
the universe, space and time

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.137
we're not even defined.

00:30:44.137 --> 00:30:46.470
And therefore, you could not
think of there being a time

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.560
before the universe was created.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.270
And therefore universe
didn't actually get created.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:55.460
It just is and has some
earliest possible time.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.400
And that's what this wave
function of the universe

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.979
formalism reflects.

00:30:59.979 --> 00:31:01.770
But otherwise, it's
pretty similar, really,

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.740
to the idea of
tunneling from nothing.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.170
The idea is that the universe
had some kind of a quantum

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:11.030
origin, which determined the
initial state of the universe.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:18.570
In any case, for the purpose
of inflation, what we really

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.120
need to assume, and this could
be an assumption which follows

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:30.330
from any of these
theories, we need

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:40.260
to assume that the
early universe contained

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:47.440
at least a patch, and
we don't know exactly

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.800
know how big the patch
has to be, but greater

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.930
than or about equal to the
inverse Hubble constant times

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.820
the speed of light,
the Hubble length.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.460
And this initial patch
also has to be expanding,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.870
or else it would just collapse.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.439
It really has to
be expanding faster

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:19.480
than a certain threshold.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.280
But I won't try to put that
all into the one sentence.

00:32:28.342 --> 00:32:29.800
Oh, I didn't say
patch of what yet.

00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:36.880
Whoops.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.072
That's where the average
value of phi is about zero.

00:32:46.072 --> 00:32:48.460
And by average, I mean averaging
over rapid fluctuations,

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.560
if there are any.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.820
And if one has this, no
matter where one got it from,

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.830
inflation will begin.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.810
And once inflation
begins, it doesn't

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:05.280
matter much how it begins.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.870
To see what happens next, it's
easiest to at least pretend,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.760
that to a good
approximation, you

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.740
can treat a small
region of this patch

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.990
as if it were
homogeneous and behaving

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:48.630
like a Robertson-Walker universe
of the type we know about.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.577
Then we can write the first
order Friedman equation,

00:33:52.577 --> 00:33:54.160
which is a little
bit more informative

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.370
than the second order one.

00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:03.270
I'm going to leave out
the curvature term.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.650
We'll argue later that the
curvature term becomes small

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.160
quickly.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.977
But for our first
pass, we'll just

00:34:08.977 --> 00:34:11.060
assume that the universe
is described by something

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.860
as simple as the
Friedman Robertson-Walker

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.090
equation for a flat universe.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.542
For row, we're just
going to put row sub f.

00:34:22.542 --> 00:34:24.000
We'll assume that
our space is just

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.920
dominated by this false
vacuum energy density.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.520
And this can easily be solved.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.219
It just says that the
first derivative divided

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.830
by the function
itself is a constant.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.840
Just take the square
root of this equation.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.179
And that is an equation
which just immediately get

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:45.210
solved and gives
you an exponential.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:53.190
So you find that for late
times, you just get a of t

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:59.490
behaving as a constant times
an exponential of time where

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.500
the exponential time constant,
which I'm calling chi.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.980
Chi is just the square
root of this coefficient.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:14.290
The square root of 8 pi
g over 3 times row sub f.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.710
So clearly this is the
solution to that equation.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.500
And for late times, it is the
solution that will dominate.

00:35:29.615 --> 00:35:30.990
Actually it is
the only solution,

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.130
the way I've already
simplified this.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:34.670
But if we started with the
full system of equations,

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:38.455
there'd be other solutions with
different initial conditions.

00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:39.830
But this is always
what you would

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.540
be led to, for late times.

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:46.366
The exponential
expansion would dominate.

00:35:46.366 --> 00:35:47.990
So that's what
innovation basically is.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.630
It's a period of
exponential expansion.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:01.370
There are a few
features of inflation,

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:08.630
which helps to understand
why it is so robust.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.860
That is, why no
matter how it starts,

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.060
it leads to the same result.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.190
So one feature of inflation
I'd like to mention

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:28.135
is the cosmological no-hair.

00:36:28.135 --> 00:36:30.010
Some people call it a
theorum and some people

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.884
call it a conjecture.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.390
I think the more precise
statement about this theorem

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.530
is that you can prove it as
a theorem perturbatively.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:44.790
That is, if all initial
deviations are small,

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.070
you can really
prove it, but people

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.450
think it's true, even
beyond perturbation theory.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.280
And in that case
it's a conjecture.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:37:04.330
But it's basically the statement
that if one has a system with p

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:13.680
equals minus row c squared
and row is greater than zero,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.430
if that describes the
matter, then essentially

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.160
any metric that you
start with will evolve

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.405
into this exponentially
expanding flat metric.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.850
Any system will evolve
to locally resemble

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.690
a flat exponentially
expanding space time.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.980
And the word locally there
is needed to make it true.

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.520
If, for example, you start
with a closed universe, as just

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.770
a simple example, which has
this kind of matter filling it.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.547
It will start to
grow exponentially.

00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:37.130
It will always stay
a closed universe.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.960
It will never become
literally flat.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.120
But as it gets bigger and
bigger, any piece of it

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.610
will look flatter and flatter.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.151
And it will keep getting bigger
and bigger exponentially fast

00:38:45.151 --> 00:38:45.920
forever.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.570
So it will rapidly
approach a space

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:50.470
which looks like an
exponentially expanding

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.970
flat space.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:54.970
Now this exponentially
expanding flat space time

00:38:54.970 --> 00:39:06.810
has a name, which is
de Sitter space, named

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:09.736
after a Dutch astronomer.

00:39:09.736 --> 00:39:11.814
It was discovered
early on in the history

00:39:11.814 --> 00:39:12.730
of general relativity.

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.750
1917, I think, was the date
that de Sitter wrote his paper

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.764
about de Sitter space.

00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:20.430
It has some very
interesting properties,

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:24.040
which De Sitter do not
notice all of them.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:29.970
In spite of the fact
that I'm describing it

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.380
as a flat exponentially
expanding space time,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.500
that's not the only
possible description.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.840
It turns out that
the same space time,

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.400
by changing what you
call equal time services,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.100
can be described as
either an open or closed

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.740
Robertson-Walker universe,
completely homogeneous

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.970
in both cases.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.600
So it's very weird.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.770
But the easy way to think
of it for most purposes,

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:57.060
is as this flat exponentially
expanding picture.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:05.339
OK Next thing I want to point
out about de Sitter spaces is

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:07.255
that they have what are
called event horizons.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.980
Now early in the course
we talked about horizons

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.040
and didn't really try
to quantify the name.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.150
The horizons that we
used to talk about

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.884
are technically called
particle horizons.

00:40:35.884 --> 00:40:37.300
Those are horizons
that have to do

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.350
with the past history
of the universe

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.930
and are related to the fact
that since the universe has

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:46.380
only a finite past history,
or as a cosmological model

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.425
at least, there's a finite
distance that light could

00:40:49.425 --> 00:40:51.350
have traveled up
until this time.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:54.980
And we cannot have any way of
seeing anything that's further

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.650
away than that maximum distance
that light could have traveled.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.600
That's the particle horizon.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.430
These event horizons
are different.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.680
They're related really, to
the future of the universe,

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.200
rather than the past.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.450
It's a statement that,
because of the fact

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.250
that these universes are
exponentially expanding,

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:16.620
if two events that happen
at a particular time

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.080
are separated from each other
by more than a certain distance,

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.650
then the light
from one will never

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.270
reach the future
evolution of the other.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:33.720
And one can see that by
looking at the total coordinate

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.780
distance that light could
travel between any two times.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.650
So I going to let
delta r of t1 t2

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:52.890
be equal to the
coordinate distance

00:41:52.890 --> 00:42:04.990
that light travels
from t1 to t2.

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:06.850
And I'm going to
assume that a of t

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:08.700
is given by exactly
this formula.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.385
And I'll write out
const because I

00:42:10.385 --> 00:42:12.700
don't want to write
it too many times.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:17.860
I could give it a one variable
symbol if I wanted to.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:23.646
This delta r of t1 t2
is just the integration

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:27.090
of the coordinate
velocity of light

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:34.650
from t1 to t2 of c
divided by a of t dt.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:37.610
The coordinate velocity of light
is just c divided by a of t.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.430
We've seen that formula before.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:46.780
And this can easily be done
by putting in what a of t is.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:50.050
And we get c over
the constant that

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.510
appeared in that
formula, whatever

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:56.010
it is, times chi, the
exponential expansion

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:05.990
rate, times e to the minus chi t
1 minus e to the minus chi t 2.

00:43:14.197 --> 00:43:16.280
And now, the question we
want to ask ourselves is,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.180
suppose we let this
light ray travel

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.590
for an arbitrarily long
amount of time, which

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.700
means taking t2 to infinity.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:29.890
And the important feature
of this expression

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.610
is that as t2 goes to
infinity, the expression

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.510
approaches a finite value.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.890
The second term just disappears.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:40.700
And you're left
with the first term.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.380
So no matter how long
you wait, anything

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.740
that started out with a
coordinate separation larger

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:50.216
than that value, that
asymptotic value,

00:43:50.216 --> 00:43:52.090
will just never be
reached by the light pulse

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.590
that you've sent.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.240
And that's what this
event horizon is.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.450
And it's easy to
see what it actually

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.550
amounts to numerically.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.220
If you want to know how far
away the object has to be now,

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.890
in physical terms, so that its
coordinate distance is larger

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:12.375
than the maximum we get
here, we know how to do that.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:19.740
The maximum value can be
written as just the limit as t2

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:25.945
goes to infinity
of delta of r1 r2.

00:44:25.945 --> 00:44:27.820
And we have the expression
for it right here.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.120
It's just the first
piece of this answer.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.050
And this is the
coordinate distance.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.160
If we want to know the present
physical distance of something

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.220
which is at that
coordinate distance,

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.800
we would just multiply it
by the present scale factor.

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:48.610
And present here means, t1
and t2 are the arguments here,

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:53.160
and we just want to multiply
by a of t1 to get the physical

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.576
distance of an object
which is at this boundary,

00:44:56.576 --> 00:44:58.950
the boundary of what we'll be
able to receive a light ray

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.000
from and what we won't.

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:13.530
So this is the event horizon
distance, physical distance,

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:21.410
and it's just equal to
c times chi inverse.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.280
When you multiply
by a of t1, you

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.285
cancel the constant
of the denominator

00:45:25.285 --> 00:45:26.800
and you cancel the
e minus chi t1.

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.550
And you're just left
with c times chi inverse.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.717
Which is the Hubble length.

00:45:33.717 --> 00:45:35.300
It's the inverse
Hubble constant times

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.110
the speed of light, which
is the Hubble length.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.990
So anything that is further away
one Hubble length, from us now,

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:48.530
if that object emits a light
ray, we will never receive it.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.800
And that's called
the event horizon.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:55.010
Now the reason this is
important is nothing travels

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.640
faster than light.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:59.410
And that means that
in a de Sitter space,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:03.610
everything is limited in
how far it can ever get.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.780
And an important
implication of that

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:10.220
is that if, in our full space,
which may not be entirely

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:14.530
de Sitter space, if we
have a de Sitter region,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.640
but junk outside that,
which we don't understand,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.800
don't know how to predict,
could be anything,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.860
we would still know, even
without knowing what's outside,

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.760
that whatever's
outside can never

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.950
penetrate into the
de Sitter region

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:32.340
by more than one event horizon,
by more than one Hubble length.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.090
So the interior of
the de Sitter region

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.200
is protected from
anything on the outside.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.970
And that is a rigorous
theorem of general relativity,

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:42.077
this protection.

00:46:42.077 --> 00:46:44.410
And that means that once you
have a sizable region of de

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.800
Sitter space, no matter
what's going on outside,

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.890
it's never going to disappear.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:52.170
It will always be protected
by this event horizon.

00:47:42.864 --> 00:47:44.280
I should give you
now a few sample

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:45.993
numbers associated
with this scenario.

00:47:53.279 --> 00:47:55.070
And here I have to say
that we don't really

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.990
know very accurately what are
the right numbers to give here.

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:04.090
So I think the word sample
numbers was well chosen there.

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:06.510
What we don't know is what
energy scale inflation actually

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.640
happened at in the
history of universe.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.890
Turns out that the
consequences are pretty much

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.380
identical for most questions,
or all the questions

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.450
that they have been able so far
to investigate observationally,

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:23.050
regardless of what energy
scale inflation happened.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.160
Inflation was
originally invented

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.450
in the context of
Grand Unified Theories.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:30.320
And I think that's still
a very plausible context

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.950
in which inflation
might have happened.

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.449
And the sample
numbers I'll give you

00:48:33.449 --> 00:48:36.085
will be numbers associated
with Grand Unified Theories.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.950
And what starts the whole
story is the energy scale

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.510
of Grand Unified Theories,
which is about 10

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:59.680
to the 16 GeV billion
electron volts.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.950
And this number is arrived at by
measuring, at accessible energy

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:08.590
with accelerators,
the interaction

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.890
strengths of the three
fundamental interactions

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.410
of the standard model
of particle physics.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.030
The standard model
of particle physics

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:19.390
is based on three different
gauge groups, su 3, su 2

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.174
and u1.

00:49:21.174 --> 00:49:22.590
Each one of those
gauge groups has

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:26.119
associated with it an
interaction strength.

00:49:26.119 --> 00:49:27.160
And they can be measured.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.240
And that's where we
start this discussion.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.010
Then once you measure them
at accessible energies, which

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.490
is like 100 GeV, or
something like that,

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.050
then you can
theoretically extrapolate

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.780
to much higher energies.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:47.860
And what is found is
that to good accuracy,

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.112
the three actually
meet at one point.

00:49:52.112 --> 00:49:53.820
And that is the
underlying basis, really,

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.660
of Grand Unified Theories.

00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:58.030
That's what allows the
possibility that all three

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:02.050
interactions are really just a
manifestation of one underlying

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:07.160
interaction, where the one
underlying interaction is made

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:10.490
to look like three
interactions at lower energies

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.550
through this process
called spontaneous symmetry

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:15.700
breaking, which was talked about
a little bit in a lecture I

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.880
gave the time before
last, I think, in,

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:21.160
probably in Scott's lecture.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.930
Now this meeting
of the three lines

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:28.010
is decent in the context
of what is literally

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.800
the standard model
of particle physics.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:34.240
But if one modifies the standard
model of particle physics

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.450
by incorporating supersymmetry,
a symmetry between fermions

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:41.510
and bosons, and that involves
adding a lot of extra particles

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.860
because none of the
particles that we know of

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.930
make up a fermion boson pair.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:48.890
So in a supersymmetric model
for every known particle,

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.030
you introduce a new
unknown particle.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:54.930
Which would be it's
supersymmetric partner.

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.440
In that minimal
supersymmetric extension

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.000
of the standard model,
the meeting of the lines

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.290
works much better.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:07.200
So it's a piece of evidence
in favor of supersymmetry.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.460
In any case, where
the lines meet

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.370
to good approximation in either
one of these two discussions,

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:18.360
whether it's supersymmetric or
not, is it about 10 to 16 GeV.

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.380
So that becomes the
fundamental math scale

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.515
of the end unified theories.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.020
Hold on a second.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.156
That' what I'm looking for.

00:51:37.156 --> 00:51:38.530
Now once one has
this mass scale,

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:42.680
one can figure out an
appropriate mass density.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.596
And that's what we're
really interested in,

00:51:44.596 --> 00:51:45.970
what would be an
appropriate mass

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:49.520
density for a false vacuum
in a grand unified theory.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.120
And one can develop
that, and we really

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.560
don't know how to do any better.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.476
Because as I've told
you, we don't know really

00:51:55.476 --> 00:51:57.740
know how to calculate
vacuum energies anyway.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:01.197
But as a dimensional
analysis answer,

00:52:01.197 --> 00:52:03.780
we can get the answer because
it is really uniquely determined

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.995
by dimensional
analysis up to factors.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:12.520
If one wants to make an
energy density out of E gut

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.330
plus constants of
physics, the only way

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.510
to do that is to take E
gut to the fourth power

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:25.280
and divide it by h bar
cubed c to the fifth.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.840
And you can convince
yourself at home

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.610
that that gives you
an energy density.

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.680
And you could even evaluate it
numerically, by mass density,

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.870
excuse me.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:41.280
And this is about
equal to 2.3 times 10

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:46.050
to the 81 grams per
centimeter cubed.

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:48.350
So it's a fantastically
high mass density,

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.690
10 to the 81 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:10.060
And if one puts this
into the formula for chi,

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:26.640
the exponential
expansion rate, chi

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:33.890
turns out to be about 2.8 times
10 to the minus 38 seconds.

00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:43.200
And c times chi inverse,
the Hubble length,

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.520
it turns out to be about 8 times
10 to the minus 28 centimeters.

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.069
So all these numbers, off
scale by human standards.

00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:58.610
And that's just a
feature of the fact

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.530
the Grand Unified Theories are
off scale by human standards.

00:54:13.107 --> 00:54:16.516
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:18.790
PROFESSOR: Do I
have this backwards?

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:20.270
No, this is incredibly small.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.888
This is 10 to the minus 28.

00:54:21.888 --> 00:54:23.855
AUDIENCE: So then
it's chi [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:23.855 --> 00:54:24.730
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:26.740
Hold on.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.192
Yeah, no this--

00:54:28.192 --> 00:54:29.650
AUDIENCE: Chi should
be [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.024
PROFESSOR: Chi
inverse is a time.

00:54:31.024 --> 00:54:32.900
C times the time is a distance.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.574
So I think that's right.

00:54:34.574 --> 00:54:36.615
AUDIENCE: So is chi inverse
10 to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if we're in
cgs units, Chi inverse by itself

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.300
would differ by a
factor of 10 to the 10.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:57.601
So it would be 10
to the minus 38, Hm.

00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:58.100
Hold on.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.736
This must be chi inverse.

00:54:59.736 --> 00:55:01.085
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:55:01.085 --> 00:55:02.835
PROFESSOR: There is
an inconsistency here.

00:55:02.835 --> 00:55:03.840
You are right.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.520
Yes, that's chi inverse.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.061
This is time.

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:15.220
And then this just
multiplies by c.

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:17.920
OK so the way this
scenario would work is,

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.480
we would start with the early
universe with some patch

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:24.610
or order of magnitude this size.

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:26.760
Which I might point out
is 14 orders of magnitude

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.970
smaller than the size of
a single proton, which

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.970
would be about 10 to the
minus 13 centimeters.

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:35.060
So 15 orders of
magnitude, maybe.

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:38.110
And then we would
need enough inflation,

00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:49.460
so that at the end of
inflation, the patch should

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:56.386
be on the order of maybe one
to 10 centimaters or more

00:55:56.386 --> 00:56:01.450
It has to be at least about this
big, but could be much bigger.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:04.177
There's no problem with
the being much bigger.

00:56:04.177 --> 00:56:06.260
Much bigger would just
mean there's more inflation

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.730
than you minimally needed.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.630
There's no problem with
having too much inflation.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.020
And then it's a
matter of checking

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:22.200
and a calculation, which
I'll tell you the answer of.

00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.340
If we want to go from some
size of the end of inflation

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.760
to the present universe--
And that's really what

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:32.510
we're interested in, ultimately,
getting the present universe.

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:36.710
--there'd be a further
coasting expansion

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:39.140
from the end of
inflation until now,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:43.740
which can just be calculated
by using the idea that a times

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.130
temperature, scale factor times
temperature, is a constant.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:49.130
So the increase in
the scale factor

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:54.420
is proportional to decrease
in the temperature.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:57.890
And the reheat temperature
of this model--

00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:59.640
Maybe I didn't describe
reheating exactly,

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.910
I'll describe it
quickly in words.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:05.510
At the end of inflation,
the scalar field

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.980
is destabilized by
these fluctuations

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:12.060
and rolls down the hill, then
oscillates about the bottom.

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:14.450
And when it oscillates
about the bottom,

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:17.630
we need to take into account the
fact that this field interacts

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:19.710
with other fields.

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.590
And it then gives its energy
to the other fields, basically

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.170
the standard model
fields ultimately,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:28.790
heating them up, producing
the hot soup of particles

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:31.610
that we think of as the starting
point for the conventional Big

00:57:31.610 --> 00:57:33.000
Bang Theory.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.580
So this reheating
process at the end

00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:38.750
of inflation as
the inflaton field

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:43.770
oscillates about its minimum,
reproduces the starting point

00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:46.587
of the conventional
Big Bang Theory.

00:57:46.587 --> 00:57:48.045
And it produces a
temperature which

00:57:48.045 --> 00:57:50.253
is comparable to the
temperature that you started at,

00:57:50.253 --> 00:57:53.040
which is the temperature
scale of the theory.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.410
So if it's Grand
Unified Theory scales,

00:57:55.410 --> 00:58:00.120
we would reheat to a temperature
of order 10 to the 16 GeV.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.570
And then, to ask what will
be the expansion factor

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:08.370
between then and now, it would
be 10 to the 16 GeV times

00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.922
the Boltzmann constant
times 2.7 Kelvin.

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:14.630
This is the ratio of
the temperature then

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:18.716
to the temperature now,
both expressed as energies.

00:58:18.716 --> 00:58:20.340
And then we might
want to multiply this

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:24.262
by 10 centimeters, if we say
that at the end of inflation,

00:58:24.262 --> 00:58:26.160
the universe was 10
centimeters across.

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.003
Size at end of inflation.

00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.810
This, I worked out at
home, is about 450 times 10

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.280
to the 9th light years.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.950
And we would want
something like 40 times 10

00:58:57.950 --> 00:59:01.406
to the 9th light years to
explain the present universe.

00:59:01.406 --> 00:59:03.820
So this is about
10 times too big.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.320
And that's OK.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.689
It means that we could
get by with one centimeter

00:59:09.689 --> 00:59:11.480
and 10 centimeters is
being a bit generous.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.240
So inflations would start
with this tiny patch.

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.160
At the end of
inflation the patch

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.150
would have grown
to one or maybe 10

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.300
or perhaps more,
centimeters in length.

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:28.820
And then by coasting
up to today it

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.560
becomes something that's
larger than the region

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.240
that we now observe.

00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.420
And that's basically
how the scenario works.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.525
Any questions about those
numbers or the general pattern

00:59:43.525 --> 00:59:44.900
of what we're
talking about here?

00:59:48.121 --> 00:59:48.620
OK.

00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.270
What I want to talk about
next, and this will pretty much

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:54.950
be where we'll stop,
although a few other things

00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.260
we might mention
if we have time,

00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:59.180
I want to talk about
how it solves the three

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.805
cosmological problems
that we have discussed

01:00:01.805 --> 01:00:07.120
of the conventional
Big Bang model.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.750
And the explanations are
actually quite simple.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.890
So we can go through
them pretty quickly.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:20.410
First we had the horizons
slash homogeneity problem.

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:38.300
Remember that was caused, or
could be stated as, the problem

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.195
that the early universe
expanded so fast

01:00:42.195 --> 01:00:43.820
that the different
pieces of it did not

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:45.710
have time to talk to each other.

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:49.620
And, in particular, when the
cosmic microwave background was

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.850
released, points at opposite
sides of the universe

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.870
were separated from each other
by about maybe 50 horizon

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.594
distances, we calculated.

01:00:57.594 --> 01:01:00.010
And that means there's no way
they could have communicated

01:01:00.010 --> 01:01:02.540
with each other, and
therefore no way we

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.510
could explain how
they turned out

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.930
to have the same temperature
at the same time.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.970
In this case, what
we've done is,

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.350
we've inserted into the
history of the universe

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:16.910
an extra phase of evolution,
the inflationary phase.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.510
And if we go back
to the beginning

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:20.390
of the inflationary
phase, we see

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:22.035
that that problem
is just not there.

01:01:22.035 --> 01:01:24.700
And if it's not there,
it doesn't develop later.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.890
At the beginning of
the inflationary phase,

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:30.000
by assumption, the region that
we're starting to talk about

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.570
was about horizon
length in size.

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.990
And if we had enough inflation
to produce 10 centimeters out

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:38.550
of that, that was 10
times more than we needed,

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.990
it would mean that the entire
observed universe would

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.910
be coming from a region
that would be only

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:46.480
about a tenth of the size
of this Hubble length.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.290
So that would therefore
be well inside the horizon

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.230
at that time.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:55.810
And that means that if you
allow a little bit of leeway

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:59.130
with these numbers by having a
little bit of extra inflation,

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:02.240
there can be plenty of time
for the entire region that's

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:05.900
going to become our
personally observed region,

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.250
to come to a uniform temperature
by the ordinary processes

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.990
of thermal equilibrium.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.940
Because they're much less than
the horizon distance apart.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.410
And then once the uniformity is
established, before inflation,

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:20.440
when the region that
we're talking about

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:25.170
is incredibly tiny, inflation
takes over and stretches

01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.400
that tiny region
so that today, it's

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.290
large enough to encompass
everything that we see.

01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:31.790
And therefore
everything that we see

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.710
had a causally
connected past and had

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:38.186
time at the early stages to come
to uniform temperature, which

01:02:38.186 --> 01:02:42.080
is then preserved as
the whole thing expands.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.240
So that gives a very
simple explanation

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.830
for the homogeneity problem.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:03:04.190
Basically before inflation
the region was tiny.

01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:13.770
Second on our list was
the flatness problem.

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:24.390
And the basis of that
problem was the calculation

01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:28.440
that we did about how omega
minus 1 evolves in time.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.950
And we discovered
that omega minus 1

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.680
always grows in magnitude
during conventional evolution

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.190
of the universe.

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:41.560
And that therefore, for omega
minus 1 to be small today,

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.885
it would have to be amazingly
small in the early universe,

01:03:44.885 --> 01:03:51.520
as small as 10 to the minus
18 at one second after the Big

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.570
Bang to be consistent with
present measurements of omega

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.330
minus 1.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:00.975
The key element there was
this unstable equilibrium

01:04:00.975 --> 01:04:04.230
and the fact omega L minus
1 always grew with time.

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:06.440
And that depended on
the Friedman equations.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.350
During inflation, the
Friedman equations

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.350
in some schematic sense
were the same equations,

01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:13.840
but the rows that go
into it are different.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.840
So the equations
basically are different.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:18.040
And if we look at the key
equation, the first order

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:21.600
Friedman equation,
H squared equals

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:29.764
8 pi over 3 G row minus
Kc squared over a squared.

01:04:29.764 --> 01:04:31.180
This was the
equation that we used

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:34.932
to derive this flatness problem.

01:04:34.932 --> 01:04:36.390
We could see
immediately, if we now

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:39.580
think about it, during
the inflationary process,

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.750
things are completely reversed.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:45.670
Omega is driven towards
1, and exponentially fast.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.440
And the way I see that is to
just ask what is this equation

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.260
do during inflation.

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.120
And during inflation,
we just replace row

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.640
by this constant
value row sub f,

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.230
the energy density of the
false vacuum is fixed.

01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:01.510
And that means that during
inflation, this term is fixed.

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.120
This term is falling off
like 1 over a squared.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.120
And a is growing
exponentially with time.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.020
So that means that
this term is decreasing

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:16.720
relative to that term
by a huge factor,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.010
by the square of the
expansion factor.

01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:23.850
So in our sample
numbers over there,

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:27.660
we were talking about an
overall expansion from 10

01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:31.110
to the minus 27
centimeters to 10.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:33.163
That's expansion by a
factor of 10 to the 28.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.910
In that case, during
inflation, this term

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:58.350
decreases by a factor
of 10 to the 56

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:01.190
while this term
remains constant.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.130
And that means that
by the end inflation,

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.890
this is completely
negligible and this equation

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:09.240
without this extra term means
you have a flat universe.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.140
So during inflation,
the universe

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:15.450
is driven towards flatness,
like one over a squared, which

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:18.360
is 1 over the square of this
exponential expansion factor,

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.330
so very, very rapidly.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:49.410
And finally, the third of the
problems that we talked about

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:50.555
was the monopole problem.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.230
We argued, originally
Kibble argued,

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.890
that you'd expect approximately
one of these monopoles

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.530
to form per horizon volume,
just because the monopoles are

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:12.760
basically twists in
the scalar fields.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.760
And there's no way the scalar
fields can organize themselves

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.360
on distances larger than
the horizon distance.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:20.146
So you'd expect
something on order

01:07:20.146 --> 01:07:21.270
of-- It's a crude argument.

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:23.410
--but something on
the order of 1 not

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:27.710
in the scalar field
per horizon volume.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.030
And that led to far too
many magnetic monopoles,

01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:32.880
fantastically too many.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:36.960
And the formation of one
monopole per horizon volume

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.840
is hard to avoid.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:40.540
I don't know of any
way of avoiding it.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:42.980
But what gets us out
of the problem here,

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.380
is that we can easily arrange
in our inflationary model

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.640
for the bulk of the
inflation to happen

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.726
after the monopoles form.

01:07:51.726 --> 01:07:53.100
And that means
the monopoles will

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.230
be diluted by the
exponential expansion that

01:07:57.230 --> 01:08:00.260
will occur after
the monopoles form.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:01.850
The rest of the
matter is not diluted,

01:08:01.850 --> 01:08:03.400
because when
inflation takes place

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.200
it's at a constant
energy density

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.420
so the amount of other
stuff that will be produced

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.840
is not diminished by
this extra expansion.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.940
But the monopolies,
which will produce first,

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:18.000
will be thinned out
by the expansion.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:26.790
So the basic idea here
is that the volume goes

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:34.760
by a factor of the order,
using our sample numbers,

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.729
it's linearly growth by
a factor of 10 to the 28.

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:41.680
Volumes go like cubes
of linear distances.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.160
So 10 to the 28 cubed is
10 to the 84, I think.

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:49.905
Probably right.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.600
And that means that we
can dilute these monopoles

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.840
by a fantastic factor and make
everything work, if we just

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.569
arrange for the
monopoles to be produced

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.661
before the exponential
expansion sets in.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:08.939
OK.

01:09:08.939 --> 01:09:11.420
Finally, and I think
this is probably

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.762
the last thing we
will talk about,

01:09:16.762 --> 01:09:18.720
another problem that we
could have talked about

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.029
and we'll talk about
the solution of it

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:22.750
now, even though we never really
talked about as a problem,

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:27.234
is the small scale
nonuniformities

01:09:27.234 --> 01:09:27.900
of the universe.

01:09:36.177 --> 01:09:37.760
And if we look out
around the universe

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.609
we don't see a uniform
mass distribution,

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:43.529
we see stars and stars collected
in galaxies and galaxies

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:45.640
collected in clusters
and clusters collected

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.819
in super clusters, a very
complicated array of structure

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:51.410
in matter.

01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:53.290
Those are all nonuniformities.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.890
And we think we understand how
they evolve from early times

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.880
because we also see in the
cosmic microwave background

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.930
radiation, small fluctuations,
which we can now actually

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:07.050
measure to very high
degree of accuracy.

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:09.230
Those small fluctuations
provide the seeds

01:10:09.230 --> 01:10:12.350
for the structure in the
universe that happens later

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:16.380
because of the fact that the
universe is gravitationally

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.370
unstable.

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:21.060
So at very early times
what we're seeing directly

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.340
in the CMB, these
nonuniformities

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.660
were only at the level
of one part in 100,000.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.950
But nonetheless,
in regions where

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:30.510
there was slightly
more mass density,

01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:32.680
that pulls in
slightly more matter,

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.940
producing still stronger
gravitational field

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:38.590
pulling in more matter and that
amplifies the fluctuations.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:41.180
And that affect, we believe,
is enough to account

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.000
for all the structure that
we see in the universe

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.920
as originating from these tiny
ripples on the cosmic microwave

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.004
background.

01:10:49.004 --> 01:10:50.420
But that still
leaves the question

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.100
of where do these tiny
ripples come from.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.740
And in conventional
cosmology, one really

01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:59.810
had no idea where
they come from.

01:10:59.810 --> 01:11:03.220
One knew they had to be there
even before they were seen

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.850
because we had to account for
the structure in the universe

01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:07.250
and how it evolved.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.021
When they finally were seen,
it was seen just right.

01:11:10.021 --> 01:11:11.020
Everything fit together.

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:17.780
In inflationary cosmology,
the exponential expansion

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.600
tends to smooth everything out.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.220
And for a while, those
of us working on it

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.470
were very worried that inflation
would produce a perfectly

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:28.980
smooth universe and we'd
have no way of accounting

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.320
for the small fluctuations
that were needed to explain

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.230
the existence of
stars and galaxies.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.340
But then it was realized
that quantum theory

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.210
can come to our rescue.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:43.530
Classically, inflation
would smooth everything out

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:46.560
and produce a uniform
mass density everywhere.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.310
But quantum
mechanically, because

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:54.400
quantum mechanical theories are
fundamentally probabilistic,

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.510
the classical prediction
of a uniform density

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:59.920
turns into a quantum mechanical
prediction of an almost uniform

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.240
density, but with some
places being slightly higher

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.330
than that uniform density, other
places being slightly lower.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:07.960
And qualitatively,
that's exactly what

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.396
we see in the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

01:12:11.396 --> 01:12:13.270
And furthermore, we can
do it quantitatively.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.790
One can actually
calculate the effects

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:18.070
of these quantum fluctuations.

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:19.990
And that's what I
want to show you now.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.690
The actual data on that,
which is just gorgeous.

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:28.095
Shown here is the
Planck seven year data.

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:37.410
Shown here is the
Planck seven year data,

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:39.590
where what's being
plotted is the amplitude

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:43.600
of the fluctuations versus
the angular wave length.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.070
One is seeing these as
a pattern on the sky.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.800
So the wavelength you see as
an angle, not as a distance.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.060
And long wave lengths
are at the left.

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.940
Short waive lengths
are at the right.

01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.830
It's really done as
a multiple expansion,

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:57.996
if you know what that means.

01:12:57.996 --> 01:13:00.700
And those numbers are
showing on the top.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:05.600
And the data points are
shown as these black bars

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.980
with their appropriate errors.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:10.540
And the red line is the
theoretical prediction

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.920
due to inflation, putting
in the amount of dark matter

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.710
that we need to fit
the data that we also

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.140
measure from the supernovae.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:20.712
And it's absolutely gorgeous.

01:13:20.712 --> 01:13:22.420
So I have a little
Eureka guy to show you

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.240
how happy I was when
I saw this graph.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.960
And with the help
of Max Tegmark,

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:31.040
we've also put on
this graph what

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.830
other theories of
cosmology would give.

01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:36.950
So if we had an
open universe, where

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:40.390
omega was just 0.2 or 0.3,
as many people believed

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:45.080
before 1998, we would have
gotten this yellow line.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.720
If we had inflation
without dark energy,

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.650
making omega equal what out of
matter, out of ordinary matter,

01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:53.650
we would get this
greenish line, which

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:55.760
also doesn't fit
the data at all.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.760
And there's also something
called cosmic strings

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.165
that we haven't talked about.

01:13:59.165 --> 01:14:01.890
It was for a time, thought
to be a possible source

01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.800
of the fluctuations
in the universe.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.447
But once this data came in, that
became completely ruled out.

01:14:08.447 --> 01:14:10.030
Now this is not quite
the latest data.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:12.820
The latest data come from
the Planck satellite.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.850
And it was released last March.

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.890
And I don't have that
plotted on the same scale,

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:20.010
but this is the latest
data which, as you see,

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:24.209
fits even more gorgeously
than the data from WMAP.

01:14:24.209 --> 01:14:25.750
The more accurately
it gets measured,

01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:29.700
the better it fits the
theoretical expectations.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:32.120
Now I should mention for
truth in advertising,

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:36.400
that this data is to some
extent fit to the model.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:40.590
It's actually a
six parameter fit.

01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:42.820
But of those six parameters,
I don't have time

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.930
to talk about them in
detail, but four of them

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:49.420
are pretty much determined
by other features.

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:50.976
Two of them are just
fit to the data.

01:14:50.976 --> 01:14:52.350
And one of them
is something that

01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:55.030
changes the shape a little bit.

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:57.900
It's the opacity of
the space between us

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.440
and the surface of
last scattering.

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.280
An important parameter that's
fit that you should know about,

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.860
is the height of the curve.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.110
The height of the curve
can, in principle,

01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:09.240
be predicted by
inflation if you knew

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.340
the full details of
this potential energy

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.700
function that I've erased
for the scalar field.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:14.330
But we don't.

01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:15.930
We just have some
qualitative idea

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:17.440
about what it might look like.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.990
So the height of the
curve is fit to the data.

01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:23.010
But nonetheless, the location of
all these peaks and everything

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.640
really just come out of the
theory and it's just gorgeous.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.070
And it works wonderfully.

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:30.410
So the bottom line
is I think inflation

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:33.680
does look like a very good
explanation for the very

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.830
early universe.

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:37.750
It's kind of bizarre since
it talks about times like 10

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:41.140
to the minus 35 seconds
after the Big Bang which

01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.310
seemed like a totally incredible
extrapolation from physics

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.410
that we know.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:48.750
But nonetheless,
marvelously, it produces

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:53.760
data that agrees fantastically
with what astronomers are now

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.157
measuring.

01:15:55.157 --> 01:15:55.990
So we'll stop there.

01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:58.387
I want to thank you all
for being in the class.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.970
It's really been a
fun class to teach.

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:02.990
I have very much enjoyed
all of your questions

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:04.710
and enjoyed getting
to know you and hope

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:06.630
to continue to see you around.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:08.330
Thank you.
