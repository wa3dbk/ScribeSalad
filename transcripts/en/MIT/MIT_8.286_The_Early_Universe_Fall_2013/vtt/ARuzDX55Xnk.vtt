00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000
PROFESSOR: I'd like
to begin by reviewing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.879
the last lecture,
where we introduced

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.253
the idea of
non-Euclidean spaces.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.610
The important idea here is that
general relativity describes

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.920
gravity as a distortion
of space and time.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.880
And that idea becomes
crucial in cosmology,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.550
so we want to understand
what that's about.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.070
As I explained last
time, there are really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
two aspects to this
general subject.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
There's the question of, how
do we treat curved spacetimes

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.960
and how do particles,
for example, behave

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.349
when they move through
curved spacetimes.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.280
That we will be doing.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.110
There's also the
important question

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.420
of how does matter distort
the spacetime, which

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.410
is the Einstein field equations.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.790
That we will not do.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.420
That we will leave for the
general relativity course

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.040
that you may or may not want
to take at some point, or maybe

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.710
you already have.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.720
The idea of non
Euclidean geometry

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.740
really goes back
to Euclid himself,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.900
and the fifth postulate.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.640
The distinction between
Euclidean geometry and what

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.570
is generally called non
Euclidean geometry is entirely

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.870
in the fifth postulate.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.534
We never bothered changing
the first four postulates.

00:01:43.534 --> 00:01:45.200
This fifth postulate
is explained better

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.680
in the next slide,
where we have a diagram.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.767
The fifth postulate says that
if a straight line falls on

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:57.420
to other straight lines,
such that the sum of the two

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.240
included angles is
less than pi, then

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.010
these two lines will
meet on the same side

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.450
where the sum of the
angles is less than pi,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.509
and will not meet
on the other side.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.890
This postulate was something
that attracted attention,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.640
really from the very
beginning, because it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.420
seems like a much more
complicated postulate

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.690
than the other four.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.960
And for many years,
mathematicians

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.830
tried to derive this
postulate from the others,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.250
thinking that it couldn't really
be a fundamental postulate.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.130
But that never worked, and
eventually in the 17 and 1800s,

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.932
mathematicians realized that
the postulate was independent.

00:02:40.932 --> 00:02:43.390
And you could either assume
it's true or assume it's false.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.240
And you get different versions
of geometry in the two cases.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.570
We learned last time that there
are four other ways, at least,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.220
of stating the things that
are equivalent to the fifth

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.560
postulate, and they're
diagrammed here.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.340
If a straight line intersects
one of two parallel lines,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.920
it will also
intersect the other.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.840
If one has a straight
line and another point,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.600
there is one and only one line
through that point, parallel

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.330
to the original line.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.430
If one has a figure,
one can construct

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.400
a figure which is similar
to it, of any size.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.630
And finally, the
famous statement

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.110
about sum of the
angles that make up

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.420
the vertices of a triangle.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.640
If there exists just one
triangle for which it's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.822
180 degrees, then
that's equivalent

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:34.280
to the fifth
postulate, and you can

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.350
prove that every
triangle has 180 degrees.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.280
The fifth postulate was
questioned in a serious way

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.180
by Giovanni Geralamo
Saccheri in the 16, 1700s,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.660
who wrote a detailed study of
what geometry would be like

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.180
if the fifth
postulate were false.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.080
He wrote this believing that the
fifth postulate must be true.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.600
And he was looking for a
contradiction, which he never

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.240
found.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.360
Things went further in the later
1700s, with Gauss and Bolyai

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.980
and Lobachevski, who
independently developed

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.170
the geometry that we call
Gauss Bolyai Lobachevski

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.530
geometry, which is a two
dimensional geometry,

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.246
non Euclidean.

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:30.365
It corresponds to what we
now call an open universe,

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:35.600
that we'll be learning about
in more detail later today.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.450
The Gauss Bolyai
Lobachevski geometry

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.930
was treated purely axiomatically
by the three authors

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.580
that I just mentioned.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.740
But it was given a
coordinate representation

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.730
by Felix Klein in
1870, which was really

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.520
the first demonstration
that it really existed.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.190
When one treats
it axiomatically,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.050
one still always
has the possibility

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.060
that some contradiction
could be found someplace.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.360
But by the time you put it
into algebraic equations,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.900
then it becomes as consistent
as our understanding

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.480
of the real numbers, which
we have a lot of confidence

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.690
in, even though I don't
think mathematicians really

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.530
know how to prove the
consistency of anything.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.870
But we have a lot of confidence
in this kind of mathematics.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.920
So by 1870, it was
absolutely clear

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.600
that this open geometry,
this non-Euclidean geometry,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.400
was a perfectly consistent,
is a perfectly consistent,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.845
formulation of geometry.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.390
An important development
coming out of Kline's work

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.630
is that the idea about
how one describes geometry

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.400
changed dramatically.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.040
Prior to Kline,
essentially all of geometry

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.500
was done in the same
way that Euclid did it,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.210
by writing down axioms
and then proving theorems.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.420
Kline realized that you
could gain a lot of mileage

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.370
by taking advantage of our
understanding of algebra

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.270
and calculus by describing
things in terms of functions.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.580
And in particular,
geometry is described

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.590
by giving a distance
function between points.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.970
This was further
developed by Gauss,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.835
who realized that
distances are additive.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:18.460
So if distances mean
anything like what

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.080
we think distances
mean, it would

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.100
be sufficient to describe
the distance between any two

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.980
arbitrarily close points.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.230
And then if you want to know
the distance between two

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.780
distant points, you draw
a line between them,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.560
and measure the
length of that line

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.250
by adding up an infinite number
of infinitesimal segments.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.180
So the idea that distances need
only be defined infinitesimally

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.810
was very crucial to our current
understanding of geometry.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.390
Gauss also introduced
another important idea,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.480
which is a restriction on what
that infinitesimal distance

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.850
function should look like.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.850
Gauss proposed that
it should always

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.120
have the same
quadratic form that it

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.170
has for Euclidean distances.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.780
For Euclidean distances,
the Pythagorean theorem

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.640
tells us that the distance
between any two points

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.640
is the sum of the squares
of the coordinate distances.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.140
And for non-Euclidean
geometry, we generalize that

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.850
by allowing each term in
this quadratic expansion

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:23.040
to have its own prefactor,
and those prefactors

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.910
could be functions of position.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.800
So g sub xx of xy is just
a function of x and y.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.040
And g sub xy is another
function of x and y.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.970
And g sub yy is another
function of x and y.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.570
And the distance
function is taken

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.400
as the sum of those three terms.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.050
The important feature that that
quadratic form corresponds to,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:52.570
which was noticed by Gauss, is
that if the distance function

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.570
has that form, it means that
even though the space is not

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.420
Euclidean and will
not obey, in general,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.105
the axioms of
Euclidean geometry--

00:07:59.105 --> 00:08:01.340
and in particular
the fifth postulate--

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.270
it is still true that in
a very tiny neighborhood,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.010
it will resemble
Euclidean geometry, where

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.050
the resemblance will
become more and more exact

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.770
as you confine yourself
to tinier and tinier

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.170
neighborhoods.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.430
And we're kind of aware
of this in everyday life.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.200
The surface of the earth is
approximately spherical-- we'll

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.780
ignore little things like
mountains and roads and bumps,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.420
and pretend the surface
of the Earth is spherical.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.805
Nonetheless, the surface of
the Earth looks flat to us.

00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:33.429
And the reason it
looks flat is that we

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.140
see only a tiny
little bit of it.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.370
And a tiny piece of a curved
surface always looks flat.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.929
And mathematically
speaking, the way

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.000
to introduce enough assumptions
to validate that conclusion

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.570
is to assume that the
local distance function is

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.840
a quadratic function
of this form.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.840
And what Gauss
originally proved is

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.840
that if the distance
function is of that form,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.260
it is always true that
in a tiny neighborhood,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.160
to an arbitrary accuracy, you
could define new coordinates--

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.310
x prime and y prime in the
notation of this diagram--

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.040
where in terms of
the new coordinates

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.510
in the tiny neighborhood,
the distances are just

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.030
the Euclidean distances.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.870
ds squared equals dx prime
squared plus dy prime squared.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.460
And that's a very crucial fact
that we will be making use of,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.919
Einstein made use
of, in the context

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:25.960
of general relativity,
which we'll be getting to.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.360
OK, that finishes the review.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.150
Any questions about anything
that we talked about last time?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.100
OK, great.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.330
Now what we want
to do is to go on

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.400
to apply these ideas in detail.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.800
In one of them in particular,
build up a full description

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.670
of closed and open
universes today.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.720
And we are going
to begin by giving

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.260
a mathematical description
of the simplest

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.650
non-Euclidean geometry
that we have available,

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.510
which is just the surface of
a sphere-- a two dimensional

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.320
sphere embedded in
three dimensions.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.850
That is, a two
dimensional surface

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.800
embedded in a three
dimensional space,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.770
as is intended to be
shown in that diagram.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.170
The sphere is described
simply by x squared plus y

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.160
squared equals plus z
squared equals r squared,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.700
where x, y, and z are just
Euclidean coordinates.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.530
So in this case,
our curved space,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.450
which is the surface
of the sphere,

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.830
can be embedded in a Euclidean
space of one higher dimension.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.050
That's not always the case.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.490
We should not pretend that
that will always be the case.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.420
But when it is the
case, it allows

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.460
us to study that curved surface
in a very straightforward way,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.010
because everything
is really determined

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.960
by the Euclidean geometry of the
space in which this sphere is

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.630
embedded.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.400
Nonetheless, when
we're done formalizing

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.070
our description of the
surface of the sphere,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.650
the goal will be to concentrate
on what Gauss called

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.110
the "inner properties," namely
the properties of the surface

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.672
itself.

00:10:58.672 --> 00:11:00.880
And we will try to pretend
that the three dimensional

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.420
space never even existed.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.890
It won't be required
for anything

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.100
that we'll be left
with, once we have

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.060
a solid description
of the surface itself.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.900
And this will be very important
for what we'll be doing later.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.240
So it is important to get
in touch with the idea

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.010
that we're going to study this
sphere, making use of the fact

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.610
that it could be embedded in
three Euclidean dimensions.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:26.710
But in the end, we want to
think of it as a two dimensional

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.950
geometry, which
is non Euclidean.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.790
OK, so our goal will
be to write down

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.020
the distance function
for some coordinization

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.000
of the surface of the sphere.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.790
I should say at the beginning,
when this picture makes

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.320
it most obvious, that one
of the reasons we might

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.630
be interested in the surface
of a sphere, if we're

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.520
interested in cosmology, is
that we know that we're trying

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.540
to build cosmological
models that

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.284
are consistent with
homogeneity and isotropy.

00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:55.700
Because we discussed
earlier those

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.380
are, to a very good
approximation, valid features

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.950
of the universe that
we're living in.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.984
So the surface of a sphere
has those properties.

00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:06.650
It's certainly
homogeneous, in the sense

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.780
that any point on the
surface of a sphere

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.110
will look exactly
like any other point.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.620
If you were living
on that sphere,

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.790
and you didn't have
any other landmarks,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.620
you'd have no way of knowing
where on the sphere you were.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.390
Furthermore, it's isotropic--
same in all directions.

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.180
And when I say
that, it's important

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.410
that I really mean it in
the context of the two

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.050
dimensional surface, not the
three dimensional geometry.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.050
So the three dimensional
geometry is isotropic.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.674
If you sat at the
center of that sphere

00:12:34.674 --> 00:12:36.979
and looked any direction
in three dimensions,

00:12:36.979 --> 00:12:38.270
everything would look the same.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.650
But that's not the isotropy
that's important for us.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.200
We want to imagine ourselves
as two dimensional creatures

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.002
living on the surface.

00:12:46.002 --> 00:12:48.460
And then you can imagine that
if you were a two dimensional

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.640
creature living on the
surface-- so you happen

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.765
to be at the North Pole,
because that's the easiest

00:12:52.765 --> 00:12:55.690
to describe-- you could
imagine looking around

00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.715
in a circle, 360%
available, and the world

00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:02.840
that you'd be living in
would look exactly the same

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.120
in all directions
on the surface.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.890
And that's the isotropy
that's important to us,

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.280
because the two
dimensional surface here

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.900
is what we're soon
going to generalize

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.150
to be our three
dimensional world.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:22.140
And it's isotropy within that
world that we're talking about.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.900
OK, so, first thing
we wanted to do

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.070
is to put coordinates on
our two dimensional surface.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.950
If we want to ultimately
forget the third dimension

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.230
and live in the
surface, we want to have

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.070
coordinates to use
in the surface.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.645
It's a two dimensional
surface, so it

00:13:37.645 --> 00:13:39.960
should have two coordinates.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.790
And when we use the
usual coordinization

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.406
of a sphere, polar
coordinates, well, it

00:13:46.406 --> 00:13:49.230
will be two angles,
theta and phi.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:52.726
And there are some
different dimensions

00:13:52.726 --> 00:13:54.100
that are used in
different books,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.600
but I think almost all physics
book use these conventions.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.250
Theta is an angle
measured from the z-axis,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:05.500
and phi is an angle measured
by taking the point that you're

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.810
trying to describe, which is
that dot there, projecting it

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.030
down into the xy plane,
and in the xy plane,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.460
measuring the angle
from the x-axis.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.230
So that's phi.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.690
And theta and phi are the polar
coordinates describing a point

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.065
on the surface of the sphere.

00:14:23.065 --> 00:14:25.630
And what we want to do is
describe the distance function

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.880
in terms of those polar
coordinates-- that's our goal.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.695
OK, to describe the
distance function, what

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:43.670
we want to imagine is two
infinitesimally nearby points--

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:47.390
one described by
coordinates theta and phi,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:53.500
and one described by theta plus
d theta and phi plus d phi.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.120
So we have one point
described by theta and phi,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:06.230
and another point described by
theta plus d theta, phi plus d

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.850
phi.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.532
So the coordinate changes
are just d theta and d phi.

00:15:10.532 --> 00:15:12.240
What we want to know
is how much distance

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.720
is undergone by moving
from the first point

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.920
to the second point.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.710
And the easiest way to see
it is to make the changes one

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.710
at a time.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.080
So first, we can
just vary theta.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.290
And if we just
vary theta, we see

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.840
that the point described
by theta and phi moves

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.640
along a great circle, which
goes through the z-axis.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.570
And the distance
that the point goes

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.170
is just an arc length as a
piece of that great circle.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:53.090
And since this attended angle
is d theta, and the radius is r,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.750
the distance of that
arc length really

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.270
just follows from the definition
of an angle in radians.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.870
The arc length is
r times d theta,

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.390
and that's really the definition
of d theta in radians.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:14.870
So if we vary theta
only, the distance ds

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.710
is just equal to
r times d theta.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.960
Everybody happy with that?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.850
OK.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.010
Now if we vary phi, it's
slightly more complicated,

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.400
but not much.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.117
If we vary phi, the
point being described

00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.950
would-- if you vary phi
all the way around--

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.590
make a circle around the z-axis.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.790
That circle does
not have radius r.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.600
That's the one thing that may
be a little bit surprising,

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.710
until you look at the picture
and see that it's true.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:50.350
The radius of that circle
is r times sine theta.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.540
So in particular,
if theta were 0,

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.060
if you're up around the
North Pole, going around

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.720
that circle would just be
going around the point.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.230
0 radius.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.180
And you have maximum radius
when you're at the equator,

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.660
going all the way around.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.650
So again, we're
going in a circle

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.740
through an angle--
in this case d phi.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.680
So the arc length is just
the angle times the radius.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:19.270
But the radius is r times
sine theta, not r itself.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:35.450
So when we vary phi only, ds
is equal to r times sine theta

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.160
times d phi.

00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:43.380
Any questions?

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.100
OK, now, the next
important thing to notice

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.820
is that these two
variations that we made

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.730
are orthogonal to each other.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.000
When we varied phi, we moved
in the horizontal plane.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.030
There's only motion in the x and
y directions when we vary phi.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:04.450
When we vary theta, we move
in the vertical direction.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.170
And those two vectors
are orthogonal,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.970
as you can see from the diagram.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.270
And because we have two
orthogonal distances

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.490
that we're adding
up, and because we're

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.660
in underlying Euclidean
space here-- we

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.360
can think of those distances
as being distances in the three

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.280
dimensional Euclidean
space that we're

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.440
embedded in-- we get to use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:33.670
So putting together
these two variations,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:39.050
we get ds squared is equal to
an overall factor of r squared,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:46.530
times d theta squared plus sine
squared theta, d phi squared.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.340
And that formula then
describes the metric

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.450
on the surface of a sphere.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.243
And it describes a
non-Euclidean geometry.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.250
And once we have
that metric, we can

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.940
forget the three
dimensional picture

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.270
that we've been
drawing, and just

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.800
think of a world
in which there are

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.460
two coordinates-- theta and
phi-- with that distance

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.020
function.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.353
And that's the way we want
to be able to think about it.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.680
OK, everybody happy?

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:25.930
OK, I want to mention,
because it is perhaps

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.110
useful in other cases, depending
on your taste of how you like

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.900
to solve problems-- the
description I just gave

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:38.015
of deriving this formula
was geometric, that

00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:40.190
is, we drew pictures and
wrote down the answer

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.890
based on visualizing
the pictures.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.280
But it can also be done
purely algebraically.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.470
To do it purely
algebraically, one

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:54.330
would first write
down formulas that

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:57.900
relayed the angular
coordinates--

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.075
I should go back to slides.

00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:07.530
What's going on here?

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.495
Is my computer frozen?

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.610
[INAUDIBLE] Yes?

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.068
AUDIENCE: For that
formula, are you

00:20:29.068 --> 00:20:32.719
assuming that d theta and d phi
are really small so that you

00:20:32.719 --> 00:20:35.490
can [INAUDIBLE] the triangle?

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.830
PROFESSOR: Yes, these are
infinitesimal separations only.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.490
That's the key idea of Gauss.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.100
And yes, we're
making use of that.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.100
This formula will not
hold if d theta and d phi

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.640
were large angles.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.125
Holds only when
they're infinitesimal.

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:51.625
Yes?

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:53.000
AUDIENCE: And then
similiarly, we

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.633
can use the line integral for
calculating the distances based

00:20:55.633 --> 00:20:56.382
on this metric?

00:20:56.382 --> 00:20:57.590
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's right.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.490
If we wanted to know the
distances between two finitely

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.260
separated points, we would
construct a line between them,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.470
and then integrate
along that line.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.310
And by line what we mean is
the path of shortest distance,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.760
which we'll be learning about
more next time, probably.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.080
Those are not necessarily
easy to calculate.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.560
In this case, they're
calculable, but not really

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.060
easy.

00:21:24.592 --> 00:21:25.425
Any other questions?

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.300
OK, so what I wanted
to do was to look

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.690
at the definition of the
coordinate system, as now

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.769
shown on the screen.

00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:38.810
And from that, we can
write down the relationship

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.000
between x, y, and z,
and theta and phi.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.400
And those relationships
are that x

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.060
is equal to r times sine
theta times cosine phi.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:56.850
y is equal to r times
sine theta times sine phi.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.070
And z is equal to r
times cosine theta.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.750
And once one writes
those formulas,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.370
then one can just use
straightforward calculus

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.740
to get the metric,
without needing

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.070
to draw any pictures at all.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.050
You may have wanted to draw
pictures to get these formulas,

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.720
but once you have
these formulas,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.390
you can get that by
straightforward calculus.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:29.280
I'll sketch the calculation
without writing it out in full.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:35.790
But given this formula
for x, we can write down

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:40.780
what dx is by calculus,
by chain rule.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.860
So dx-- it's a function
of two variables.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:48.100
So it would be the partial of x,
with respect to theta, times d

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.620
theta, plus the
partial derivative

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.315
of x, with respect
to phi, times d phi.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.230
And we'll go work out what
these partial derivatives are

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.460
if I differentiate this
with respect to theta.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.970
The sine theta turns
into cosine theta.

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:18.330
So the first term becomes
r cosine theta, cosine phi,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.350
d theta.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:23.170
And then plus, from here we have
the partial of x with respect

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.070
to phi.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.970
We just differentiate this
expression with respect to phi.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.000
The derivative of cosine
phi is minus sine phi.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:46.560
So the plus sign becomes a minus
sign-- r sine theta, sine phi d

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.320
phi.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.800
And then I won't
continue, but we

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.520
could do the same
thing for dy and dz.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.450
And once we have expressions
for dx, dy, and dz, we

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:06.750
can calculate ds squared, using
the fact again that all of this

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.309
is embedded in Euclidean space.

00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:10.350
That's where we're starting,
although in the end,

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.140
we want to forget
that Euclidean space.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.730
But we could still
make use of it

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:19.300
here, and write ds squared is
equal to dx squared, plus dy

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.875
squared, plus dz squared.

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.840
One can then plug in the
expression that we have for dx,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:32.500
in terms of d theta and d phi,
and the analogous expressions

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:38.080
that I'm not writing
down for dy and dz.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.690
And when one puts
them in here, one

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.060
makes lots of use
of the identity

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.700
that cosine squared plus
sine squared equals 1

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.900
And after using that identity
a number of times, what you get

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.230
when you just put
together this algebra

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:58.030
is exactly what we had
before-- r squared times

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:05.230
d theta squared, plus sine
squared theta, d phi squared.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.620
So the important
point is that once you

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.400
have the identities that relate
these two different coordinate

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.420
systems, and if you know the
distance function in the xyz

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.120
coordinate system,
you're home free,

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.030
as far as geometry is concerned.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.390
One could just use calculus
from there on if one wants to.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:32.712
Although usually the geometric
pictures make things easier.

00:25:32.712 --> 00:25:33.920
OK, any questions about that?

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:51.840
OK in that case, we are
now ready to move on,

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.640
having discussed
the two dimensional

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.802
surface of a sphere embedded
in three Euclidean dimensions.

00:25:57.802 --> 00:25:59.760
The next thing I'd like
to do-- and this really

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.727
will be our closed
universe cosmology--

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.560
we're going to discuss
the three dimensional

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.850
surface of a sphere in
four Euclidean dimensions

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.740
by analogy.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.370
The previous exercise
was a warm- up.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:19.290
Now we want to introduce a four
dimensional Euclidean space.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:45.000
So our sphere now
will obey the equation

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.990
x squared plus y squared
plus z squared plus-- we need

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.910
a new letter for our new
dimension in our four

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:58.800
dimensional space, and I'm
using w. x, y, z, and w.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:09.550
So that equation describes
a three dimensional sphere

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.260
in a four dimensional
Euclidean space.

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.700
And our goal is to do the
same thing to that equation

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.500
that we just did to the two
dimensional sphere embedded

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.510
in a three dimensional space.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:23.850
Now of course it becomes much
harder to visualize anything.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.650
If you ask how do we do
visualize things in four

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.670
dimensions, I think probably the
best answer is that we usually

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.310
don't.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.852
And what we're going to
take advantage of mainly

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.560
is that once you know
how to write things

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.810
in terms of equations,
you don't usually

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:40.470
have to visualize things.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.100
Or if you do, you
can usually get by,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:47.580
by visualizing subspaces
of the full space.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.250
If you want to visualize
the full sphere

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:56.560
in some rational way, I think
the crutch that I usually use,

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.550
and that most people
use, is if you

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.120
have just one extra
dimension, in this case w,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.010
try to think of w as
a time coordinate.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.926
Even though it's not
really a time coordinate,

00:28:05.926 --> 00:28:08.440
it still gives you a way
of visualizing things.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.200
So if we think of w as
a time coordinate here,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.500
the smallest possible value
of w would be minus r.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.240
The maximum possible
value of w would

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.440
be plus r, consistent
with this constraint,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.810
consistent with
being on the sphere.

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.520
So when w is equal to minus
r, the other coordinates

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.789
have to be 0 to be on the
surface of the sphere.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.580
So you can think of
that as a sphere that's

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.660
just appearing at time minus
1, with initially 0 radius.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.900
Then as w increases, x
squared plus y squared plus z

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.230
squared increases.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.240
So you could think of it
sphere that starts at 0 size,

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.620
gets bigger, gets as
big as r in radius

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.530
when w equals 0 and then gets
smaller again and disappears.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.036
So that's one way of thinking
of this four dimensional sphere.

00:28:53.036 --> 00:28:53.536
Yes?

00:28:53.536 --> 00:28:53.921
AUDIENCE: Is that
kind of like looking

00:28:53.921 --> 00:28:55.486
at the cross sections
of the sphere?

00:28:55.486 --> 00:28:57.110
PROFESSOR: Is that
kind of like looking

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.170
at the cross sections
of the sphere?

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:58.841
Exactly, yes.

00:28:58.841 --> 00:29:00.840
One is looking at cross
sections of the sphere--

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.160
successive cross sections
at successive values of w.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.595
And if you do it in succession,
it makes w act like a time

00:29:07.595 --> 00:29:07.910
coordinate.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.330
But you're right.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.830
The fact that w is
a time coordinate

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.087
is kind of irrelevant.

00:29:11.087 --> 00:29:12.545
You could imagine
just drawing them

00:29:12.545 --> 00:29:14.380
on a piece of
paper in any order.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.630
And for any fixed
value of w, you're

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.970
seeing a cross section of
what this sphere looks like.

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:22.994
That is how the xyz coordinates
behave for a fixed value of w.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:30.800
Now to coordinatize the
surface of our sphere.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.232
Last time we used
two coordinates,

00:29:32.232 --> 00:29:33.940
because we had a two
dimensional surface.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.350
This time we're going
to want to use three

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.350
coordinates, because this
is a three dimensional

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:39.370
surface that we're describing.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:44.087
And that means that we need
at least one new coordinate.

00:29:44.087 --> 00:29:46.170
And the new coordinate
that I'm going to introduce

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.880
will be another angle,
which I'm going to call psi.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.160
And the angle I'm going to
define, as in this diagram,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.250
as the angle from the
new axis, the w axis.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:04.880
So psi is the angle of any
arbitrary point to the w axis.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.810
And therefore the
w coordinate itself

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:13.390
is going to be r times cosine
psi, just by projecting.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.810
And the square root of the sum
of x squared plus y squared

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:23.250
plus z squared is then the
other component of that vector.

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.980
And beyond the sphere,
it's easy to see

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.980
that the square root of
x squared plus y squared

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.870
plus z squared has to
be r times sine psi.

00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:36.050
OK, now we still need
two more coordinates.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.000
This is only one coordinate--
we want to have three.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.030
But the two other coordinates
will just be our old friends,

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:46.930
theta and phi We're going
to keep theta and phi.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.580
And in order to keep
them, what we'll

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.640
imagine doing is that for
any point on the surface

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.890
of this three dimensional sphere
of the four dimensional space,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.840
we could imagine just
ignoring the w coordinate.

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.627
And then we have x,
y, and z-coordinates,

00:31:00.627 --> 00:31:02.960
and we can just ask what are
the values of theta and phi

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.790
that would go with those
x, y, and z-coordinates.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.230
So theta and phi are just
defined by quote, "projecting"

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:13.280
the original point into the
three dimensional xyz space,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.800
which just means ignore the
w coordinates, look at xyz,

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.930
and ask what would be
the angular coordinates,

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:24.010
theta and phi, for those
values of x,y, and z.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.285
And it's easy to take
those words I just said

00:31:26.285 --> 00:31:27.493
and turn them into equations.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.497
We like to write down the
analog of these equations.

00:31:38.497 --> 00:31:40.080
But we want to have
four equations now

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.540
that will specify x, y, z, and
w as a function of our three

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.870
angles, psi, theta, and phi.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.860
But that's not hard.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.201
I'll show you at
the bottom with w.

00:31:56.847 --> 00:32:04.900
w we already said is just
r times the cosine of psi.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:06.615
Just coming from
the fact that psi

00:32:06.615 --> 00:32:13.316
is defined as the angle from
the point to the w-axis,

00:32:13.316 --> 00:32:15.190
and that's enough as
you see from the picture

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:19.726
to imply that w is equal
to r times cosine psi.

00:32:19.726 --> 00:32:24.810
The other point, x,y, and z,
really just follow by induction

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.810
from what we already know.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.120
Each of these formulas
will hold in the three

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.840
dimensional subspace,
except that r,

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.520
the radius of a sphere in the
three dimensional subspace,

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:41.070
is not r anymore but
is r times sine psi.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:47.850
So x is equal to r
times sine psi times

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.880
what it was already--
sine theta cosine phi.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:33:06.290
y is equal to 4 times sine
psi times sine theta sine phi.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:15.157
And z is equal to r times
sine psi times cosine theta.

00:33:15.157 --> 00:33:16.740
So I just take each
of these equations

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.590
and multiply them by sine
psi to get the new equations.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.520
And you can
straightforwardly check--

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.160
if we take x squared plus y
squared plus z squared plus w

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.970
squared here, it makes
successive use of the identity

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.484
that sine squared plus
cosine squared equals 1.

00:33:33.484 --> 00:33:35.900
We'll be able to show that x
squared plus y squared plus z

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.572
squared plus w squared equals r
squared, like it's supposed to.

00:33:41.572 --> 00:33:43.780
OK, so is everybody happy
with this coordinatization?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.730
OK, I should
mention, by the way,

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:53.980
that if you ever have the need
to describe a sphere in 26

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:57.510
dimensions or whatever, this
process easily iterates,

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.640
once you've known
how to do it once.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.120
That is, every time you
add a new dimension,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.870
you invent a new letter
for the new axis.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:09.139
You define a new angle, which
is the angle from that access.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.670
And then the new
coordinatization

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.760
is just to set
the new coordinate

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.889
equal to r times the
cosine of the new angle.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.070
And then take all
the old equations

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.080
and put in an extra factor
of the sine of the new angle.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.362
And you got it.

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.320
So you could do that as
many times as you want,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.817
if you want to describe a
very high dimensional sphere.

00:34:29.817 --> 00:34:32.150
We should say something about
the range of these angles.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.330
The original angle phi--
maybe I should go back

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.120
a few slides now.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:47.650
The original angle phi, as
you can see from the slide,

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:53.610
goes around the xy plane, so
it has a range of 0 to 2 pi.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.932
The original angle theta is
an angle from the z-axis,

00:34:56.932 --> 00:34:58.390
and the furthest
you could never be

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.390
away from pointing towards an
axis is pointing away from it.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.010
And that's pi, not 2 pi.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.100
So theta has a range of 0 to pi.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.840
And similarly, psi
is also defined

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.830
as an angle from an axis.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.610
So again, the furthest
you could ever

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.200
be away from pointing towards an
axis is pointing away from it.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.260
So psi, like theta, will
have a range of 0 to pi.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.800
And if you ever need to
coordinatize a 26 dimensional

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.470
sphere, as I just mentioned,
you keep adding new angles.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.790
Each of the new angles
goes from 0 to pi.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:36.650
Thus each new angle
was introduced

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.790
as an angle between the point
that you're trying to describe

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.730
and the new axis.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:47.000
So, they're all angles
like theta and psi.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:57.460
So 0 is less than phi,
is less than 2 pi.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.700
But 0 is-- these should be less
than or equal to's-- 0 is less

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.130
than or equal to theta, is
less than or equal to pi.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:11.910
And 0 is less than
or equal to psi,

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.250
is less than or equal to pi.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.030
OK, next we want to get
the metric of our three

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.540
dimensional spherical
surface embedded in our four

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.920
dimensional Euclidean space.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:40.039
And I'm going to do it by
the geometric sort of way.

00:36:40.039 --> 00:36:41.580
I'll try to just
motivate the pieces.

00:36:44.794 --> 00:36:46.960
There'll be some cross here
between actually algebra

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.980
and geometry.

00:36:50.585 --> 00:36:51.960
Let's see, first
I should mention

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.240
that once you have this,
you can get the answer

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.380
by the same brute force process
that we describe, but didn't

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:58.360
really carry out here.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.860
That's tedious, but
it's pretty well

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.860
guaranteed to get you the
right answer if you're

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.700
careful enough, and does not
require drawing any pictures

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.300
or having any the
visualization of the geometry,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.880
so it does have some advantages.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.210
But I will not do it that way.

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.540
I will do it in a
geometric sort of way,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.370
because I think it's
easier to understand

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.480
the geometric sort of way.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.720
So here goes.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:25.370
As we did over there, we
will vary our coordinates one

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.980
at a time, and
then see how we can

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:31.189
combine the
different variations.

00:37:31.189 --> 00:37:33.480
Again we'll find that they're
orthogonal to each other.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.090
So I'll be able to combine them
just by adding the squares.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.130
But we don't necessarily
know that the beginning.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:45.800
So let's start by varying
psi, the new coordinate.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.260
And there, things
are very simple

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.070
because our new
coordinate is just

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.990
defined as the
angle from an axis.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.130
So if we vary psi,
the point in question

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.320
just makes a circle
around the origin,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.610
and the circle has radius,
capital R. So the variation

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.110
if I vary psi is
just r times d psi.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:19.300
So ds is equal to r times d psi.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.420
What could be simpler?

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:28.500
OK, now we'll imagine varying
either theta or phi or both.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.630
And since we already
pretty well understand

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.820
this three
dimensional subspace--

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.350
this is the previous
problem-- I'm

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.350
going to talk about varying
them simultaneously.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:47.030
So vary theta and phi.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:51.650
Well then we know that
ds squared is really

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.780
given by this formula.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.040
We are just varying
theta and phi

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.250
in a three dimensional space.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.450
The fourth direction
doesn't change in this case.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.530
But the radius involved is not
what we originally called r.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.620
But the radius in the
three dimensional space

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.192
is r times sine psi.

00:39:10.192 --> 00:39:11.650
That's the square
root of x squared

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.100
plus y squared plus z squared.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:23.280
So what we get is ds squared
is equal to R squared

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:30.200
times sine squared psi
times d theta squared

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.540
plus sine squared
theta, d phi squared.

00:39:41.722 --> 00:39:42.805
Everybody happy with that?

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.140
OK, now I'm going to
first jump ahead and then

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.360
come back and justify
what we're doing.

00:39:52.360 --> 00:40:04.090
But if these variations
are orthogonal-- which

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:06.650
I will argue shortly
that they are,

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.220
so I'm not doing
this for nothing--

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.970
if the variations
are orthogonal,

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.620
then we just add
the sum of squares

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.610
using the generalized
Pythagorean theorem.

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.860
In this case, Pythagorean
theorem in four dimensions--

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.510
that's four
Euclidean dimensions,

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:23.170
so we should be able to use it.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.070
So what we get for
our final answer is

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:33.270
ds squared is an overall
factor of r squared,

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:45.040
times d psi squared plus
sine squared psi, times d

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:53.800
theta squared, plus sine
squared theta, d phi squared.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.740
I just added the
sum of the squares.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.675
Now I need to justify
this orthogonality.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:43.970
OK, to do that, let me introduce
a vector notation in the four

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.690
dimensional space
of x,y z, and w.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:51.064
OK, we're justifying this in
the Euclidean embedding space.

00:41:51.064 --> 00:41:53.480
And the Euclidean embedding
space of these transformations

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.640
are orthogonal.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.730
So let me imagine varying psi.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.400
And then I could construct
a four dimensional vector

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.230
dr-- I'll call it
sub psi because it

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:12.537
arises from varying psi.

00:42:12.537 --> 00:42:14.120
So this is the four
dimensional vector

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.500
that describes the motion of
this point r as psi is varied.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.590
And first let me just give
these components names.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:29.510
I'll call it-- rather
than repeat the r,

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:35.291
I'm just going to call this
d psi sub x, d psi sub y,

00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:39.570
d psi sub z, and d psi sub w.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.270
This is just by definition.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.446
I'm just naming the
components of that vector.

00:42:47.446 --> 00:42:49.320
And since the vector
already has a subscript,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.820
I don't want to
have two subscripts.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.407
So I've changed the
name of the vector

00:42:54.407 --> 00:42:55.490
for writing as components.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:01.900
And similarly, here
I will just vary

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:05.470
one of these two angles, theta
and phi I'll just vary theta,

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:10.340
and let you know that
varying psi is no different,

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:12.470
and you can easily see that.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:17.590
So if I vary theta,
the variation

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:21.800
of r when I vary theta
will be dr sub theta.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:26.820
And its components I
will just call d theta

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:36.570
x, d theta y, d theta
z, and d theta w.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:37.820
So these are just definitions.

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.460
I haven't said any
actual facts yet.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.990
But I've defined
these two vectors,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.732
and given names to
their components.

00:43:45.732 --> 00:43:48.190
And now we want to look at them
and take their dot product.

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.606
Their dot product is just a
four dimensional Euclidean dot

00:43:50.606 --> 00:43:51.270
product.

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:56.560
So the dot product is just dx
times d theta d psi y d theta y

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:01.355
plus d psi z times d
theta z plus d-- blah.

00:44:01.355 --> 00:44:02.480
I think we should write it.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.890
So this actually is now a
fact about Euclidean geometry

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:11.170
in four dimensions.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.390
The dot product of
these two vectors

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:21.710
is just equal to the
product of the x components,

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:27.340
plus the product of
their y components,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:33.870
plus the product of
their z components,

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.230
plus the product of
their w components.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.915
And now what we want to
do is to look at this sum

00:44:49.915 --> 00:44:53.540
and argue they're 0, because
if they're orthogonal,

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.350
the dot product of two
vectors should be 0.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:03.150
OK, so let me first look
at the dr sub theta vector.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.720
OK, what do we know about it?

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.290
Well, we know that when we vary
theta, from these formulas,

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:21.980
w does not change--
and we can easily

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.550
see that from the
picture as well.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:30.280
So d theta sub w equals 0.

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.652
And since these are
all products, that

00:45:36.652 --> 00:45:38.110
means that this
last term vanishes,

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.327
no matter what d psi w is.

00:45:41.327 --> 00:45:43.410
So we know we don't need
to worry about that term.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.326
We only need to worry
about these three terms.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.800
Now what do we know
about those three terms?

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.390
If you look at dr sub theta,
and look at its three spacial

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.540
components-- x,y,
and z-- from here,

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.190
we could see that varying theta
does the same thing to x, y,

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:07.910
and z as it did over here,
except a different overall

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:09.590
factor out front.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:11.840
So in particular, what
I want to point out

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.240
is that varying
theta does not change

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.980
x squared plus y
squared plus z squared.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.900
It leaves it constant.

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.010
So if we think of
the xyz space, we

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:26.070
could imagine a sphere
in the xyz space,

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:29.540
and varying theta always
causes a variation

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.336
that's tangential
to that sphere.

00:46:31.336 --> 00:46:32.960
It never moves in
the radial direction.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:47.704
So the three vector, defined
by d theta x, d theta y,

00:46:47.704 --> 00:47:01.560
d theta z, is tangential in the
three dimensional subspace xyz.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.724
Just as it was when we
didn't have a w coordinate.

00:47:04.724 --> 00:47:06.640
The w coordinate doesn't
change anything here.

00:47:09.447 --> 00:47:11.030
So that's a little
bit [? soluable. ?]

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.010
Are people happy with that?

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:13.468
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.370
OK.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:31.680
Now we want to
look at dr sub psi,

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:36.622
and it will have a w
component-- d psi sub w--

00:47:36.622 --> 00:47:37.830
but we don't care about that.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.204
We know we don't care about
it because that piece already

00:47:40.204 --> 00:47:41.970
dropped out of our expression.

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.100
So we want to know
what this vector looks

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:47.040
like in the xyz space.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:50.060
We don't care about what it
looks like in the w space.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.120
So in the xyz space, we can
look at these formulas here.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.160
As we vary psi, x, y,
and z could change.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.180
But they all change
by the same factor--

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:05.030
whatever factor psi changes by.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:10.330
The same sign psi appears
in all three lines.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:13.840
So changing psi can only
multiply x, y, and z all

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.944
by the same factor.

00:48:14.944 --> 00:48:16.360
And what that means
is that if you

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.850
think of this geometrically
in the xyz space,

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.632
varying psi moves the point
only in the radial direction.

00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:23.840
If you multiply all of the
coordinates by a constant,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.480
you are just moving in
the radial direction.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.900
So dr psi has the property that
when we look at only its x, y,

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:42.840
and z components-- d
psi x d psi y, d psi z,

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.960
it is radial in the three
dimensional subspace.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:52.430
So, the sum of
these three terms--

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.590
this is what we're
trying to evaluate--

00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:00.760
is the dot product of a radial
vector and a tangential vector.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.349
And the dot product
of a radial vector

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:03.890
and the tangential
vector will always

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.931
be 0, because there are
orthogonal to each other.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:16.760
Sorry for the overlap
here, but equal 0,

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.020
and that's because radial is
perpendicular to tangential.

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.770
OK, everybody happy with that?

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:40.660
OK if so, we have
important result now.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:45.550
We have derived the metric for
the three dimensional surface

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:50.360
of a four dimensional sphere
embedded in four Euclidean

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.130
dimensions.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.590
And that, in fact, is
precisely the closed universe

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.800
of cosmology.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:58.350
It's the homogeneous
isotropic description

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.435
of a closed universe.

00:50:15.312 --> 00:50:17.645
OK, next thing I want to point
out is just a definition.

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.800
An important feature of
non Euclidean geometry

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.040
and general relativity--
because they're

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:33.800
connected to each other--
is that there never

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:38.420
is a unique, useful
coordinate system.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:41.911
And Euclidean spaces,
there is a unique, useful

00:50:41.911 --> 00:50:42.660
coordinate system.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:44.290
It's the Cartesian system.

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.011
Sometimes it's also useful
to use polar coordinates

00:50:47.011 --> 00:50:49.510
or something else, but by and
large the Cartesian coordinate

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.960
system is the
natural description

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.590
of Euclidean spaces.

00:50:54.590 --> 00:50:56.770
And the coordinates of a
Cartesian coordinate system

00:50:56.770 --> 00:50:59.510
really are distances.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:02.720
Once, however, you go
from Euclidean geometry

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.494
to non Euclidean geometry-- from
flat spaces to curved spaces--

00:51:08.494 --> 00:51:10.410
you're usually in a
situation where there just

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:13.410
is no natural coordinate system.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.716
When we invented
this psi, theta, phi,

00:51:16.716 --> 00:51:18.840
we really made a number of
arbitrary choices there.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.756
We could have defined
things quite differently

00:51:20.756 --> 00:51:22.710
if we wanted to.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.710
So in general, one has
to deal with the fact

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:30.640
that the coordinates no
longer represent distances,

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.150
and therefore there's
a lot of arbitrariness

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.960
in the way you choose the
coordinates in the first place.

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:45.250
So in particular, we
could think of psi

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:48.890
equals zero as the center of
our new coordinate system,

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.885
with coordinates
psi, theta, and phi.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:56.900
psi equals 0 corresponds
to being along the w axis,

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.490
so it's a unique point.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.180
When you say that
psi is equal to 0,

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:03.300
it no longer matters
what theta and phi are.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:08.379
You're at the point w equals
r and x, y, and z equals 0.

00:52:08.379 --> 00:52:09.920
So we can think of
that as the origin

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.060
of our new coordinate system.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.768
And we can think of
then the value of psi

00:52:12.768 --> 00:52:15.620
as measuring how far we
are from that origin.

00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.610
So psi will become
our radial coordinate.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.745
So thinking of it
as our sphere, psi

00:52:27.745 --> 00:52:32.680
equals 0 we might think of as
the North Pole this sphere.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.600
But we're also going to think of
it as the origin of psi, theta,

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.300
phi space.

00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:46.510
And we will sometimes use
other radial variables--

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:50.660
other variables for the
distance from the origin.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.490
So in particular,
another coordinate

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:55.430
that's very commonly
used is u, which

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:58.655
is just defined to be the
sine of the angle psi.

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.450
And notice that the
sine of the angle psi

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.810
shows up in a lot of equations.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.140
So taking that as
our natural variable

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:10.130
is a reasonable thing
to do on occasion.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.820
Both are useful.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:16.130
If we do use this, then
we can rewrite the metric

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:19.009
in terms of u, instead of psi.

00:53:19.009 --> 00:53:20.550
And in order to do
that, we just have

00:53:20.550 --> 00:53:24.014
to know how du relates to
d psi, because the metric

00:53:24.014 --> 00:53:25.680
is written in terms
of the differentials

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.680
of the coordinates.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:32.490
So that's easy to calculate.

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:38.510
du would be equal to
cosine of psi d psi.

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.850
But if we're trying to
rewrite the metric solely

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.340
in terms of u, we don't want
to have to divide or multiply

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.580
by cosine psi, because that's
written in terms of psi.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:54.930
But we could express
cosine psi in terms of u,

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:58.750
because if u equals sine
psi, then cosine psi

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.720
is the square root
of 1 minus u squared.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.990
So I can rewrite this as
the square root of 1 minus u

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.150
squared times d psi.

00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:20.030
And then d psi squared, which
is what appears in our metric,

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:27.930
can be rewritten just
using that as du squared

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.765
divided by 1 minus u squared.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:40.450
And the full metric now, in
terms of the u theta and psi

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:49.470
coordinates, can be
written as r squared

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:55.170
times du squared over
1 minus u squared,

00:54:55.170 --> 00:55:01.720
plus u squared times
d theta squared

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:06.670
plus sine squared
theta d phi squared.

00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:14.320
So this is another way
of writing the metric

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.887
for this three dimensional
sphere embedded

00:55:16.887 --> 00:55:18.095
in four Euclidean dimensions.

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.226
Any questions?

00:55:24.226 --> 00:55:25.112
Yes?

00:55:25.112 --> 00:55:26.820
AUDIENCE: The value
of u doesn't uniquely

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.700
determine a point on
the sphere, right?

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.530
Because [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.910
PROFESSOR: Very good point.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.375
In case you didn't
hear the question,

00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:37.470
it was pointed out
that the value of u,

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.090
unlike the value of psi, is
not uniquely indicate a point,

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:47.560
because on the entire sphere,
there are two points u

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.660
for every value of sine psi--
one in the northern hemisphere

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.240
and one in the
southern hemisphere,

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:57.910
if we think of
hemispheres as dividing

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:00.959
whether w is
positive or negative.

00:56:00.959 --> 00:56:02.000
So in fact, that's right.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.541
If we use the u
coordinate, we should

00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:05.890
remember that if we want to
talk about the whole sphere,

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:07.931
we should remember that
the whole sphere is twice

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.690
as big as what we
see if we just let

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:15.310
u vary between 0 and
its maximum value, 1.

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:18.620
u equals 1 corresponds to
the equator of this sphere.

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.130
Another point which I'd like to
make now that we've written it

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:33.021
this way is that writing it this
way is the easiest way to see--

00:56:33.021 --> 00:56:34.520
although we can see
it in other ways

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.430
as well-- that if u is very
small, if we look right

00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:42.210
in the vicinity of the origin
of our new coordinate system,

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:47.470
if u is very small, 1 minus
u squared is very close to 1.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.860
The square of a small
quantity is extra small,

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.790
so this denominator
is extra close to 1.

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:55.190
And that means that for
very small values of u,

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:59.570
what we have is du squared plus
u squared times this quantity.

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:05.470
And this is just polar
coordinates in Euclidean space.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.040
So for u very small, we do see
that we have a local Euclidean

00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:09.741
space.

00:57:09.741 --> 00:57:11.240
And that, if you
might remember, was

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.900
one of the key points
about writing the metric

00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:17.300
as the sum of squares
in the first place.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.080
And it's true about every point,
although the coordinate system

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.940
here only makes it
obvious about the origin.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.100
But we know that the space
actually is homogeneous,

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:25.610
from the way we constructed it.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:30.600
So what's true about the
origin is true about any point.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.860
So the coordinate
system, the metric

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.690
around any point, if
you look close enough

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.710
in the vicinity of the point,
looks like a Euclidean space,

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:41.196
which is what we expected
from the very beginning,

00:57:41.196 --> 00:57:42.820
but we can see it
very explicitly here.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:51.870
OK.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:54.270
So far, this is just geometry.

00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:57.530
But this will be a model
for a homogeneous, isotropic

00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:59.376
universe.

00:57:59.376 --> 00:58:00.750
We know it's
homogeneous, we know

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.770
it's isotropic from the
way we discussed it.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:05.420
When we write the
metric this way,

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.840
it's obvious that it's
isotropic about the origin,

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.910
because this construction we
know is just polar coordinates,

00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:12.390
and we know polar
coordinates don't

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:16.340
really single out any direction,
even though manifestly they

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.970
look like they
do, because you're

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:19.720
measuring angles
from the z-axis.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:24.290
But we know that really
describes an isotropic sphere.

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:26.350
It's not obvious that
this formula describes

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:28.160
a homogeneous space,
because it makes

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.220
it look like u equals
0 is a special point.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:33.450
But we do know that
it did correspond

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:35.820
to a homogeneous space from
the way we constructed it.

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:38.660
It really is just a
three dimensional sphere

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.880
embedded in four
Euclidean dimensions.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.300
And if you think of
it as the sphere,

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.620
there clearly is no special
point on the sphere.

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.950
So the homogeneity is a
feature of this metric,

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:51.240
but a hidden feature.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.070
It's hard to see how
you would transform

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:57.220
coordinates to, for example,
put a different point

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:58.240
at the origin.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.500
But it is possible, and
we know it's possible,

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.850
because of the way we
originally constructed.

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:04.820
And if we had to
do it, we go back

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:07.400
to the original construction
and actually do it.

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.820
That is, if I told you I wanted
some other point in that system

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.870
to be the origin, you
could trace it all way back

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:17.506
to the four dimensional
Euclidean space,

00:59:17.506 --> 00:59:19.880
and figure out how you have
to do a rotation in that four

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.590
dimensional Euclidean space to
make the point that I told you

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:25.510
I wanted to be the origin
to actually be the origin.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:27.520
So you'd be able to do that.

00:59:27.520 --> 00:59:29.610
It would be some work,
but you would in fact

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:30.960
know how to do that.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.934
We really do understand that
the space is homogeneous, which

00:59:34.934 --> 00:59:36.725
is guaranteed by our
original construction.

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:40.990
OK.

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:43.510
Finish with the basic
geometry-- one more

00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:46.332
chance to ask any
questions about it.

00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:48.310
OK, next I want to
go on now to talk

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:51.230
about how this fits
into general relativity.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:53.890
And here we are going to
be confronting-- actually

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:57.150
the only place we ever will
confront-- the issue of how

00:59:57.150 --> 01:00:00.750
matter causes space
to curve, which

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.470
is the aspect of
general relativity

01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:04.690
that we're not really
going to do it all.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.690
So I'll basically just
be giving you the answer.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:11.110
Although we will in fact
know enough to narrow down

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.290
the range of possible
answers, pretty much.

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:15.669
But there will be a
fudge factor that I'll

01:00:15.669 --> 01:00:17.460
have to just tell you
the right answer for.

01:00:38.662 --> 01:00:40.120
So what I want to
do now is to make

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:46.370
a connection between this
formalism and the model

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:49.750
that we already discussed of
the expanding universe whose

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:54.570
dynamics we derived using
Newtonian mechanics.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:56.930
So using internet
Newtonian mechanics,

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.380
we introduced a
scale factor a of t.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:06.600
And convinced ourselves
that a dot over a squared

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:13.870
is equal to 8 pi over
3 g rho, minus kc

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:17.580
squared over a squared.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.230
And furthermore,
that this a of t

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:23.900
describes the relationship
between physical distances

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.976
and coordinate distances.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:35.180
Namely, if we have objects that
are at rest in this expanding

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:38.930
universe, comoving objects
is the phrase usually used

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.300
to describe that.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.170
If we have comoving objects,
the comoving objects

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:47.254
will sit at fixed coordinates
in our coordinate system.

01:01:47.254 --> 01:01:48.920
And the distance
between any two of them

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:53.470
will be some fixed distance-- l
sub c-- a coordinate distance.

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:56.310
But the physical distance will
vary with time, proportional

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:57.810
to this scale factor.

01:01:57.810 --> 01:02:00.896
So the physical distance
between any two points

01:02:00.896 --> 01:02:02.270
will be a function
of time, which

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:05.285
is the scale factor times the
time-independent coordinate

01:02:05.285 --> 01:02:05.785
distance.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.040
OK, if we look at our metric
for this sphere, and say

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.550
we're going to
assume that this is

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:18.270
going to be the metric that
describes the space that we're

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:25.415
describing over here, then
clearly this r that sits out

01:02:25.415 --> 01:02:29.540
front rescales all
of the distances.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.240
All the distances are
proportional to r,

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.590
just as all the distances
here are proportional to a.

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:39.770
So that could only work
if r is proportional to a.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:43.890
So that's our key
conclusion here--

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:48.910
that r is going to
have to vary with time,

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.230
and be proportional to a.

01:02:56.219 --> 01:02:57.760
But we can even say
a little bit more

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.510
than that, because we can
look at dimensionality.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:05.390
And here comes in handy that
I insisted from the beginning

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:07.050
in introducing this
idea of a notch.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:10.400
The notch helps us here
to get this formula right.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:18.195
The units of r-- r is just
distance-- so the units of r

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.800
are just distance
units-- and I'll

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.550
pretend that we're using meters.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:25.370
It doesn't really matter what
actual units we're using,

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:29.100
so I'll call this m for meters.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:39.440
On the other hand, a of t
comes from this formula, where

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.240
physical distances are
measured in meters,

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.000
but coordinate distances
are measured in notches,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.790
so a is meters per notch, as
we've said many times before.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.795
So a of t is meters per notch.

01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:56.850
So that tells us something
about this constant

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.710
of proportionality-- it has to
have the right units to turn

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.170
meters per notch into meters.

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:06.360
That is, it has to
have units of notches.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.800
Where did we get notches from?

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:16.530
The other thing that we know
is that the little k that

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:19.570
appears in the Friedman
equation, which we know

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:22.500
is a constant-- we also
know it's a constant that

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.090
has units of 1 over notches
squared, as we worked out

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:27.860
some time ago.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.165
Units of k is 1 over
notches squared.

01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:52.090
And that's the only
thing around that

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.040
we can find that has
units of notches,

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.810
so we're going to use that
to make the units turn out

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.500
right in this equation.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:05.650
So to get the units right,
we can write it as r of t

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:09.535
is equal to some
constant-- actually, it's

01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:13.050
more convenient to square
this-- r squared of t

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:22.050
is equal to some constant times
a squared of t, divided by k.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:24.210
And now that constant
is dimensionless.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:28.330
The units are all built into the
a's and the k's and everything

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:28.830
else.

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.245
AUDIENCE: Is the constant
multiplied by that, or--

01:05:32.245 --> 01:05:32.870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:40.030
That equals sign
was a big mistake.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:43.070
Constant times a squared over k.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.990
And that constant is
now dimensionless.

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:47.690
Because this is
meters squared, this

01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:49.260
is meters squared
per notch squared,

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.540
and this is just
per notch squared,

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.950
so the notches cancel over here.

01:05:56.060 --> 01:06:01.210
OK, now what this
constant is really

01:06:01.210 --> 01:06:03.705
is the statement
of how curved is

01:06:03.705 --> 01:06:05.100
our space-- r is
really a measure

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:08.320
the curvature of our space-- how
curved is our space for a given

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.140
description of what
the matter is doing?

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.590
a of t is directly related to
the [INAUDIBLE] calculations

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:16.220
you've already done.

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:19.700
So this clearly is a
formula of exactly the type

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:24.290
that I told you we weren't
going to learn how to deal with.

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:28.550
We're not capable in this course
of describing the Einstein

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:31.940
field equations,
which determine how

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:35.660
matter causes a space to curve.

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.080
So I'll just tell
you the answer.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.590
The answer is that this
constant is equal to 1.

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.600
So it's certainly
a simple answer,

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.330
but we won't be
able to derive it.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.010
So we end up with
just r squared of t

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.234
is equal to a squared
of t, divided by k.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:35.540
Now it may be useful at this
point to remind ourselves

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.830
what little k meant
in the first place.

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:40.100
We introduced little
k in the context

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.790
of describing a purely
Newtonian model of an expanding

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:46.460
universe, where we imagined
just a finite sphere of matter

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:47.760
expanding.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:53.430
And in doing that,
we defined k to be

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:59.750
equal to minus 2 e
divided by c squared,

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:05.040
where e itself was not a
quantity that we proved

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.360
was conserved.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.042
And it's related to an
energy, but as we discussed,

01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:14.000
there are various ways
that you could relate it

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.140
to the energies of different
pieces of the system.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.880
But e was given by
that expression.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:36.340
And if I put this
into that, just

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:42.590
to see more clearly how
our discussion relates

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.950
to our Newtonian
discussion, we get

01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:53.227
r squared is equal to a squared
of t times c squared over 2 e.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.870
And I wrote it this way mainly
to illustrate, or demonstrate,

01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:06.010
an important point, which
is that our calculation was

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:09.715
non-relativistic,
but there's a c

01:09:09.715 --> 01:09:12.290
squared appearing
in this formula.

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:15.819
This c squared really just
arose from our definitions.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.479
And if we had some
other quantity here

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:23.301
whose units were--
we have to sub

01:09:23.301 --> 01:09:25.884
units of meters per second for
this formula to come out right.

01:09:25.884 --> 01:09:28.220
If we put some
other velocity here,

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.279
then this constant would not be
1 anymore, but something else.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.044
So saying that
this constant is 1

01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:37.149
is saying that this
formula is meaningful.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:39.790
Putting the c squared
there simplifies things.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:43.740
And that in turn means
that the curvature really

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.479
is a relativistic effect.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.010
OK, we think of
relativistic effects

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:50.229
as effects that disappear
as the speed of light

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:51.975
goes to infinity.

01:09:51.975 --> 01:09:54.100
So this formula tells us
that as the speed of light

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.720
goes to infinity-- for
fixed values of things

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.971
like the mass density, which
are buried in a squared of t--

01:09:59.971 --> 01:10:01.970
as the speed of light
goes to infinity for fixed

01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:07.950
values of the mass density,
r squared goes to infinity.

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:10.590
Now infinity may sound
like it's backwards,

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:12.230
but it's the right way.

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:13.880
1 over r is really
the curvature.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:16.070
r is the radius of
curvature of the space.

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:18.610
As r goes to infinity,
our curved space

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.210
looks more and more flat.

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:22.170
So we're saying that
if you could imagine

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.602
varying the speed of light,
as you made the speed of light

01:10:24.602 --> 01:10:26.060
larger and larger,
this space would

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:28.180
become flatter and flatter.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.320
So this curvature
of the space really

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.350
is a relativistic effect,
which is related to the fact

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:36.830
that the speed of light is
finite and not infinite.

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:37.695
Yes?

01:10:37.695 --> 01:10:39.570
AUDIENCE: Sorry, when
we replace a with that,

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:41.140
are we missing a minus sign?

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.473
PROFESSOR: Oh we might be, yeah.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.595
Minus sign now fixed.

01:10:51.595 --> 01:10:53.720
The point is that for the
case we're talking about,

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.650
e would be negative and
k would be positive.

01:10:56.650 --> 01:11:01.180
So this formula needs an
absolute value sign in it.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:01.680
Thank you.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.400
OK, it may also be
useful to relate r

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:22.400
more directly to astronomical
observables, which we can do,

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.670
because we have the
Friedman equation up there,

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.770
which relates a to rho.

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:35.820
And a dot over a is also
the Hubble expansion rate,

01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.240
so that's h squared.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.640
So this formula
tells exactly how

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.115
to write a in terms
of rho and h squared.

01:11:43.409 --> 01:11:44.950
And in fact, it
tells us how to write

01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:48.940
a over the square root of k
in terms of rho and H squared.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:53.600
And that's exactly what r
is-- it's a squared over k.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.960
So putting those
equations together,

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.010
we could write r is equal to c
times the inverse of the Hubble

01:12:02.010 --> 01:12:09.260
expansion rate, over the
square root of omega minus 1.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:16.020
Where omega you would
call is equal to rho

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.690
divided by rho sub c.

01:12:18.690 --> 01:12:27.530
And rho sub c is 3 h squared
over 8 pi-- Newton's constant.

01:12:36.087 --> 01:12:37.420
So this formula says two things.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.730
It says that the
radius of curvature

01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:42.030
becomes infinite
if c were infinite.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:43.520
And that says what
I already said,

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.502
that's a relativistic effect.

01:12:45.502 --> 01:12:47.210
It also tells you the
radius of curvature

01:12:47.210 --> 01:12:50.550
goes to 0 as omega goes to 1.

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:53.870
So omega approaching 1 is
the flat universe case,

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.710
which is what we've
already mumbled about,

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.980
but this formula shows
it very directly.

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:02.360
As omega approaches 1,
for a fixed value of h

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.650
and a fixed value of
the speed of light,

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:06.430
the radius of curvature
goes to infinity.

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.971
The space becomes
more and more flat.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.180
Look, I'm just going to
write one more formula, which

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:30.090
is really just a redefinition,
but an important redefinition

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.210
as far as where we're
going to be going next.

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:35.640
And then we'll finish
today's lecture,

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.840
and continue next week.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:50.290
What I wanted to do is to
put these definitions back

01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:55.310
into the metric itself.

01:13:55.310 --> 01:14:02.520
So we can write ds squared is
equal to a squared of t divided

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.040
by k-- which is what we
previously called r squared--

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.530
times du squared over
1 minus u squared,

01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:19.510
plus u squared times d theta
squared plus sine squared

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:23.390
theta d phi squared.

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:31.350
And now what I want to do is
make one further redefinition

01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:35.090
of this radial variable, which,
remember, initially was psi.

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:38.050
Then we let u be equal
to the sine of psi.

01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:40.110
Now I'm going to make
one further substitution.

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:46.920
I'm going to let little
r be equal to u divided

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:51.900
by the square root of k,
to bring this k inside.

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.170
And that then is
also equal to sine

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:57.310
of psi, divided by
the square root of k.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.580
And when we do that, the metric
takes a slightly simpler form.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.190
ds squared is equal
to a squared of t

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:08.960
all by itself on
the outside now.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.710
And then this, after
we factor in the k,

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:23.840
becomes dr squared over
1 minus k r squared,

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:29.930
plus r squared times
d theta squared

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:34.490
plus sine squared
theta, d phi squared.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.339
And this is the form that the
metric is usually written in.

01:15:46.339 --> 01:15:48.005
It's called the
Robertson-Walker metric.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.390
So we've only discussed
closed universes.

01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:21.580
I had hoped to discuss
closed and open,

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.300
but open will in fact
follow very quickly

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.870
from what we already have.

01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:29.310
So we'll begin next time by
discussing open universes.
